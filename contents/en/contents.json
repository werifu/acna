    "content": "RESTORING ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE: Today, President Donald J. Trump’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) took action to implement President Trump’s Executive Action titled “Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce.”\n- OPM proposed a rule to amend the civil service regulations to include Schedule Policy/Career for career employees with important policy-determining, policy-making, policy-advocating, or confidential duties.\n\nThese employees will serve as at-will employees, without access to cumbersome adverse action procedures or appeals, overturning Biden Administration regulations that protected poor performing employees.\n\n\n\nLine federal employees who implement those policies, like Border Patrol agents or wage and hour inspectors, will generally be excluded.\n- These employees will serve as at-will employees, without access to cumbersome adverse action procedures or appeals, overturning Biden Administration regulations that protected poor performing employees.\n- Line federal employees who implement those policies, like Border Patrol agents or wage and hour inspectors, will generally be excluded.\n- This rule empowers federal agencies to swiftly remove employees in policy-influencing roles for poor performance, misconduct, corruption, or subversion of Presidential directives, without lengthy procedural hurdles.\n- Schedule Policy/Career positions remain career positions, filled through existing nonpartisan, merit-based hiring processes.\n\nThese employees will keep their competitive status and are not required to personally or politically support the President, but must faithfully implement the law and the administration’s policies.\n- These employees will keep their competitive status and are not required to personally or politically support the President, but must faithfully implement the law and the administration’s policies.\n- OPM estimates 50,000 positions will ultimately be moved into Schedule Policy/Career, approximately 2% of the Federal workforce.\n\nThe proposed rule does not directly move positions into Schedule Policy/Career. That will be done by a subsequent executive order after a final rule issues.\n- The proposed rule does not directly move positions into Schedule Policy/Career. That will be done by a subsequent executive order after a final rule issues.\nFIXING A BROKEN SYSTEM: The proposed rule tackles systemic issues in federal workforce accountability, addressing unaccountable, policy-determining federal employees who put their own interests ahead of the American people’s.\n- Federal employees report their agencies do not hold employees accountable:\n\nThe Merit Principles Survey shows less than a quarter of federal employees believe their agencies address poor performers effectively.\n\n\n\nWhen asked what typically happens to poor performers in their work unit, federal employees’ most common response is they “remain in the work unit and continue to underperform.”\n- The Merit Principles Survey shows less than a quarter of federal employees believe their agencies address poor performers effectively.\n- When asked what typically happens to poor performers in their work unit, federal employees’ most common response is they “remain in the work unit and continue to underperform.”\n- This happens because the process for removing federal employees is lengthy and difficult:\n\nThe Government Accountability Office reports it takes 6 months to a year to remove poor performers, even before appeals.\n\n\n\nOnly two-fifths of federal managers are confident they could remove employees who committed serious misconduct.\n\n\n\nJust one-quarter believe they could remove an employee for poor performance in a critical element of their job.\n- The Government Accountability Office reports it takes 6 months to a year to remove poor performers, even before appeals.\n- Only two-fifths of federal managers are confident they could remove employees who committed serious misconduct.\n- Just one-quarter believe they could remove an employee for poor performance in a critical element of their job.\n- Unaccountability allows corruption to fester in agencies:\n\nFor example, a recent audit of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) found widespread misconduct by senior leaders, such as male supervisors pressuring female subordinates for sexual favors in exchange for career assistance.\n\n\n\nThe FDIC almost never seriously disciplined employees for such corrupt behavior. Not a single complaint to the agency’s Anti-Harassment program resulted in a removal, or even a demotion.\n\n\n\nThe auditors found the FDIC tolerated misconduct because the removal process was too difficult to use.\n- For example, a recent audit of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) found widespread misconduct by senior leaders, such as male supervisors pressuring female subordinates for sexual favors in exchange for career assistance.\n- The FDIC almost never seriously disciplined employees for such corrupt behavior.

For the government to be accountable to the American people, elected officials must be able to hold policy-determining and policy-making career employees accountable for their performance and conduct.\nDRAINING THE SWAMP: President Trump is delivering on his promise to dismantle the deep state and reclaim our government from Washington corruption.\n- In his first term, President Trump signed an Executive Order to reclassify certain federal workers in policy-related roles as “Schedule F” employees, enabling swift accountability for those in influential positions.\n- When President Biden took office, he revoked this Executive Order, reinstating protections that shielded unaccountable bureaucrats.\nPresident Trump vowed on the campaign trail to reinstate this Executive Order, a promise he kept on his first day returning to office."

    "content": "On the evening of April 18, 1775, two lanterns were illuminated from the tower of The Old North Church in Boston to alert the colonists that British forces were advancing across the Charles River.  With the alert signal in place, Paul Revere, a silversmith dedicated to the cause of independence, mounted a borrowed horse and embarked on a midnight journey that became a defining moment in American history. The dangerous mission was threefold.  First, sound the alarm for colonists in farms and villages throughout the Massachusetts countryside.  On the way, stop in Lexington to inform the leaders of the colonial resistance, Samuel Adams and John Hancock, that the British were coming to arrest them.  Finally, prevent the seizure of military provisions and munitions stored a few miles west in the town of Concord. Disregarding personal peril or consequence, Paul Revere rode with urgency into the night.  After successfully warning Adams and Hancock, Revere was intercepted by a British patrol just before reaching Concord.  Yet, Revere had already achieved his most important mission—relaying the news of the impending British advancement to his fellow patriots.  Samuel Prescott and William Dawes evaded detection and carried the news on to Concord, giving the fledgling colonial army a critical advantage against the advancing Redcoats.  Paul Revere’s Midnight Ride enabled our troops to prepare for battle and their eventual victory.  By early the next morning, the first shots rang out in Lexington Green, signaling the start of the American Revolution. In 1860, the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow immortalized “Paul Revere’s Ride” in a poem that generations of schoolchildren across America have read and recited.  On this 250th anniversary, we remember the stirring words that so beautifully capture the urgency and heroism of that fateful night: “Listen my children, and you shall hearOf the midnight ride of Paul Revere… A cry of defiance, and not of fear,A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,And a word that shall echo forevermore!”  With these timeless verses, Longfellow ensured that Revere’s harrowing ride for freedom would never be forgotten. Paul Revere was a master craftsman, a husband, a father, and a proud son of liberty, who risked his life to help forge a new Nation.  His courageous ride ignited patriots across the colonies who rose up to defend their families, their livelihoods, and their sacred liberties.  On the 250th anniversary of Paul Revere’s Midnight Ride, we commemorate the enduring legacy of the famed Boston silversmith, patriot, and revolutionary hero, whose passion for independence and bold act of defiance set in motion a war of independence that changed the course of history and transformed the world."

    "content": "Today, the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (Permitting Council) announced increased transparency, accountability, and predictability for the permitting review process for the first wave of critical mineral production projects—with many more projects on the way—in response to President Trump’s Executive Order, Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production. Identifying these transparency projects under the Permitting Council’s statutory program advances the President’s directive to take immediate action to facilitate domestic production of America’s vast mineral resources to create jobs, fuel prosperity, and significantly reduce our reliance on foreign nations.\n“This is the first use of the Permitting Council’s transparency authority, and we look forward to showcasing the many benefits the Federal Permitting Dashboard can bring to critical infrastructure projects as part of President Trump’s Executive Order on increasing American mineral production,” said Manisha Patel, Acting Executive Director at the Permitting Council. “The Federal Permitting Dashboard is a vital tool in enhancing interagency coordination and efficient decision making and will play an invaluable role in ensuring that these projects receive the most efficient review and authorization process possible in order to bring the benefits of next generation infrastructure to communities across the nation.”\nIn response to the Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production Executive Order, the chair of the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC) submitted the first in a series of lists of mineral production projects to be identified as transparency projects on the Federal Permitting Dashboard to the Permitting Council Acting Executive Director. This is just the beginning—many more projects are expected to be added to the list on a rolling basis over the next few weeks. Inclusion on the Permitting Dashboard as a transparency project makes the environmental review and authorizations schedule for these vital mineral production projects publicly available and allows all of these projects to benefit from increased transparency. The public nature of the dashboard ensures that all stakeholders, from project sponsors and community members to federal agency leaders have up-to-date accounting of where each project stands in the review process. This transparency leads to greater accountability, ensuring a more efficient process.\nInitial selected projects include:\n• Resolution Copper Project• Stibnite Gold Project• Warrior Met Coal Mines• McDermitt Exploration Project• South West Arkansas Project• Caldwell Canyon Mine Project• Libby Exploration Project• Lisbon Valley Copper Project• Silver Peak Lithium Mine• Michigan Potash\nFor further information about these projects, please visit Federal Permitting Dashboard’s Transparency Projects Tab.

Trump and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni held their first official meeting yesterday in Washington, D.C., where they confirmed their resolve to promote a mutually beneficial relationship and further strengthen the U.S. – Italy strategic alliance across security, economic, and technological issues.U.S.- Italy Cooperation for SecurityThe U.S. and Italy underscore that the war in Ukraine must end, and fully endorse President Trump’s leadership in brokering a ceasefire and delivering a just and lasting peace.     The U.S. and Italy reiterate the unwavering commitment to NATO and to the principle of developing their collective and individual capacity to contribute to the Alliance’s goals. We therefore commit to ensuring our national security and defense are aligned and funded to meet the challenges of today, and critically, the risks of tomorrow.     Our defense cooperation must rely on a deep and extensive transatlantic supply chain. We are facing a complex security environment, and we are ready to further increase defense equipment and technology cooperation, including co-production and co-development that strengthen U.S. and Italian defense industrial capacity and protect it from foreign adversaries.     The U.S. and Italy reaffirm their shared commitment to counter illegal immigration and to ensure that legal migration is used as a tool to benefit our nations and not to create a security problem for our citizens. We will step up our common efforts to eradicate international organized crime groups engaged in migrant smuggling and human trafficking.     The U.S. and Italy confirm their joint effort to fight the production, distribution, and sale of illicit synthetic drugs, especially synthetic opioids and the criminal networks trafficking these drugs, which collectively damage the health, security, and well-being of our citizens and people around the world.U.S. – Italy Cooperation for Shared ProsperityThe United States and Italy agree to work to ensure that trade between the United States and Europe is mutually beneficial, fair, and reciprocal.     We highlight the importance of information technology to enabling free enterprise across the Atlantic. We agreed that a non-discriminatory environment in terms of digital services taxation is necessary to enable investments from cutting-edge tech companies.     We welcome American investments in AI computing and cloud services in Italy to maximize the opportunities of digital transformation and support Italy as the key regional data hub for the Mediterranean and North Africa.      Developing a workforce that can deliver on the needs of our economies is vital. The United States and Italy are proud partners in industrial endeavors that will benefit employment in both countries, playing a vital role for each other’s supply chains and strengthening our industrial bases. Italy will contribute to the maritime renaissance of the U.S. shipbuilding sector, while the U.S. will look into the investment opportunities offered by the increasingly positive Italian business environment, including through the incentives granted by the new Single Special Economic Zone (SEZ) established in Italy.     The U.S. and Italy cooperate to strengthen energy security by further encouraging the diversification of Italy’s energy supply source and by increasing exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Italy in a mutually beneficial manner.     The U.S. and Italy will work together to develop the India–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor, one of the greatest economic integration and connectivity projects of this century, connecting partners by ports, railways, and undersea cables and stimulating economic development and integration from India, to the Gulf to Israel, to Italy, and onward to the United States.      Following the example of the President Trump’s successful Abraham Accords approach, the U.S. and Italy will cooperate on crucial infrastructural projects and consider leveraging on the Mattei Plan’s potential.U.S. – Italy Cooperation for TechnologyThe United States and Italy recognize the need to protect our national critical and sensitive infrastructure and technology, which is why we commit to using only trusted vendors in these networks. There is no higher trust than our strategic alliance, which is why there can be no discrimination when it comes to U.S. and Italian vendors.     We are proud to partner on Space Technology, including through two Mars Missions in 2026 and 2028, and lunar surface exploration on future Artemis missions.     As we transition to and innovate on the technologies of the future, such as 6G, AI, quantum computing, and biotechnology, we also commit to exploring opportunities for enhanced partnerships in these critical industries that protect our data from adversaries that would exploit it.Invitation to Visit ItalyPresident Trump accepted Prime Minister Meloni’s invitation to pay an official visit to Italy in the very near future. There is also consideration to hold, on such occasion, a meeting between U.S. and Europe."

    "slug": "restoring-american-seafood-competitiveness",
    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Background.  The United States controls one of the largest and most abundant ocean resources in the world, with over 4 million square miles of prime fishing grounds.  With this vast resource and centuries of hard work from American fishermen, our Nation has the greatest seafood in the world.\nMost American fish stocks are healthy and have viable markets.  Despite these opportunities, seafood is one of the most heavily regulated sectors in the United States.  Federal overregulation has restricted fishermen from productively harvesting American seafood including through restrictive catch limits, selling our fishing grounds to foreign offshore wind companies, inaccurate and outdated fisheries data, and delayed adoption of modern technology.\nThe United States should be the world’s dominant seafood leader.  But in addition to overregulation, unfair trade practices have put our seafood markets at a competitive disadvantage.  Nearly 90 percent of seafood on our shelves is now imported, and the seafood trade deficit stands at over $20 billion.  The erosion of American seafood competitiveness at the hands of unfair foreign trade practices must end.\nSec. 2.  Purpose.  The United States must address unfair trade practices, eliminate unsafe imports, level the unfair playing field that has benefited foreign fishing companies, promote ethical sourcing, reduce regulatory burdens, and ensure the integrity of the seafood supply chain.  Previously, I signed Executive Order 13921 of May 7, 2020 (Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth).  That successful order — which remains in effect — enhanced the competitiveness of United States seafood, streamlined regulations, supported maritime jobs and coastal economies, and improved data collection.  During the past 4 years, our fishermen were once again crushed under the pressure of unnecessary regulations and unfavorable policies.  It is vital that we now build upon our previous hard work with new, additional measures to promote domestic fishing.\nSec. 3.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to promote the productive harvest of our seafood resources; unburden our commercial fishermen from costly and inefficient regulation; combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing; and protect our seafood markets from the unfair trade practices of foreign nations.\nSec. 4.  A New Era of Seafood Policy.  (a)  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and with input from the United States fishing industry, shall immediately consider suspending, revising, or rescinding regulations that overly burden America’s commercial fishing, aquaculture, and fish processing industries at the fishery-specific level.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce shall identify the most heavily overregulated fisheries requiring action and take appropriate action to reduce the regulatory burden on them, in cooperation with the Regional Fishery Management Councils, interagency partners, and through public-private partnerships, as appropriate.  This process shall include the following actions:\n(i)    The Secretary of Commerce shall request that each Regional Fishery Management Council, within 180 days of the date of this order, provide the Secretary of Commerce with updates to their recommendations submitted pursuant to Executive Order 13921, to reduce burdens on domestic fishing and to increase production.  Building upon the earlier goals, identified actions should stabilize markets, improve access, enhance economic profitability, and prevent closures.  The Regional Fishery Management Councils will commit to a work plan and a schedule for implementation to ensure these actions are prioritized.\n(ii)   The Secretary of Commerce shall solicit direct public comments, including from fishing industry members, technology experts, marine scientists, and other relevant parties, for innovative ideas to improve fisheries management and science within the requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.); the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.); the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.); and other applicable laws.\n(iii)  The Secretary of Commerce shall pursue additional direct public engagement to ensure executive departments and agencies (agencies) are focusing core fisheries management and science functions to directly support priority needs that strengthen our Nation’s seafood supply chain.\n(b)  Upon completion of the process described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Commerce shall consider updating the Department of Commerce’s contribution to the Unified Regulatory Agenda.  The Secretary of Commerce shall resume submission of annual reports to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality pursuant to these activities as described in Executive Order 13921.\n(c)  The Secretary of Commerce shall direct the National Marine Fisheries Service to incorporate less expensive and more reliable technologies and cooperative research programs into fishery assessments conducted pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1867.  As soon as practicable, the Secretary of Commerce shall expand exempted fishing permit programs to promote fishing opportunities nationwide.  Further, the Secretary of Commerce shall take all appropriate action to modernize data collection and analytical practices that will improve the responsiveness of fisheries management to real-time ocean conditions.\n(d)  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, shall develop and implement an America First Seafood Strategy to promote production, marketing, sale, and export of United States fishery and aquaculture products and strengthen domestic processing capacity.  This program shall accelerate the Department of Agriculture’s efforts to educate American consumers about the health benefits of seafood and increase seafood purchases in nutrition programs.\n(e)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with members of the Interagency Seafood Trade Task Force, shall assess seafood competitiveness issues and jointly develop a comprehensive seafood trade strategy.  The strategy shall be based upon the Seafood Trade Strategy of November 3, 2020, that improves access to foreign markets and addresses unfair trade practices — including IUU fishing and unjustified non-tariff barriers — while ensuring a fair and competitive domestic market for United States seafood producers.\n(f)  The United States Trade Representative shall examine the relevant trade practices of major seafood-producing nations, including with regard to IUU fishing and the use of forced labor in the seafood supply chain, and consider appropriate responses, including pursuing solutions through negotiations or trade enforcement authorities, such as under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411).\n(g)  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and other relevant agencies, shall immediately consider revising or rescinding recent expansions of the Seafood Import Monitoring Program to unnecessary species and further improve the program to more effectively target high-risk shipments from nations that routinely violate international fishery regulations.  The Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall use cost savings to improve thorough checks at United States ports to prevent IUU seafood from entering the market.  The Secretary of Commerce shall further consider options to use improved technology to identify foreign fishery-related violations.\n(h)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall review all existing marine national monuments and provide recommendations to the President of any that should be opened to commercial fishing.  In making these recommendations, the Secretary of Commerce will consider whether the opening of the monuments to commercial fishing would be consistent with the preservation of the historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest originally identified in the proclamations establishing the marine national monuments.\nSec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J. TRUMP\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nApril 17, 2025."

    "content": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nTwo and a half centuries ago, a small band of minutemen answered the call of freedom in the legendary Battles of Lexington and Concord, an epic tale of American strength and the first major armed conflict of the Revolutionary War.   We honor the memories, remember the sacrifices, and summon the courage of every hero of liberty who gallantly shed his blood for the cause of independence on April 19, 1775.\nAfter years of intensifying frictions and escalating hostility between the British Crown and the American Colonies, all avenues to peace and diplomacy had been exhausted, and it became clear to the patriots that war was inevitable.  Following the Boston Massacre, the oppressive Intolerable Acts, and the lasting grievance of taxation without representation, the colonists began organizing militias as a final recourse in defense of their right to self-government.\nThe British regime’s reign of tyranny reached a breaking point when, in his fearless midnight ride from Boston, Massachusetts, Paul Revere announced the news that the Redcoats were marching to Concord, Massachusetts, to arrest Colonial leaders and seize American arms.  By the time they reached Lexington at dawn, the British encountered 77 intrepid American minutemen, led by Captain John Parker, boldly standing their ground in defense of their independence.  The surprised British fired a volley, mortally wounding eight American patriots — the very first American soldiers to lay down their lives for our emerging Nation.\nThe British ambush at Lexington became known as the “shot heard ’round the world,” prompting thousands of brave young men to leave behind their homes and livelihoods to fight for our freedom on the frontlines of the American Revolution — commencing the greatest fight for liberty in the history of the world.\nLater that morning, the Redcoats arrived at Concord to find and set fire to patriot military supplies.  At the sight of rising smoke from atop a lofty hill, the colonists believed the Redcoats were burning the town, provoking them to advance to the North Bridge.  As Captain Isaac Davis, whose company stood at the front of the column, said of his soldiers gearing up to take on the Redcoats, “I haven’t a man who is afraid to go.”\nAs 400 daring militiamen descended down Punkatasset Hill toward the North Bridge, the startled British opened fire, killing 49 Americans, including Captain Davis.  “Fire, fellow soldiers, for God’s sake, fire!” shouted Major John Buttrick of the Concord militia at the sound of the discharging muskets — sending the British running back to Boston in retreat in a resounding victory for Colonial forces.  For the next 12 miles, the patriots relentlessly pursued the Redcoats, ambushing them from behind trees, walls, and other cover.  As one British soldier is said to have recalled, the Americans “fought like bears, and I would as soon storm hell as fight them again.”\nApril 19, 1775, stands to this day as a seminal milestone in our Nation’s righteous crusade for liberty and independence.  On this day 250 years ago, with the fire of freedom blazing in their souls, an extraordinary army of American minutemen defeated one of the mightiest armies on the face of the earth and laid the foundation for America’s ultimate triumph over tyranny.\nTwo and a half centuries later, their fortitude remains our inheritance, their resolve remains our birthright, and their unwavering loyalty to God and country remains the duty of every American patriot.  As we approach the 250th anniversary of our Nation’s independence next year, we honor the valiant men who fought in defense of their sacred right to self-government, we renew our pledge to restore our republic to all of its greatness and glory, and we commit to rebuilding a country and a culture that inspires pride in our past and faith in our future.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 19, 2025, as a day in commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord and the beginning of the American Revolutionary War.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand thisseventeenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.\nDONALD J.

    "content": "BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAA PROCLAMATION\nThe Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument (PRIMNM) was established by Proclamation 8336 of January 6, 2009 (Establishment of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument), and then further expanded by Proclamation 9173 of September 25, 2014 (Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument Expansion).  Under these monument proclamations, over 400,000 square miles in the Pacific Ocean were appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, location, selection, sale, leasing, or other disposition under the public land laws for care and management by the Federal Government.The PRIMNM was established to protect and preserve the lands and marine environment around Wake, Baker, Howland, and Jarvis Islands; Johnston and Palmyra Atolls; Kingman Reef; and the historic and scientific objects therein.  These objects include fish, birds, marine mammals, coral, and the general biodiversity of the ecosystems encompassed by the PRIMNM.As part of the management of the PRIMNM, commercial fishing is currently prohibited within its boundaries.  As explained herein, following further consideration of the nature of the objects identified in Proclamations 8336 and 9173 and the protection of those objects already provided by relevant law, I find that appropriately managed commercial fishing would not put the objects of scientific and historic interest that the PRIMNM protects at risk.With respect to fish in particular, fisheries in the region are effectively managed by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council.  Management of the PRIMNM is doing little to guard fish populations against overfishing as tunas and other pelagic species found within the boundaries of the PRIMNM are migratory in nature, and do not permanently reside within the PRIMNM.As a result of the prohibitions on commercial fishing, American fishing fleets have lost access to nearly half of the United States’ Exclusive Economic Zone in the Pacific Islands.  This has driven American fishermen to fish further offshore in international waters to compete against poorly regulated and highly subsidized foreign fleets.  This disadvantages honest United States commercial fishermen and is detrimental for United States territories like American Samoa, whose private sector economy is over 80 percent dependent on the fishing industry.Proclamations 8336 and 9173 do not list recreational fishing as a threat to local fish populations within the PRIMNM.  A host of Federal protections exist under current laws and agency management designations to protect the area’s natural resources, vulnerable marine species, and unique habitats, such as coral and seamount ecosystems.These laws include the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Endangered Species Act) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703-712), the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee), the Refuge Recreation Act (16 U.S.C. 460k et seq.), the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (Oil Pollution Act) (33 U.S.C. 2701et seq.), and Title I of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (Ocean Dumping Act), 33 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.  For example, the Endangered Species Act generally prohibits the taking of listed fish and wildlife species, and also generally ensures that Federal actions, including fisheries management, are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any such species nor adversely modify designated critical habitats.  Numerous other statutes, including the Clean Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act, and the Ocean Dumping Act, address both land-based and ocean-based sources of pollution and help ensure that water quality conditions support the conservation values of the Pacific Remote Island ecosystems.Therefore, I find that appropriately managed commercial fishing would not put objects of scientific and historic interest within the PRIMNM at risk.After further consideration of the nature of the objects identified in Proclamations 8336 and 9173 and the protection of those objects already provided by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and other relevant laws, I find that a prohibition on commercial fishing is not, at this time, necessary for the proper care and management of the PRIMNM or the objects of historic or scientific interest therein.NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (Antiquities Act), hereby proclaim that:(a)  All language under the section entitled “Management of the Marine National Monument” in Proclamation 9173 is deleted and replaced with the following:“Nothing in this proclamation shall change the management of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument as specified in Proclamation 8336.  The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall have primary responsibility for management of the Monument Expansion pursuant to applicable legal authorities.  The Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall within the Monument Expansion have primary responsibility with respect to fishery-related activities regulated pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), and any other applicable legal authorities.  The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior shall not allow or permit any appropriation, injury, destruction, or removal of any object of the Monument Expansion except as provided for by this proclamation as modified by the Proclamation of April 17, 2025 (Unleashing American Commercial Fishing in the Pacific).Between 50 to 200 nautical miles from the landward boundaries of the Monument, the Secretary of Commerce shall not prohibit commercial fishing within the boundaries of the Monument and the Monument Expansion in those areas where the Monument and Monument Expansion is coterminous with the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States.  The implementation of any regulation of commercial fishing within the Monument and the Monument Expansion shall be done in coordination with the Secretary of Defense.  Only United States flagged vessels shall be allowed to commercially fish within the boundaries of the Monument and the Monument Expansion, except that permits may be issued to foreign flagged vessels to transship fish harvested by United States fishermen.The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior shall take appropriate action pursuant to their respective authorities under the Antiquities Act; the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act; and such other authorities as may be available to implement this proclamation, to regulate fisheries, and to ensure proper care and management of the Monument Expansion.The United States shall continue to preserve the freedom of the seas (i.e., all of the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognized in international law and enjoyed by all nations, including the conduct of military activities, exercises, and surveys in or over the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States), and to protect the training, readiness, and global mobility of the United States Armed Forces as United States national interests that are essential to the peace and prosperity of civilized nations.The Secretary of Defense shall continue to manage Wake Island and Johnston Atoll as specified in Proclamation 8336.”.(b)  The Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shall expeditiously publish new proposed rules in the Federal Register to amend or repeal all burdensome regulations that restrict commercial fishing in the PRIMNM.Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to revoke, modify, or affect any withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation, other than the one created by Proclamations 8336 and 9173.Nothing in this proclamation shall change the management of the areas designated and reserved by Proclamations 8336 and 9173, except as explicitly provided in this proclamation.If any provision of this proclamation, including its application to a particular parcel of land, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and its application to other parcels of land shall not be affected thereby.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand thisseventeenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.                              DONALD J.

and             (ii)  make appropriate recommendations to advance the solicitation of commercial products or services where those products or services would be sufficient to serve the applicable procurement needs.     (c)  Within 120 days of the date of this order and annually thereafter, each agency’s approval authority shall provide a report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) detailing the agency’s compliance with FASA and its progress toward implementing the policies of this order.     Sec. 5.  Oversight of Non-Commercial Procurements.  (a)  Whenever an agency proposes to solicit a non-commercial product or service, the applicable contracting officer shall provide the agency’s approval authority with a description of the proposed procurement, which shall include the specific reasons a non‑commercial product or service is required, including all market research and price analysis in support of the proposed solicitation for such product or service.  The approval authority shall review and approve or deny the proposal in writing.      (b)  In conducting the review under subsection (a) of this section, the approval authority may seek input regarding the proposal from the Director of OMB.  In such cases, the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, shall review and assess the validity of the proposal, including the thoroughness of the market research and price analysis, and shall notify the approval authority in writing whether the Director of OMB recommends that the proposal be approved or denied.      Sec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:             (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof;

    "content": "Washington, D.C. – Today, President Trump announced a first-of-its-kind overhaul of Federal procurement policy in order to increase competition and efficiency while decreasing costs. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will conduct a sweeping review and rewrite of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).\nAs the world’s largest buyer, spending almost $1 trillion annually on procurement contracts, the Federal Government should be promoting agility, competition, and results. Instead, our procurement process, after decades of regulatory buildup, does the exact opposite. It benefits ineffective and entrenched vendors who can afford massive compliance costs at the expense of every other potential vendor.\nLed by OFPP, the FAR Council will rewrite the FAR in plain English, eliminate non-statutory and duplicative regulations, remove DEI and wokeness, and add buyer guides in place of burdensome and outdated requirements. The Federal Government will no longer procure useless and wasteful products like paper straws. It will focus on results above all else – the best products and services at the best cost.\nThe current FAR is over 2,000 pages long with nearly 3,000 complex and costly directives for potential vendors. These byzantine regulations have created a bureaucratic maze that stifle innovation, snuff out competition, and drive up costs.\nA transaction that takes days for a normal business takes months or years for the Federal Government, and costs much more. Buyers and vendors alike spend more time navigating this bureaucratic maze than on delivering the best products and value for the taxpayer. In one case, a mission-support contract was delayed nearly two years after a public comment triggered multiple cascading legal reviews and procedural challenges that resulted  in no real change to the acquisition strategy. Too often layered reviews and rigid compliance block progress and fail to meet the government’s needs.\nUnder President Trump’s leadership, those days are over. This long-overdue Revolutionary FAR Overhaul (RFO) will ensure a faster acquisition cycle, lower barriers to entry for small businesses, startups, and other new entrants, and eliminate wasteful bureaucratic bloat.\n“This RFO will reduce more than 40 years of bureaucratic buildup that will unleash our procurement system with generational change and results. We are Making America Great Again,” said OMB Senior Advisor Kevin Rhodes. To complement the RFO, a brand-new website will bring an unprecedented level of transparency to the procurement process, so that any member of industry or the general public can stay informed on regulatory updates, buyer guides, and the overall process."

    "content": "Today, President Trump took action to ensure the United States is leveraging modern technology to effectively and efficiently conduct environmental reviews and evaluate permits. Permitting reform is a top priority for the Trump Administration and this action will accelerate the process, improve the transparency and predictability of project timelines, and eliminate unnecessary delays holding back the growth of the American economy.\nThe Presidential Memorandum signed today calls on the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), in consultation with the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC) and relevant permitting agencies, to issue a plan for modernizing the technology used for Federal environmental review and permitting processes for infrastructure projects. This plan will guide agencies as they use technology to digitize permit applications, expedite reviews, enhance interagency coordination on projects, and given sponsors more transparency and predictability on project permitting schedules. This will also help agencies share information with state and tribal officials to make those permitting processes easier for project sponsors.\n“By leveraging 21st century technologies, the U.S. can improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and speed of the Federal environmental review and permitting process — and remove the layers of bureaucracy that are stopping growth while improving the quality of the review process. Thanks to the leadership of President Trump, CEQ will work diligently to issue a Federal Permitting Technology Action Plan and establish a Permitting Innovation Center that will truly enable agencies to expedite permitting and refocus environmental analysis on the issues of greatest importance,” said the White House Council on Environmental Quality.\n“We need to drill more, map more, mine more, and build more — all while innovating faster than our global competitors,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “The Permitting Technology Action Plan will channel our greatest asset, American innovation and technology, to overhaul our current permitting process and power our nation faster, better, cleaner, and more reliably than ever before. Embracing cutting-edge development and modernizing this outdated system will pave the way to American success.”\n“With President Trump’s leadership, this administration is taking action to fix a broken system that’s slowing down critical energy projects across the country. Outdated permitting systems are creating costly delays at the exact moment we need to be expanding capacity, strengthening our energy security, and building the infrastructure that powers American industry and lowers costs for families,” said Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “As Secretary of Energy and Vice Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council, I welcome this decisive action to modernize permitting technology, cut red tape, and align the full force of the federal government behind getting these essential projects approved and built—because energy dominance isn’t possible without the infrastructure to support it.”\n“When President Trump says American farmers and ranchers have been the lifeblood of our economy for centuries, he means it. For too long, our producers have experienced delays and uncertainty as they navigate a complex permitting process that gets in the way of American innovation and stifles energy and timber production. This historic Memorandum will increase efficiency and transparency so farmers, foresters, and producers can get back to the work they do every day to feed, fuel, and clothe our nation,” said Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins.\n“It takes too long to build in America,” said Secretary of Transportation Sean P. Duffy. “Ridiculous red tape and outdated regulations add cost and delays to projects. It has to stop. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we are slashing the bureaucracy and getting back to actually building things in America again. We are doing that by harnessing innovative technology to expedite the permitting process.”\n“I applaud President Trump for his actions to streamline environmental reviews and permitting processes which will bolster American innovation and grow our economy. Pillar Three of my Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative is permitting reform, cooperative federalism, and cross-agency partnership and under President Trump’s leadership, EPA will leverage technology to maximize efficiency and maintain the quality of review while expediting permits for infrastructure projects. No longer will applicants face years-long, uncertain, and costly permitting processes. Instead, we will safeguard our environment and incentivize investment into our economy creating American jobs,” said Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Lee Zeldin.\nTo read the Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, click here.\n"

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (the “Act”), it is hereby ordered:     Section 1.  Policy.  A strong national defense depends on a robust economy and price stability, a resilient manufacturing and defense industrial base, and secure domestic supply chains.  Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, in the form of processed minerals are essential raw materials and critical production inputs required for economic and national security.  Critical mineral oxides, oxalates, salts, and metals (processed critical minerals), as well as their derivative products — the manufactured goods incorporating them — are similarly foundational to United States national security and defense.     But processed critical minerals and their derivative products face significant global supply chain vulnerabilities and market distortions due to reliance on a small number of foreign suppliers.  These vulnerabilities and distortions have led to significant United States import dependencies.  The dependence of the United States on imports and the vulnerability of our supply chains raises the potential for risks to national security, defense readiness, price stability, and economic prosperity and resilience.     Processed critical minerals and their derivative products are essential for economic security and resilience because they underpin key industries, drive technological innovation, and support critical infrastructure vital for a modern American economy.  They are key building blocks of our manufacturing base and foundational to sectors ranging from transportation and energy to telecommunications and advanced manufacturing.  These economic sectors are, moreover, foundational to America’s national security.     Processed critical minerals and their derivative products are essential for national security because they are foundational to military infrastructure, energy infrastructure, and advanced defense systems and technologies.  They are key building blocks of our defense industrial base and integral to applications such as jet engines, missile guidance systems, advanced computing, radar systems, advanced optics, and secure communications equipment.     The United States manufacturing and defense industrial bases remain dependent on foreign sources for processed critical mineral products.  Many of these foreign sources are at risk of serious, sustained, and long-term supply chain shocks.  Should the United States lose access to processed critical minerals from foreign sources, the United States commercial and defense manufacturing base for derivative products could face significant shortages and an inability to meet demand.      Associated risks arise from a variety of factors.  First, global supply chains are prone to disruption from geopolitical tensions, wars, natural disasters, pandemics, and trade conflicts.     Second, major global foreign producers of processed critical minerals have engaged in widespread price manipulation, overcapacity, arbitrary export restrictions, and the exploitation of their supply chain dominance to distort world markets and thereby gain geopolitical and economic leverage over the United States and other competitors that depend on processed critical minerals to manufacture derivative products essential to their economic and national security and national defense. Therefore, the import dependence of the United States on processed critical minerals from foreign sources may pose a serious national security risk to the United States economy and defense preparedness.     Third, the risks arising from America’s import dependence on processed critical minerals also extend to derivative products that are integral to the United States economy and economic and national security.      For the United States to manufacture derivative products, it must have ready access to an affordable, resilient, and sustainable supply of processed critical minerals.  Simultaneously, a resilient and sustainable manufacturing base for derivative products is vital to creating a stable demand base for processed critical minerals.  Both must coexist to ensure economic stability and national security.     Finally, overreliance on a small number of geographic regions amplifies the risks posed by geopolitical instability and regional disruptions.     In light of the above risks and realities, an investigation under section 232 of the Act (section 232) is necessary to determine whether imports of processed critical minerals and their derivative products threaten to impair national security.      Sec. 2.  Definitions.  As used in this order:        (a)  The term “critical minerals” means those minerals included in the “Critical Minerals List” published by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) pursuant to section 7002(c) of the Energy Act of 2020 (30 U.S.C. 1606) at 87 FR 10381, or any subsequent such list.  The term “critical minerals” also includes uranium.        (b)  The term “rare earth elements” means the 17 elements identified as rare earth elements by the Department of Energy (DOE) in the April 2020 publication titled “Critical Materials Rare Earths Supply Chain.”  The term also includes any additional elements that either the USGS or DOE determines in any subsequent official report or publication should be considered rare earth elements.        (c)  The term “processed critical minerals” refers to critical minerals that have undergone the activities that occur after critical mineral ore is extracted from a mine up through its conversion into a metal, metal powder or a master alloy.  These activities specifically occur beginning from the point at which ores are converted into oxide concentrates; separated into oxides; and converted into metals, metal powders, and master alloys.         (d)  The term “derivative products” includes all goods that incorporate processed critical minerals as inputs.  These goods include semi-finished goods (such as semiconductor wafers, anodes, and cathodes) as well as final products (such as permanent magnets, motors, electric vehicles, batteries, smartphones, microprocessors, radar systems, wind turbines and their components, and advanced optical devices).     Sec. 3.  Section 232 Investigation.  (a)  The Secretary of Commerce shall initiate an investigation under section 232 to determine the effects on national security of imports of processed critical minerals and their derivative products.     (b)  In conducting the investigation described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Commerce shall assess the factors set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), labeled “Domestic production for national defense; impact of foreign competition on economic welfare of domestic industries,” as well as other relevant factors, including:             (i)    identification of United States imports of all processed critical minerals and derivative products incorporating such processed critical minerals;             (ii)   the foreign sources by percent and volume of all processed critical mineral imports and derivative product imports, the specific types of risks that may be associated with each source by country, and those source countries deemed to be of significant risk;            (iii)  an analysis of the distortive effects of the predatory economic, pricing, and market manipulation strategies and practices used by countries that process critical minerals that are exported to the United States, including the distortive effects on domestic investment and the viability of United States production, as well as an assessment of how such strategies and practices permit such countries to maintain their control over the critical minerals processing sector and distort United States market prices for derivative products;             (iv)   an analysis of the demand for processed critical minerals by manufacturers of derivative products in the United States and globally, including an assessment of the extent to which such manufacturers’ demand for processed critical minerals originates from countries identified under subsections (b)(ii) and (b)(iii) of this section;             (v)    a review and risk assessment of global supply chains for processed critical minerals and their derivative products;             (vi)   an analysis of the current and potential capabilities of the United States to process critical minerals and their derivative products; and             (vii)  the dollar value of the current level of imports of all processed critical minerals and derivative products by total value and country of export.     (c)  The Secretary of Commerce shall, consistent with applicable law, proceed expeditiously in conducting the investigation as follows:             (i)    Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit for internal review and comment a draft interim report to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Senior Counselor to the President for Trade and Manufacturing.             (ii)   Comments to the Secretary of Commerce from the officials identified in subsection (c)(i) of this section shall be provided within 15 days of submission of the draft interim report described in subsection (c)(i) of this section.             (iii)  The Secretary of Commerce shall submit a final report and recommendations to the President within 180 days of the investigation’s commencement.     (d)  In considering whether to make recommendations for action or inaction pursuant to section 232(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1862(b)), the Secretary of Commerce shall consider:             (i)    the imposition of tariffs as well as other import restrictions and their appropriate levels;             (ii)   safeguards to avoid circumvention and any weakening of the section 232 measures;             (iii)  policies to incentivize domestic production, processing, and recycling; and             (iv)   any additional measures that may be warranted to mitigate United States national security risks, as appropriate, under the President’s authority pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.).     Sec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:             (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or             (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.                              DONALD J.

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  My first term included numerous significant actions, including some of the most aggressive in recent history, to deliver lower prescription drug prices to American patients.  The message was clear:  no longer would the executive branch sit idly by as pharmaceutical manufacturers charged patients in our Nation more than those in other countries for the exact same prescription drugs, often made in the exact same places.\nThese actions included encouraging the development of generic and biosimilar alternatives to higher cost brand name prescription drugs and biologics to harness competitive forces and increase access to affordable medicines.  The United States also, for the first time, established a pathway to expand access to lower cost drugs imported from outside of the country.  Reform efforts ensured that Government-mandated discounts were passed through to patients instead of being retained by middlemen.  New price transparency rules were promulgated to allow patients, doctors, and employers to see the actual cost of prescription drugs before purchase.  Insulin copayments were capped for Medicare beneficiaries, and manufacturers, instead of patients and taxpayers, were forced to foot the bill through the provision of larger discounts.  I also called on the Congress to come to the table to help craft sustainable solutions that would promote innovation and affordable access for the long-term.  When the Congress refused, I proposed the test of an innovative new payment mechanism that would prevent drug manufacturers from charging our patients much higher prices than those found abroad.Combined, these bold actions were delivering real savings for American patients and set the foundation to dramatically narrow the price disparity between the United States and foreign nations over time.Unsurprisingly, the Biden Administration reversed, walked back, or neglected many of these initiatives, undoing the progress made for American patients.  The Biden Administration then signed into law the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, which included the Medicare Prescription Drug Negotiation Program.  While this program has the commendable goal of reducing the drug prices Medicare and its beneficiaries pay, its administratively complex and expensive regime has thus far produced much lower savings than projected.  Further, accompanying changes to the Medicare Part D program led to inflated premiums and diminished coverage choices for seniors, prompting a taxpayer-funded bailout of insurance companies offering Part D plans.  Finally, the program imposes price controls on small molecule prescription drugs, usually in tablet or capsule form, 4 years earlier than on large molecule biological products.  Known as the “pill penalty,” this discrepancy threatens to distort innovation by pushing investment towards expensive biological products, which are often indicated to treat rarer diseases, and away from small molecule prescription drugs, which are generally cheaper and treat larger patient populations.The American people deserve better.  It is time to restore the progress our Nation made in my first term to deliver lower prescription drug prices by putting Americans first and making America healthy again.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States that Federal health care programs, intellectual property protections, and safety regulations are optimized to provide access to prescription drugs at lower costs to American patients and taxpayers.\nSec. 3.  Improving upon the Inflation Reduction Act.  (a)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), consistent with sections 1191 to 1198 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320f-1320f-7) and other applicable law, shall propose and seek comment on guidance for the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program for initial price applicability year 2028 and manufacturer effectuation of maximum fair price under such program in 2026, 2027, and 2028.  The guidance shall improve the transparency of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, prioritize the selection of prescription drugs with high costs to the Medicare program, and minimize any negative impacts of the maximum fair price on pharmaceutical innovation within the United States.(b)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, in coordination with the Secretary, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director), and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall provide recommendations to the President on how best to stabilize and reduce Medicare Part D premiums.(c)  The Secretary shall work with the Congress to modify the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program to align the treatment of small molecule prescription drugs with that of biological products, ending the distortion that undermines relative investment in small molecule prescription drugs, coupled with other reforms to prevent any increase in overall costs to Medicare and its beneficiaries.\nSec. 4.  Reducing the Prices of High-Cost Drugs for Seniors.  Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Secretary shall take appropriate steps to develop and implement a rulemaking plan and select for testing, consistent with 42 U.S.C. 1315a(b)(2), a payment model to improve the ability of the Medicare

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1.  Purpose.  The Federal Government is the largest buyer of goods and services in the world –- yet conducting business with the Federal Government is often prohibitively inefficient and costly.  More than 40 years ago, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) was implemented to establish uniform procedures for acquisitions across executive departments and agencies (agencies).  The “vision” of the Federal Acquisition System, codified at section 1.102 of the FAR, is to “deliver on a timely basis the best value product or service to the customer, while maintaining the public’s trust and fulfilling public policy objectives[,]” but since its inception, the FAR has swelled to more than 2,000 pages of regulations, evolving into an excessive and overcomplicated regulatory framework and resulting in an onerous bureaucracy. Federal procurement under the FAR receives consistently negative assessments regarding its efficiency.  Comprehensive studies such as the 2024 Senate committee report entitled “Restoring Freedom’s Forge” and the 2019 report by the Advisory Panel on Streamlining and Codifying Acquisition Regulations, created by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114-92) and made up of experts in acquisition and procurement policy, conclude that the FAR is a barrier to, rather than a prudent vehicle for, doing business with the Federal Government.  Its harmful effects permeate various items paid for by American taxpayers, from commercial products like laptops and office supplies to major defense weapons systems.  The management and expenditure of nearly $1 trillion annually in procurements cannot continue on this trajectory.  Fortunately, its inadequacies are self-inflicted and can be remedied through a comprehensive reform of the FAR.  Executive Order 14192 of January 31, 2025 (Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation), established that the policy of the executive branch is to be prudent and financially responsible in the expenditure of funds and to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people.  Reforming the FAR will advance this objective.Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to create the most agile, effective, and efficient procurement system possible.  Removing undue barriers, such as unnecessary regulations, while simultaneously allowing for the expansion of the national and defense industrial bases is paramount.  Accordingly, the FAR should contain only provisions required by statute or essential to sound procurement, and any FAR provisions that do not advance these objectives should be removed.Sec. 3.  Definitions.  (a)  “FAR” means the Federal Acquisition Regulation codified at title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations. (b)  “Administrator” refers to the Administrator of the Office of Federal Public Procurement Policy.(c)  “Agency” means an executive department, a military department, or any independent establishment within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 101, 102, and 104(1), respectively, and any wholly owned Government corporation within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 9101.Sec. 4.  Reforming the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Administrator, in coordination with the other members of the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council), the heads of agencies, and appropriate senior acquisition and procurement officials from agencies, shall take appropriate actions to amend the FAR to ensure that it contains only provisions that are required by statute or that are otherwise necessary to support simplicity and usability, strengthen the efficacy of the procurement system, or protect economic or national security interests.Sec. 5.  Aligning Agency Supplements to the FAR.(a)  Within 15 days of the date of this order, each agency exercising procurement authority pursuant to the FAR shall designate a senior acquisition or procurement official to work with the Administrator and the FAR Council to ensure agency alignment with FAR reform and to provide recommendations regarding any agency-specific supplemental regulations to the FAR.  The Administrator, the FAR Council, and each agency designee under this subsection shall collaborate to identify and appropriately address FAR provisions that are inconsistent with the policy objectives described in section 2 of this order.   (b)  Within 20 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Administrator, shall issue a memorandum to agencies that provides guidance regarding implementation of this order.  That memorandum shall ensure consistency and alignment of policy objectives and implementation regarding changes to the FAR and agencies’ supplemental regulations to the FAR.  (c)  The memorandum issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall propose new agency supplemental regulations and internal guidance that promote expedited and streamlined acquisitions.  With respect to such proposals, the Administrator shall direct the appropriate agency and its subordinate agencies to adhere to the ten-for-one requirement described in Executive Order 14192. (d)  The Administrator and the FAR Council shall issue deviation and interim guidance, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, until final rules reforming the FAR are published.Sec. 6.  Regulatory Sunset.  In amending the FAR under section 4 of this order, the Administrator, in coordination with the FAR Council, shall:(a)  identify all FAR provisions not required by statute that will remain in the FAR;(b)  consider amending the FAR such that any provisions identified in accordance with subsection (a) of this section will expire 4 years after the effective date of the final rule promulgated in accordance with section 4 of this order unless renewed by the FAR Council; and(c)  consider whether any new FAR provision not required by statute that is promulgated after the effective date of the final rule promulgated in accordance with subsection (b) of this section should include a provision stating that it will expire 4 years after its effective date unless renewed by the FAR Council.Sec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.   THE WHITE HOUSE,    April 15, 2025."

GENERAL OF THE SOCIAL SECURITYADMINISTRATION\nSUBJECT:       Preventing Illegal Aliens from Obtaining Social Security Act Benefits\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct:\nSection 1.  Responsibility for Determining Eligibility for Public Benefits.  (a)  As set forth in Executive Order 14218 of February 19, 2025 (Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders), both Federal law (title IV of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193)) and principles of sound administration demand that taxpayer-funded benefits be provided only to eligible persons and not encourage or reward illegal immigration to the United States.  This interest is especially compelling with respect to Social Security Act benefits, which demand strict policing of fraud, waste, and abuse to ensure future eligible individuals receive the benefits to which they are entitled.  Consequently, this memorandum gives additional direction for implementing Executive Order 14218 with regard to Social Security Act programs.\n(b)  The Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Commissioner of Social Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security as necessary, shall take all reasonable measures, consistent with applicable law, to ensure ineligible aliens are not receiving funds from Social Security Act programs.  Such measures shall include promulgating any necessary guidance or regulations regarding Social Security Act funds and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with law, prioritizing civil or administrative enforcement actions against States, localities, or other similar grantees or subgrantees that do not take adequate measures to verify eligibility, stop payments to deceased or otherwise ineligible payees, or otherwise prevent ineligible aliens from receiving funds from Social Security Act programs.\n(c)  The Attorney General and the Commissioner of Social Security shall cooperate to detail and credential such Special Assistant United States Attorneys as are necessary to expand the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) full-time fraud prosecutor program to at least 50 United States Attorney Offices by October 1, 2025.  Likewise, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall cooperate to establish a similar fraud-prosecutor program utilizing Special Assistant United States Attorneys with regard to programs administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which shall operate in at least 15 United States Attorney Offices by October 1, 2025.  Detailees in both programs shall emphasize prosecutions of identity theft and beneficiary-side fraud.  To the extent feasible, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Commissioner of Social Security, as applicable, shall prioritize assigning new detailees in both programs to the 10 United States Attorney Offices whose jurisdictions encompass the largest known populations of illegal aliens, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n(d)  The risk of beneficiary- or recipient-side fraud and abuse by illegal aliens shall also be reduced through other program-integrity measures.\n(i)    The Inspector General of the SSA noted in a July 2023 audit that death information regarding millions of deceased number holders is missing from the agency’s files, which obstructs efforts to prevent and detect fraud and improper payments across the Government with respect to executive departments and agencies that rely on SSA’s information.  The Commissioner of Social Security shall fully implement the recommendations in the Inspector General of the SSA’s Audit Report A-06-21-51022.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall cooperate fully with such implementation.\n(ii)   The same audit report revealed that the SSA does not investigate or attempt to resolve reports of earnings received by individuals age 100 or older if the SSA has not recorded death information for such individuals, even when the reported wage-earner does not match the name or other personally identifiable information in SSA records, which may indicate identity theft, illegal work, tax evasion, or other unlawful activity.  The Commissioner of Social Security shall refer promptly to the Inspector General of the SSA all earnings reports for persons age 100 or older when the purported wage-earner’s name does not match SSA’s files.  The Inspector General of the SSA shall investigate such matters as appropriate and refer matters to the Department of Justice, other executive departments and agencies, or local prosecutors as warranted.\n(iii)  Finally, within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the Commissioner of Social Security shall review whether, and under what conditions, SSA should resume pursuing civil monetary penalties under section 1129 of the Social Security Act.  If the Commissioner of Social Security determines that resumption is warranted, he shall either resume such program immediately or pursue regulatory or policy changes that would allow its resumption in a timely manner.\nSec. 2.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(d)  The Commissioner of Social Security is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nDONALD J.

    "content": "THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICAN INNOVATION\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nEndless Frontiers Retreat, Austin, Texas\nApril 14, 2025\nTHE DIRECTOR: Thank you for the kind introduction. It is a pleasure to speak to you all this evening, here in the early light of the new Golden Age of America.\nPresident Trump has given all of us who serve in his administration a monumental task—the renewal of our nation.\nI know, and I think you know, too, that such a renewal will require the reinvigoration of American science and industry. Over the last few decades, America has become complacent, forgetting old dreams of building a wondrous future.\nBut we know the American pioneer spirit still seeks the exploration of endless frontiers. Our technologies, and what we do with them, will be the tools with which we will make the destiny of our country manifest in this century.\nYet this American hope in the possibility of progress and the power of science and technology does not allow builders and innovators to retreat from politics. Indeed, quite the opposite, which is what brings me here today. A Golden Age is only possible if we choose it.\n***\nThere is nothing predestined about technological progress and scientific discovery. They require the efforts and energies of men and women, the collective choice for order and truth over disorder and opinion.\nThe last century was called the American Century, as—despite wars and domestic conflict—the United States stood at the forefront of science and technology, building the future. With the strength of our industry and ingenuity, we created the largest middle class the world has ever seen. As President Trump said to me in his letter laying out the science and technology agenda of this administration, “The triumphs of the last century did not happen by chance.”\nOurs was the Atomic Age. Ours the victory in the Space Race. And ours the invention of the Internet, collecting and connecting the multiplicity of human knowledge.\nToday we fight to restore that inheritance. As the failure of the Biden administration’s “small yard, high fence” approach makes clear, it is not enough to seek to protect America’s technological lead. We also have a duty to promote American technological leadership.\n***\nA gap lies between our moment and the speed of transformation America experienced midcentury. Progress has slowed. Yes, large language models astonish us, rockets still turn our eyes upward, and satellites envelop the globe. But as we look forward to America’s 250th birthday celebration next year, our progress today pales in comparison to the huge leaps of the 20th century. Consider the country of fifty years ago.\nAs the nation approached its bicentennial, Americans looked forward to electricity too cheap to meter. By the end of 1972, 30 nuclear plants were operational, 55 were under construction, and more than 80 were planned or ordered. That same year, the Apollo 17 astronauts became the 11th and 12th men to walk on the moon. Five years before, the X-15 rocket plane had set a speed record for a crewed aircraft of Mach 6.7. America was flying higher, faster, and farther than ever before…\nToday, however, energy prices still burden producers and consumers alike, and the grid remains precarious. Over the past 30 years only three commercial nuclear reactors have been built and 10 have been closed. Despite spending almost twice as much on healthcare as peer nations, we have the lowest life expectancy. Apollo 17’s steps on the lunar surface have proved mankind’s last. The X-15’s record still stands, and the Concorde was decommissioned more than two decades ago. Our passenger planes are slower than they used to be. Our trains crawl compared to those in other parts of the world. Our cars do not fly\nAdvances have not stopped, but something has gone wrong.\n***\nStagnation was a choice. We have weighed down our builders and innovators. The well-intentioned regulatory regime of the 1970s became an ever-tightening ratchet, first hampering America’s ability to become a net-energy exporter and then making it harder and harder to build. We seem to have lost focus and vision, to have lowered our sights and let systems and structures and bureaucracies muddle us along.\nBut we are capable of so much more.\nOur technologies permit us to manipulate time and space. They leave distance annihilated, cause things to grow, and improve productivity.\nAs Vice President Vance said in a recent speech, the tradition of American innovation has been one of increasing the capacities of America’s workers, of extending human ability so that more people can do more, and, more meaningful work. But unrestricted immigration, and reliance on cheap labor both domestically and offshore, has been a substitute for improving productivity with technology.\nWe can build in new ways that let us do more with less, or we can borrow from the future. We have chosen to borrow from the future again and again. Our choice as a civilization is technology or debt. And we have chosen debt.\nToday we choose a better way.\n***\nOur first assignment is to secure America’s preeminence in critical and emerging technologies. This administration will ensure that our nation remains the leader in the industries of the future with a strategy of both promotion and protection—protecting our greatest assets and promoting our greatest innovators.\nTo the degree it even tried to accomplish this, the Biden administration failed on its own terms, led by a spirit of fear rather than promise. The old regime sought to protect its managerial power from the disruptions of technology, while promoting social division and redistribution in the name of equity. They secured American technology poorly, and failed to strengthen our leadership at all.\nPromoting America’s technological leadership requires three things of government. First, we have to make the smart choices of creatively allocating our public research and development dollars. Second, we have to make the right choices in constructing a common-sense, pro-innovation regulatory regime. And third, we have to make the easy choice to adopt the incredible products and tools made by American builders and to enable their export abroad.\nIn a moment of strategic significance, we must be more creative in our use of public research and development money, and shape a funding environment that makes clear what our national priorities are. Whether in AI, quantum, biotech, or next-generation semiconductors, in partnership with the private sector and academia, it is the duty of government to enable scientists to create new theories and empower engineers to put them into practice. Prizes, advance market commitments, and other novel funding mechanisms, like fast and flexible grants, can multiply the impact of government-funded research.\nAt a time defined by the desire to build in America again, we have to throw off the burden of bad regulations that weigh down our innovators, and use federal resources to test, to deploy, and to mature emerging technologies. We know, for example, the greatest obstacle to limitless energy in this country has been a regulatory regime opposed to innovation and development. This, too, has been the chief barrier to pushing the envelope again in transportation, whether supersonic aircraft or high-speed rail and flying cars. The time has come to review the rules on the books and to ask whom they really protect and what they really cost.\nFor a future stamped with the American character, the federal government must become an early adopter and avid promoter of American technology. Our innovators make incredible breakthroughs, but consumers, government included, require products that meet their needs, not just the wide-open country of frontier technology. Our industrial might, unleashed at home, and our technical achievements from AI to aerospace, successfully commercialized, can also be powerful instruments of diplomacy abroad and key components of our international alliances. American progress in critical technologies will make us the global partner of choice and the standards setter to follow if we enable and encourage American companies to distribute the American tech stack around the world.\n***\nThis approach to promoting America’s technological leadership goes hand in hand with a threefold strategy for protecting that position from foreign rivals. First, we must safeguard U.S. intellectual property and take seriously American research security. Second, we must prevent rival nations from infiltrating our infrastructure and supply chains, as well as from embedding themselves in the infrastructure of our allies. And third, we must enforce export controls and other measures that keep American frontier technologies out of competitors’ hands.\nWe face many dangers as a nation, but thanks to decades of feckless American leaders, China in particular has grown into both a geopolitical rival and technological competitor. This threat requires us to protect our science and technology resources with heightened vigilance, and defend the vital work American researchers do in public and corporate contexts alike from misuse, theft, and disruption. To safeguard our intellectual capital, we must restrict foreign access to sensitive data and strengthen oversight of international collaborators.\nOur infrastructure, supply chains, and those of our allies must be secured, too. We cannot afford to remain dependent, as we are in too many essential industries, on Chinese inputs and products, nor can we allow our closest partners to become points of insecurity by relying on Chinese-controlled critical infrastructure, whether in telecom, the grid, or AI. We must establish and secure trusted supply chains, implement public-private partnerships to enhance supply-chain resilience, and create investment incentives to reshore more critical manufacturing.\nFinally, after thirty years of subsidizing Chinese growth, it is time for us to stop helping a rival catch up with us in this race. Strict and simple export controls and know your customer rules, with an unapologetic America-first attitude about enforcing them, are central to stopping China from continuing to build itself up at our expense. We want peace between our countries, and that peace depends on keeping America’s bleeding-edge technology out of our competitor’s hands.\n***\nThe Golden Age of American innovation is on our horizon, if we choose it.\nIn a changing technological environment, the task ahead of us is to adapt to new realities without destroying the American way of life or dis-inheriting the American worker. We seek, in the most basic terms, to secure our economy, restore our middle class, and uphold America as the planet’s best home for innovators.\nFor many years now the temptation for the kinds of people represented in this room—builders and discoverers—has been to withdraw from politics. In the face of burdensome regulation and inefficient government and the circus of election cycles, many of you have chosen retreat of various kinds.\nBut there is no substitute for victory. You and your fellow Americans cannot afford to give up on the nation. In a world so shaped by politics as well as technology, we must take action in both of these domains. We need all Americans to continue to rise to the occasion, to make full use of their talents, and to build.\nAll of us must labor to preserve the inheritance of the American Century to share with posterity, and to ensure that the technologies that give shape to our world help the American people secure the blessings of liberty we received from our forebearers. I bear that responsibility in my role as the President’s Science and Technology Advisor. You bear it, too, in exercising whatever powers and responsibilities you have, whether in business, education, or the laboratory—as Americans.\nIt is the choices of individuals that will make the new American Golden Age possible: the choice of individuals to master the sclerosis of the state, and the choice of individuals to craft new technologies and give themselves to scientific discoveries that will bend time and space, make more with less, and drive us further into the endless frontier."

It didn’t taste bad.”\n- In 2017, PBS aired a panel devoted to what it “mean[s] to be woke” and “white privilege.”\n- In 2017, PBS produced an entire movie celebrating a transgender teenager’s so-called “changing gender identity.”\n- In 2015, NPR dedicated an entire segment to the “population of anthropomorphic animal enthusiasts known as ‘furries.’”\nNPR and PBS have zero tolerance for non-leftist viewpoints:\n- In 2020, NPR refused to cover the explosive Hunter Biden laptop scandal in the runup to the election, baselessly claiming there were “many, many red flags” and its “assertions don’t amount to much.”\n\nNPR wrote: “We don’t want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories, and we don’t want to waste the listeners’ and readers’ time on stories that are just pure distractions.”\n- NPR wrote: “We don’t want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories, and we don’t want to waste the listeners’ and readers’ time on stories that are just pure distractions.”\n- When a 25-year veteran NPR reporter and editor spoke out about the network’s refusal to report on the Hunter Biden laptop — and their obsession with liberal causes — they suspended him.\n\nThe editor found that registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans 87 to zero in their newsroom.\n\n\n\nNPR prolifically reported on the Russian collusion hoax, with the editor describing “[Adam] Schiff talking points” as “the drumbeat of NPR news reports.”\n\n\n\nNPR management asked its editors to avoid the term “biological sex” when discussing transgender issues.\n- The editor found that registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans 87 to zero in their newsroom.\n- NPR prolifically reported on the Russian collusion hoax, with the editor describing “[Adam] Schiff talking points” as “the drumbeat of NPR news reports.”\n- NPR management asked its editors to avoid the term “biological sex” when discussing transgender issues.\n- NPR CEO Katherine Maher once called President Trump “racist,” shared a photo of herself wearing a “Biden for President” campaign hat, serves on the board of a Soros-funded activist group, and described the “reverence for the truth” as a “distraction.”\n- In 2023, a study found that congressional Republicans saw 85% negative coverage while congressional Democrats saw 54% positive coverage on PBS’s flagship news program.\n- According to a 2024 study, PBS news staff used 162 variations of the term “far-right,” but only six variations of “far-left.”\n- Media bias rating agency AllBias — which surveyed nearly 24,000 readers — found NPR’s bias aligns with “liberal, progressive or left-wing thought and/or policy agendas.”\n- In 2010, NPR terminated journalist Juan Williams, who said it was because he was not a “predictable, black liberal.”\n- NPR repeatedly dismissed the theory that COVID-19 originated in a lab — a conclusion now deemed likely by the FBI, CIA, and Department of Energy.\n\nApril 2020: “Scientists Debunk Lab Accident Theory Of Pandemic Emergence”\n\n\n\nMay 2020: “As Trump Pushes Theory Of Virus Origins, Some See Parallels In Lead-Up To Iraq War”\n\n\n\nMay 2021: “Many Scientists Still Think The Coronavirus Came From Nature”\n\n\n\nMarch 2023: “Virologist says COVID origin report could make it harder to study dangerous diseases”\n\n\n\nSeptember 2024: “New research points to raccoon dogs in Wuhan market as pandemic trigger.

Trump has made U.S.-based chips manufacturing a priority as part of his relentless pursuit of an American manufacturing renaissance, and it’s paying off — with trillions of dollars in new investments secured in the tech sector alone.\nEarlier this year, President Trump announced a $500 billion private investment in AI infrastructure led by OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank, while Apple announced a $500 billion investment and TSMC announced a $100 billion investment in chips manufacturing.\nOnshoring these industries is good for the American worker, good for the American economy, and good for American national security — and the best is yet to come.\n"

    "content": "This morning, the Trump Administration’s top officials took to the Sunday shows to discuss the state of President Donald J. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, how negotiations are progressing, and the results they’ve already delivered on behalf of American workers and businesses.\nHere’s what you missed:\n- On tariffs for certain electronics: “Those products are going to be part of the semiconductor sectoral tariffs, which are coming … We need to have these things made in America.”\n- On the constitutionality of tariffs: “Congress has passed laws that gave the president the ability to protect our national security … If we just run gigantic trade deficits and sell our soul to the rest of the world, eventually we are going to be the worker for the rest of the world.”\n- On expanding market access: “Our farmers are finally going to have access to the world’s markets. Our farmers have never had the opportunity to sell corn in India — so what’s going to happen is as they sell more and more products, prices will come down.”\n- On tariffs negotiations: “This is unfolding exactly like we thought it would … We have a strategy here where the President says we’re going to charge them what they charge us … knowing full well that a lot of countries would come right to us and want to bargain.”\n- On semiconductor tariffs: “The policy is no exemptions, no exclusions … What the Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, is going to do — and he’s doing it as we speak — is an investigation of the chips supply chain. The goal is stability and resilience.”\n- On inflation: “We had really good news on the inflation front — both the Producer Price Index, which is your wholesale prices, and Consumer Price Index had the lowest print since fall of 2023.”\n- On China: “In the 15 years after China entered the WTO, real wages went down — so wages went down by more than prices as we thought these cheap goods were going to revolutionize America. In fact, it was the opposite.”\n- On trade deal negotiations: “My goal is to get meaningful deals before 90 days — and I think we’re going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.”\n- On the response to reciprocal tariffs: “President Trump has a global program to try to reshore American manufacturing and address the trade deficit. It’s a global issue. The only reason we’re really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate.”\n- On tariffs exemptions: “For the national security tariffs, you have to do an investigation in order to impose the tariffs … That’s why they don’t have a tariff covered right now because you have to go through the investigation … We expect there will have to be some kind of tariff.”\n- On trade: “For decades, the way we have been treated in this country and especially our farmers and ranchers is absolutely stunning. We have been living under a tariff regime but it has been the regime of other countries … The President is working to fix it.”\n- On ethanol production: “Ethanol is a very important part of our energy independence strategy. President Trump has been unequivocal in his support for ethanol.”\n- On the Panama Canal: “What President Trump said in his State of the Union address is that China has too much influence over the Panama Canal and America’s going to take it back — and that’s exactly what I was charged to do … Chinese influence cannot control our own backyard.”\n- On Iran: “[President Trump is] dead serious that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon … He’s also dead serious that if we can’t figure this out at the negotiating table, then there are other options.”\n- On tariffs: “When the President issued his reciprocal tariffs, our government at the time specifically said that chips and semiconductors, which are critical components of our national security, were going to be dealt with through a separate Commerce authority known as a 232. That was always the plan because those components are so essential to our national security. We need to have a separate process for dealing with how to reshore those essential industries … There are no exemptions.”\n- On President Trump’s historic actions: “History will record that the actions President Trump has taken in recent days were the beginning of saving the West from complete economic domination by another power.”"

This week is a time of reflection for Christians to memorialize Jesus’ crucifixion—and to prepare their hearts, minds, and souls for His miraculous Resurrection from the dead.\nDuring this sacred week, we acknowledge that the glory of Easter Sunday cannot come without the sacrifice Jesus Christ made on the cross.  In His final hours on Earth, Christ willingly endured excruciating pain, torture, and execution on the cross out of a deep and abiding love for all His creation.  Through His suffering, we have redemption.  Through His death, we are forgiven of our sins.  Through His Resurrection, we have hope of eternal life.  On Easter morning, the stone is rolled away, the tomb is empty, and light prevails over darkness—signaling that death does not have the final word.\nThis Holy Week, my Administration renews its promise to defend the Christian faith in our schools, military, workplaces, hospitals, and halls of government.  We will never waver in safeguarding the right to religious liberty, upholding the dignity of life, and protecting God in our public square.\nAs we focus on Christ’s redeeming sacrifice, we look to His love, humility, and obedience—even in life’s most difficult and uncertain moments.  This week, we pray for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon our beloved Nation.  We pray that America will remain a beacon of faith, hope, and freedom for the entire world, and we pray to achieve a future that reflects the truth, beauty, and goodness of Christ’s eternal kingdom in Heaven.\nMay God bless you and your family during this special time of year and may He continue to bless the United States of America."

    "content": "It’s cliché, yet true — the definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over and expecting a different result.The trade policies of the past several decades have failed this nation, its workers, and our communities.Twenty years ago, The New York Times Editorial Board responded to the January 2005 trade deficit of $58.3 billion by writing an editorial entitled “Dangerous deficits.” Deficits are certainly dangerous; former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said trade deficits were to blame for the Great Recession.The Times wrote in 2005: “At $58.3 billion, the U.S. trade deficit for January exceeded everyone’s worst expectations… The trade deficit is the single most important factor in measuring the extent to which the United States lives beyond its means.”Since then, our trade deficit has more than DOUBLED. The U.S. trade deficit in January totaled a whopping $131.4 billion.The impact has been seen everywhere.Since 1990, manufacturing employment has decreased by 59% in New York and decreased by 35% in Ohio.The loss of these jobs killed innocent Americans and destroyed towns. Multiple studies show the loss of jobs due to bad trade deals led to an increase in drug overdoses.However, liberal commentators have lost interest in fixing this problem. In fact, they are offended at the suggestion that industry should return to America.Chris Matthews was inexplicably stunned on MSNBC and asked, “What are we going to do? Have more lumber made in the United States now!?” Yes, we are. President Donald J. Trump even signed an executive order to expand American timber production.Likewise, Nia Malika-Henderson on CNN ridiculously asked, “Is it worth it to upend the global economy for HVAC jobs?” Apparently, Nia Malika-Henderson thinks preserving low-wage jobs in China is more important than creating high-wage jobs in America.The loss of American industry means we struggle to build ships, medicine, and other essential goods. This is a national security emergency.Fortunately, we are already seeing progress in reshoring American industry.

    "content": "After today’s inflation report showed the first consumer price decline in years, a decrease in energy prices, and real average hourly wage growth, one thing is clear: President Donald J. Trump’s economic agenda is delivering for Americans.Here’s what they’re saying:Council of Economic Advisers Chair Stephen Miran: “That core inflation print, on an annual basis, was the lowest core inflation print since March of 2021, so President Trump’s policies are working at keeping inflation at bay, keeping inflation down. Between that and what’s going on with trade — America is back.”Economist E.J. Antoni, Ph.D.: “This is truly remarkable: Average annual inflation rate from ‘09 until ‘21 was 1.8%, then Biden drove it up to 8.6% for a year and a half, then it rose steadily at 3.1% for the rest of his term; but now Trump is averaging a mere 1.0% -remarkable!”CNBC’s Rick Santelli: “We were expecting the exact opposite … These are definitely low numbers!”CNN’s Matt Egan: “This was actually a drop of .1% — that’s the first time we’ve seen that since COVID. Year-over-year, the annual inflation rate was at 2.4%. This was also better than expected and a 6-month low, moving in the right direction.”USA Today: “Inflation eased more than expected to a five-month low in March as gasoline and used car prices tumbled and rent increases softened further…”Axios: “Inflation was notably cooler than expected in March: The overall Consumer Price Index dropped as energy prices plummeted, while the core measure that excludes food and energy rose just slightly.”Bloomberg: “Inflation came in notably weaker than expected for last month, with the headline CPI falling 0.1% — thanks in part to a tumble in gasoline prices. None of the 67 forecasters in Bloomberg’s survey had predicted a drop.”CNN: “Inflation slowed sharply in March, new data showed Thursday, underscoring the continued strength and resilience of the economy ahead of President Trump’s aggressive trade moves.”Associated Press: “U.S. inflation declined last month as the cost of gas, airline fares, and hotel rooms fell, a sign that price growth was cooling even as President Donald Trump ramped up his tariff threats.”The Wall Street Journal: “Consumer prices declined month-over-month in March for the first time in nearly five years, a welcome development for inflation-weary consumers…”Breitbart: “U.S. consumer prices fell in March, pushed down by a decline in the price of goods and defying predictions that President Trump’s tariff plans would push up prices. This was the first drop in consumer prices in nearly three years and only the second decline since inflation accelerated under Joe Biden to the worst rates in decades.”The Washington Post: “Inflation cooled significantly in March amid a drop in energy and transportation prices, giving consumers a bit of a break”The Daily Caller: “Trump Notches Win As Inflation Eases More Than Expected In March”NBC News: “The pace of price hikes for airfare, car insurance, used vehicles and recreation all eased in March.”CBS News: “Consumer price growth cooled in March as the White House prepared far-reaching global tariffs, with a key inflation measure falling to its lowest level since March 2021 … On a monthly basis, prices actually fell 0.1% in March, the first monthly drop in nearly five years.”CNBC: “Consumer price inflation eased more than expected in March as President Donald Trump prepared to launch tariffs against U.S. trading partners”Reuters: “US consumer prices post first decline in nearly five years”Barron’s: “Inflation Cools More Than Expected”"

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:\nSection. 1.  Background.  In Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices that Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I declared a national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, and imposed additional ad valorem duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate to deal with that unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security and economy of the United States.  Section 4(b) of Executive Order 14257 provided that “[s]hould any trading partner retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on U.S. exports or other measures, I may further modify the [Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States] to increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.”\nIn the Executive Order dated April 8, 2025 (Amendment to Reciprocal Tariffs and Updated Duties As Applied to Low-Value Imports from the People’s Republic of China), pursuant to section 4(b) of Executive Order 14257, I ordered modification of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) to raise the applicable ad valorem duty rate for imports from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) established in Executive Order 14257, in recognition of the fact that the PRC announced that it would retaliate against the United States in response to Executive Order 14257.\nOn April 9, 2025, the State Council Tariff Commission of the PRC announced that, in response to the Executive Order dated April 8, 2025, an 84 percent tariff would be imposed on all goods imported into the PRC originating from the United States, effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 10, 2025.  Pursuant to section 4(b) of Executive Order 14257, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in that order by modifying the HTSUS and taking other actions to increase the duties imposed on the PRC in response to this latest retaliation.  In my judgment, this modification is necessary and appropriate to effectively address the threat to U.S. national and economic security posed by the PRC’s contribution to the conditions reflected in large and persistent trade deficits, including PRC industrial policies that have produced systemic excess manufacturing capacity in the PRC and suppressed U.S. domestic manufacturing capacity, which conditions are made worse by the PRC’s recent actions.\nSection 4(c) of Executive Order 14257 provided that, “[s]hould any trading partner take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters, I may further modify the HTSUS to decrease or limit in scope the duties imposed under this order.”  Since I signed Executive Order 14257, in contrast to the PRC’s actions, more than 75 other foreign trading partners, including countries enumerated in Annex I to Executive Order 14257, have approached the United States to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationships and our resulting national and economic security concerns.  This is a significant step by these countries toward remedying non-reciprocal trade arrangements and aligning sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters.\nPursuant to section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in that order by modifying the HTSUS to temporarily suspend, for a period of 90 days, except with respect to the PRC, application of the individual ad valorem duties imposed for foreign trading partners listed in Annex I to Executive Order 14257, and to instead impose on articles of all such trading partners an additional ad valorem rate of duty as set forth herein, pursuant to the terms of, and except as otherwise provided in, Executive Order 14257, as modified by this order.\nSec. 2. Suspension of Country-Specific Ad Valorem Rates of Duty.  Effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 10, 2025, enforcement of the second paragraph of section 3(a) of Executive Order 14257 is suspended until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on July 9, 2025.  Effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 10, 2025, and until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on July 9, 2025, all articles imported into the customs territory of the United States from the trading partners enumerated in Annex I to Executive Order 14257 shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10 percent, subject to all applicable exceptions set forth in Executive Order 14257.\nSec. 3.  Tariff Modifications.  In recognition of the fact that the PRC has announced that it will retaliate again against the United States in response to the Executive Order dated April 8, 2025, which amended Executive Order 14257, and in recognition of the sincere intentions by many other trading partners to facilitate a resolution to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, the HTSUS shall be modified as follows:\nEffective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 10, 2025:\n(a)  heading 9903.01.25 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting the article description and by inserting “Articles the product of any country, except for products described in headings 9903.01.26-9903.01.33, and except as provided for in heading 9903.01.34, and except for articles the product of China, including Hong Kong and Macau, as described in heading 9903.01.63 that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 10, 2025, and that were not in transit on the final mode of transit prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 10, 2025, as provided for in subdivision (v) of U.S. note 2 to this subchapter . . . . . . .” in lieu thereof;\n(b) heading 9903.01.63 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting “84%” each place that it appears and by inserting “125%” in lieu thereof, and by deleting “April 9, 2025,” and by inserting “April 10, 2025” in lieu thereof;\n(c) subdivision (v)(xiii)(10) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting “84%”, and inserting “125%” in lieu thereof, and subdivision (v)(xiii) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting “April 9, 2025,” and by inserting “April 10, 2025,” in lieu thereof; and\n(d) headings 9903.01.43-9903.01.62 and 9903.01.64-9903.01.76 are hereby suspended, and subdivisions (v)(xiii)(i)-(ix) and (xi)-(lvii) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS are hereby suspended for a period of 90 days beginning at 12:01 a.m. on April 10, 2025.\nSec. 4. De Minimis Tariff Increase.  To ensure that the imposition of tariffs pursuant to section 3 of this order is not circumvented and that the purpose of Executive Order 14257, as modified by the Executive Order dated April 8, 2025, and this order are not undermined, I also deem it necessary and appropriate to:\n(a)  increase the ad valorem rate of duty set forth in section 2(c)(i) of Executive Order 14256 of April 2, 2025 (Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China as Applied to Low-Value Imports), as modified by the Executive Order dated April 8, 2025, from 90 percent to 120 percent;\n(b)  increase the per postal item containing goods duty in section 2(c)(ii) of Executive Order 14256, as modified by the Executive Order dated April 8, 2025, that is in effect on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025, and before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025, from 75 dollars to 100 dollars; and\n(c)  increase the per postal item containing goods duty in section 2(c)(ii) of Executive Order 14256, as modified by the Executive Order dated April 8, 2025, that is in effect on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025, from 150 dollars to 200 dollars.\nSec. 5.

    "content": "TO: WHITE HOUSE COMMS STAFFFROM: CEA STAFFSUBJECT: President Trump’s Actions Will Save Nearly $11,000 Per Family of Four Over the Coming Years President Donald J. Trump has taken major steps to reduce the size of the administrative state and reduce the volume of regulations impacting American households and businesses. The administration expects major cost savings from the President’s aggressive deregulatory agenda as firms respond to the improved business environment over the next several years. Upon taking office, President Trump immediately blocked all unfinalized Biden era rules, saving Americans over $180 billion — $2,100 per family of four — and launched a bold, multi-agency effort to roll back existing federal regulations that drive up the cost of living. This effort is projected to yield significant cost savings in the coming months, including the EPA’s rollback of tailpipe emission rules for light-duty and medium-duty vehicles ($667 billion in total savings) and the Department of Transportation’s latest Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards ($88 billion in savings). These two efforts alone yield $755 billion in total savings or over $8,800 per family of four. The combined savings from all of these actions equal just over $935 billion or nearly $11,000 per family of four over the coming years.The Trump Administration has implemented an aggressive 10-to-1 deregulatory initiative, which requires that whenever an agency proposes a new rule or guidance document, it must eliminate 10 existing rules or guidance documents. This effort builds on the successful deregulatory initiative introduced in President Trump’s first term, which required the repeal of at least two existing regulations for each new rule, and in practice eliminated 5.5 rules for each new significant rule.President Trump has already issued more than a dozen presidential actions mandating a wide range of deregulatory relief, including:\n- The recission of burdensome executive orders and proposed regulations.\n- The ending of Federal DEI programs and preferencing.\n- The elimination of regulatory hurdles to greater energy production and natural resource extraction.\n- The targeted elimination of regulations to reduce the cost of housing, healthcare, consumer appliances, food, and energy.\n- The removal of barriers to American leadership in artificial intelligence.\n- The elimination of rules thwarting innovation in digital assets and financial technology.\n- The removal of regulatory obstacles to significant foreign investments in the U.S.\nEmergency measures to reduce regulatory burdens stifling California’s access to water resources."

    "content": "MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES  Miles Taylor was entrusted with the solemn responsibility of Federal service, but instead prioritized his own ambition, personal notoriety, and monetary gain over fidelity to his constitutional oath.  While serving as an administrative staff assistant at the Department of Homeland Security, Taylor stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed “resistance” within the Federal Government that “vowed” to undermine and render ineffective a sitting President.  He illegally published classified conversations to sell his book under the pseudonym “Anonymous,” which is full of falsehoods and fabricated stories.  In so doing, Taylor abandoned his sacred oath and commitment to public service by disclosing sensitive information obtained through unauthorized methods and betrayed the confidence of those with whom he served.  Where a Government employee improperly discloses sensitive information for the purposes of personal enrichment and undermining our foreign policy, national security, and Government effectiveness –- all ultimately designed to sow chaos and distrust in Government — this conduct could properly be characterized as treasonous and as possibly violating the Espionage Act, and therefore makes such employee ineligible for access to national secrets. In his former position, Taylor relied upon various colleagues to facilitate his unethical laundering and release of sensitive Government data to advance his false narratives.  It is therefore against America’s interests to allow those associated with Taylor to access our Nation’s secrets.  Accordingly, I direct the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant executive department and agency (agency) heads to immediately take all action as necessary and consistent with existing law to suspend any active security clearances held by Miles Taylor, in addition to individuals at entities associated with Taylor, including the University of Pennsylvania, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.I further direct the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with any other relevant agency heads, to take all appropriate action to review Miles Taylor’s activities as a Government employee.  This review should identify any instances where his conduct appears to have been contrary to suitability standards for Federal employees, and where his conduct appears to have involved the unauthorized dissemination of classified information.  Upon completing this review, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall prepare a report to be submitted to the President, through the Counsel to the President, with recommendations for appropriate remedial or preventative actions to be taken to protect America’s interests.

    "content": "MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES\nThe Federal Government has a constitutional duty and a moral responsibility to respect and promote the free speech rights of Americans. Yet in recent years, elitist leaders in Government have unlawfully censored speech and weaponized their undeserved influence to silence perceived political opponents and advance their preferred, and often erroneous, narrative about significant matters of public debate. These disgraceful actions have taken the form of coercive threats against the private sector — including major social media platforms — to suppress conservative or dissenting voices and distort public opinion. Much of this censorship took place during a Presidential election with the apparent purpose of undermining the free exchange of ideas and debate.\nChristopher Krebs, the former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), is a significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his Government authority. Krebs’ misconduct involved the censorship of disfavored speech implicating the 2020 election and COVID-19 pandemic. CISA, under Krebs’ leadership, suppressed conservative viewpoints under the guise of combatting supposed disinformation, and recruited and coerced major social media platforms to further its partisan mission. CISA covertly worked to blind the American public to the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden’s laptop. Krebs, through CISA, promoted the censorship of election information, including known risks associated with certain voting practices. Similarly, Krebs, through CISA, falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines. Krebs skewed the bona fide debate about COVID-19 by attempting to discredit widely shared views that ran contrary to CISA’s favored perspective.\nAbusive conduct of this sort both violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself. Those who engage in or support such conduct must not have continued access to our Nation’s secrets. Accordingly, I hereby direct the heads of executive department and agencies (agencies) to immediately take steps consistent with existing law to revoke any active security clearance held by Christopher Krebs.\nI further direct the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant agencies to immediately take all action as necessary and consistent with existing law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at entities associated with Krebs, including SentinelOne, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.\nI further direct the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with any other agency head, to take all appropriate action to review Krebs’ activities as a Government employee, including his leadership of CISA. This review should identify any instances where Krebs’ conduct appears to have been contrary to suitability standards for Federal employees, involved the unauthorized dissemination of classified information, or contrary to the purposes and policies identified in Executive Order 14149 of January 20, 2025 (Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship). As part of that review, I direct a comprehensive evaluation of all of CISA’s activities over the last 6 years, focusing specifically on any instances where CISA’s conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies identified in Executive Order 14149. Upon completing these reviews, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall prepare a joint report to be submitted to the President, through the Counsel to the President, with recommendations for appropriate remedial or preventative actions to be taken to fulfill the purposes and policies of Executive Order 14149.\nThis memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n"

effort.  Similarly, the defense acquisition workforce is a national strategic asset that will be decisive in any conflict, where the factory floor can be just as significant as the battlefield.Unfortunately, after years of misplaced priorities and poor management, our defense acquisition system does not provide the speed and flexibility our Armed Forces need to have decisive advantages in the future.  In order to strengthen our military edge, America must deliver state‐of‐the‐art capabilities at speed and scale through a comprehensive overhaul of this system.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States Government to accelerate defense procurement and revitalize the defense industrial base to restore peace through strength.  To achieve this, the United States will rapidly reform our antiquated defense acquisition processes with an emphasis on speed, flexibility, and execution.  We will also modernize the duties and composition of the defense acquisition workforce, as well as incentivize and reward risk-taking and innovation from these personnel.\nSec. 3.  Acquisition Process Reform.  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the President a plan to reform the Department of Defense’s acquisition processes that, to the maximum extent possible, incorporates the following:(a)  Utilization of

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  The commercial shipbuilding capacity and maritime workforce of the United States has been weakened by decades of Government neglect, leading to the decline of a once strong industrial base while simultaneously empowering our adversaries and eroding United States national security.  Both our allies and our strategic competitors produce ships for a fraction of the cost needed in the United States.  Recent data shows that the United States constructs less than one percent of commercial ships globally, while the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is responsible for producing approximately half.Rectifying these issues requires a comprehensive approach that includes securing consistent, predictable, and durable Federal funding, making United States-flagged and built vessels commercially competitive in international commerce, rebuilding America’s maritime manufacturing capabilities (the Maritime Industrial Base), and expanding and strengthening the recruitment, training, and retention of the relevant workforce.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to revitalize and rebuild domestic maritime industries and workforce to promote national security and economic prosperity.\nSec. 3.  Maritime Action Plan.  (a)  Within 210 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative (USTR), and the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) the APNSA deems appropriate, shall submit a Maritime Action Plan (MAP) to the President, through the APNSA and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) to achieve the policy set forth in this order.(b)  The OMB Director, in coordination with the APNSA, shall be responsible for all legislative, regulatory, and fiscal assessments related to the MAP.  (c)  The MAP shall, to the extent permissible and consistent with applicable law, including the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 8301–8305), reflect actions taken pursuant to sections 4 through 21 of this order.\nSec. 4.  Ensure the Security and Resilience of the Maritime Industrial Base.  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall provide to the APNSA and the OMB Director for inclusion in the MAP an assessment of options both for the use of available authorities and resources, such as Defense Production Act Title III authorities, and for the use of private capital to the maximum extent possible to invest in and expand the Maritime Industrial Base including, but not limited to, investment and expansion of commercial and defense shipbuilding capabilities, component supply chains, ship repair and marine transportation capabilities, port infrastructure, and the adjacent workforce.  The Secretary of Defense shall pursue using the Office of Strategic Capital loan program to improve the shipbuilding industrial base.  As part of their assessment, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall:(a)  identify key maritime components in the supply chain that are essential for rebuilding and expanding the Maritime Industrial Base and that should be prioritized for investment;(b)  ensure that their recommendations of public and private investments are made according to a clear metric, derived in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, of return on invested capital for the United States taxpayer and to the economic and national security of the United States; and(c)  ensure that their recommendations take into consideration the projected increases to commercial and defense capabilities, the projected growth in economic activity, and the projected benefits for taxpayers and the workforce.\nSec. 5. Actions in the Investigation of the PRC’s Unfair Targeting of Maritime, Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors. (a)  With respect to the actions, if any, that the USTR determines to take consistent with the USTR’s notice of public hearing entitled Proposed Action in Section 301 Investigation of the PRC’s Targeting of the Maritime, Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors for Dominance, 90 Fed. Reg. 10843 (February 27, 2025), the USTR shall:(i)   coordinate with appropriate agencies to collect additional information, as appropriate and to the extent permitted by law, in support of administering such actions; and (ii)  coordinate with the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate steps to enforce any restriction, fee, penalty, or duty imposed pursuant to such actions.(b)  Based on the USTR’s determinations arising out of its Section 301 investigation into the PRC’s targeting of the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors, the USTR shall also consider taking all necessary steps permitted by law to propose the following actions:(i)   tariffs on ship-to-shore cranes manufactured, assembled, or made using components of PRC origin, or manufactured anywhere in the world by a company owned, controlled, or substantially influenced by a PRC national; and(ii)  tariffs on other cargo handling equipment.\nSec. 6.  Enforce Collection of Harbor Maintenance Fee and Other Charges.  In order to prevent cargo carriers from circumventing the Harbor Maintenance Fee (HMF) on imported goods through the practice of making port in Canada or Mexico and sending their cargo into the United States through land borders, and to ensure the collection of other charges as applicable, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all necessary steps, including proposing new legislation, as permitted by law to:(a)  require all foreign-origin cargo arriving by vessel to clear the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) entry process at a United States port of entry for security and collection of all applicable duties, customs, taxes, fees, interest, and other charges; and(b)  ensure any foreign-origin cargo first arriving by vessel to North America clearing the CBP process at an inland location from the country of land transit (Canada or Mexico) is assessed applicable customs, duties, taxes, fees (including the HMF), interest, and other charges plus a 10 percent service fee for additional costs to the CBP, so long as the cargo being shipped into the United States is not substantially transformed from its condition at the time of arrival into the country of land transit (with the discretion for such decisions to be determined by CBP).\nSec. 7.  Engage Allies and Partners to Align Trade Policies.  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the USTR, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce, shall engage treaty allies, partners, and other like-minded countries around the world with respect to their potential imposition of any actions taken pursuant to sections 5 and 6 of this order.  The USTR shall deliver an engagement plan and progress report on these engagements to the President.\nSec. 8.  Reduce Dependence on Adversaries through Allies and Partners.  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall recommend to the APNSA and the OMB Director for inclusion in the MAP all available incentives to help shipbuilders domiciled in allied nations partner to undertake capital investment in the United States to help strengthen the shipbuilding capacity of the United States.\nSec. 9.  Launch a Maritime Security Trust Fund.  In conjunction with the formulation of the President’s Budget, the OMB Director shall, in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation, develop a legislative proposal, which shall be described in detail in the MAP, to establish a Maritime Security Trust Fund that can serve as a reliable funding source to deliver consistent support for MAP programs.  This proposal shall consider how new or existing tariff revenue, fines, fees, or tax revenue could further the goal of establishing a more reliable, dedicated funding source for programs support by the MAP.\nSec. 10.  Shipbuilding Financial Incentives Program.  In conjunction with the formulation of the President’s Budget and consistent with the findings of the report required under section 12 of this order, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit a legislative proposal to the APNSA and the OMB Director, which shall be described in detail in the MAP, that establishes a financial incentives program with broad flexibility to incentivize private investment in the construction of commercial components, parts, and vessels;

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  In our country, laws are supposed to provide the certainty and order necessary to foster liberty and innovation.  Instead, our vast regulatory structure often serves to constrict ordered liberty, not promote it.  The United States Code itself is more than 60,000 pages.  But unelected agency officials write most of the complex, legally binding rules on top of that, often stretching these statutory provisions beyond what the Congress enacted.\nIn particular, the previous administration added more pages to the Federal Register than any other in history, with the result that the Code of Federal Regulations now approaches a staggering 200,000 pages.  These regulations linger in such volume that serious reexamination seldom occurs.This regime of governance-by-regulator has imposed particularly severe costs on energy production, where innovation is critical.  The net result is an energy landscape perpetually trapped in the 1970s.  By rescinding outdated regulations that serve as a drag on progress, we can stimulate innovation and deliver prosperity to everyday Americans.\nThis order directs certain agencies to incorporate a sunset provision into their regulations governing energy production to the extent permitted by law, thus compelling those agencies to reexamine their regulations periodically to ensure that those rules serve the public good.\nSec. 2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this order:(a)  “Conditional Sunset Date” means the date a regulation will cease to be effective and be removed from the Code of Federal Regulations, if the agency does not extend the Sunset Date pursuant to section 4(d) of this order.(b)  “Covered Agency” means one of the agencies listed in section 3(a) of this order.(c)  “Covered Regulation” means a regulation issued in whole or in part pursuant to a statutory authority listed in sections 3(b)-(j) of this order. (d)  “DOGE Team Lead” means the leader of the DOGE Team at each agency as described in Executive Order 14158.(e)  “Regulation” means each part, subpart, or individual provision of the Code of Federal Regulations promulgated under an agency rule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(4).\nSec. 3.  Covered Agencies and Regulations.  (a)  This order applies to the following agencies and their subcomponents:  the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); the Department of Energy (DoE); the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC); and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  It further applies to the following agency subcomponents:  the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), all within the Department of the Interior; and the United States Army Corps of Engineers (ACE), within the United States Army.(b)  For the DoE, this order applies to all regulations issued pursuant to the following statutes and any amendments thereto:(i)    the Atomic Energy Act of 1954;(ii)   the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987;(iii)  the Energy Policy Act of 1992;(iv)   the Energy Policy Act of 2005; and(v)    the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.(c)  For FERC, this order applies to all regulations issued pursuant to the following statutes and any amendments thereto:(i)    the Federal Power Act of 1935; (ii)   the Natural Gas Act of 1938; and(iii)  the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978.(d)  For the NRC, this order applies to all regulations issued pursuant to the following statutes and any amendments thereto:(i)    the Atomic Energy Act of 1954;(ii)   the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974; and(iii)  the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.(e)  For the OSMRE, this order applies to all regulations issued pursuant to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 and any amendments thereto.(f)  For the BLM, this order applies to all regulations issued pursuant to the following statutes and any amendments thereto:(i)    the Mining Act of 1872; (ii)   the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976; and (iii)  the Energy Policy Act of 2005.(g)  For the BOEM, this order applies to all regulations issued pursuant to the following statutes and any amendments thereto:(i)   the Outer Continental Shelf Act of 1953; and(ii)  the Energy Policy Act of 2005.(h)  For the BSEE, this order applies to all regulations issued pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Act of 1953 and any amendments thereto.(i)  For the FWS, this order applies to all regulations issued pursuant to the following statutes and any amendments thereto:(i)     the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act;(ii)    the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918;(iii)   the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1934;(iv)    the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act of 1965;    (v)     the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972;(vi)    the Endangered Species Act of 1973;(vii)   the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976; and(viii)  the Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982.(j)  For the EPA and ACE, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA and Secretary of the Army shall provide to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director), a list of statutes vesting EPA and ACE with regulatory authority that shall be subject to this order.\nSec. 4.  Zero-Based Regulating.  (a)  To the extent consistent with applicable law, each of the Covered Agencies shall issue a sunset rule, effective not later than September 30, 2025, that inserts a Conditional Sunset Date into each of their Covered Regulations.(b)  The sunset rule shall provide that each Covered Regulation in effect on the date of this order shall have a Conditional Sunset Date of 1 year after the effective date of the sunset rule, subject to the process set forth in subsection (d) of this section.  Unless the extension condition specified in subsection (d) of this section is satisfied, agencies will treat Covered Regulations as ceasing to be effective on that date for all purposes.  An agency shall not take any action to enforce such an ineffective regulation and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, shall remove it from the Code of Federal Regulations. (c)  In any new Covered Regulation, to the maximum extent consistent with law, the relevant Covered Agency shall include a Conditional Sunset Date that is not more than 5 years in the future.  Amendments to any Covered Regulation shall provide that they do not reset that regulation’s Conditional Sunset Date and shall be subject to the same Conditional Sunset Date as the amended regulation.  The OMB Director may exempt a new regulation or amendment from the requirements of this paragraph if he determines that the new regulation or amendment has a net deregulatory effect.(d)  The sunset provision added to existing and new Covered Regulations shall provide that the agency will offer the public an opportunity to comment on the costs and benefits of each regulation, such as through a request for information, prior to a rule’s expiration, and following such opportunity the Conditional Sunset Date for that Covered Regulation may be extended if the agency finds an extension is warranted.  A request for information shall not automatically extend the Conditional Sunset Date.  A Covered Agency may extend the Conditional Sunset Date for a particular Covered Regulation as many times as is appropriate, but never to a date more than 5 years in the future.\nSec. 5.  Implementation.  (a)  Neither a determination to extend the Conditional Sunset Date of a particular regulation, nor a regulation that expires as a result this order, shall count towards the ten-for-one regulatory requirement in Executive Order 14192 of January 31, 2025 (Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation).(b)  Agency heads shall coordinate with their DOGE Team Leads and the Office of Management and Budget to implement this order.(c)  This order shall not apply to regulatory permitting regimes authorized by statute.\nSec. 6.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any agency, person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other agencies, persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nSec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii)  the functions of the OMB Director relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,    April 9, 2025."

and(C)  ensure the transfer of priority end-items to priority partners would advance my Administration’s goal of strengthening allied burden-sharing, both by sharing the cost of end-item production and by increasing our allies’ capacity to meet capability targets independently, without sustained support from the United States.(c)(i)  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense shall review, update, and reissue the lists of priority partners and military end-items on an annual basis.the United States Munitions List, 22 C.F.R. part 121, to focus protections solely on our most sensitive and sophisticated technologies, and shall establish clear criteria for including an item on the FMS-Only List.(ii) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense shall review and update the list of defense items that can only be purchased through the FMS process (the FMS-Only List) and(d)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall submit a plan to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), to:  improve the transparency of United States defense sales to foreign partners by developing metrics for accountability; secure exportability as a requirement in the early stages of the acquisition process; and consolidate technology security and foreign disclosure approvals.(e)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, with the assistance of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce, shall submit a plan to the APNSA to develop a single electronic system to track all DCS export license requests and ongoing FMS efforts throughout the case life-cycle.\nSec. 4.  Definitions.  For purposes of this order:\n(a)  “Parallel decision-making” refers to the granting of simultaneous certifications and approvals during the FMS process, as opposed to sequential decision-making where agencies wait for other agencies to make decisions before taking action.(b)  “Exportability” means the process to identify, develop, and integrate technology protection features into United States defense systems early in the acquisition process to protect critical technologies, capabilities, and program information and thus enable export to partners.(c)  “FMS-only” means defense articles that are exclusively available through the FMS process as opposed to the DCS process, as authorized in the Arms Export Control Act and described in the Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM), Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), Chapter 4.(d)  “End-item” means the final product when assembled and ready for issue or deployment.(e)  “Foreign defense sales system” means the enterprise devoted to the transfer of defense articles, services, and training by the United States Government and United States companies to international partners and organizations.(f)  All other terms related to FMS cases shall have the meanings given to them by the SAMM, DSCA 5105.38M.Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.       THE WHITE HOUSE,    April 9, 2025."

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2025, as “Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A.”  I call upon all government officials, educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand thisninth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth."

The Oxford English Dictionary, by contrast, defines “showerhead” in one short sentence.\n- President Trump is restoring sanity to at least one small part of the federal regulations, returning to the straightforward meaning of “showerhead” from the 1992 energy law, which sets a simple 2.5-gallons-per-minute standard for showers.\n- The Order frees Americans from excessive regulations that turned a basic household item into a bureaucratic nightmare. No longer will showerheads be weak and worthless.\nROLLING BACK OVERREGULATION: Overregulation chokes the American economy, entrenches bureaucrats, and stifles personal freedom.\n- Under Obama and Biden, the government issued lengthy rules—thousands of words long—redefining “showerhead” as a “nozzle” and making multi-nozzle showers illegal if they collectively discharged over 2.5 gallons of water per minute.These changes served a radical green agenda that made life worse for everyday Americans.President Trump sought to undo this definition in his first term by publishing extensive analysis and a formal rule—however, Biden undid this progress and the shower wars continued. The government should not waste taxpayer time and money writing another elaborate definition for a term that has a simple definition.\n\nNo market failure justifies this intrusion: Americans pay for their own water and should be free to choose their showerheads without federal meddling.\n- These changes served a radical green agenda that made life worse for everyday Americans.\n- President Trump sought to undo this definition in his first term by publishing extensive analysis and a formal rule—however, Biden undid this progress and the shower wars continued.\n- The government should not waste taxpayer time and money writing another elaborate definition for a term that has a simple definition.\n- No market failure justifies this intrusion: Americans pay for their own water and should be free to choose their showerheads without federal meddling.\n- It’s not just showers—the Biden Administration aggressively targeted everyday appliances like gas stoves, water heaters, washing machines, furnaces, dishwashers, and more, waging war on the reliable tools Americans depend on daily.These appliances worked perfectly fine before Biden’s meddling piled on convoluted regulations that made those appliances worse. \n\nPresident Trump is slashing red tape and ending Biden’s dumb war on things that work.\n- These appliances worked perfectly fine before Biden’s meddling piled on convoluted regulations that made those appliances worse.\n- President Trump is slashing red tape and ending Biden’s dumb war on things that work.\nDELIVERING ON PROMISES: By restoring shower freedom, President Trump is following through on his commitment to dismantle unnecessary regulations and put Americans first.\n- President Trump: “We’re going to get rid of those restrictions.

And it’s an unnecessary restriction.”\n- This Executive Order builds on actions President Trump has already taken to roll back overregulation and empower Americans, including:Cutting red tape across federal agencies to unleash economic growth.Repealing burdensome Biden-era executive actions that stifled freedom.\n\nFighting against radical green agendas that prioritize ideology over people.\n- Cutting red tape across federal agencies to unleash economic growth.\n- Repealing burdensome Biden-era executive actions that stifled freedom.\n- Fighting against radical green agendas that prioritize ideology over people."

Yet the previous administration did nothing effective to address the problem.\n- With adversaries like China and Russia rapidly advancing their own military technologies, it is essential to prioritize speed, flexibility, and innovation to deliver cutting-edge capabilities to our Armed Forces.\nREBUILDING OUR DEPLETED MILITARY: By signing this Executive Order, President Trump is demonstrating his serious commitment to ensuring our military remains the world’s most powerful.\n- President Trump campaigned on the promise to rebuild America’s depleted military, emphasizing the need to restore its strength and readiness after years of neglect.\n- President Trump: “[A]s I work to again rebuild America’s military strength and deterrence that Joe Biden so foolishly squandered, we need to take a long, hard look at defense procurement and our defense industrial base, because it’s been withered down to nothing. Given all the money we spend on the Pentagon, it’s unacceptable that we would ever run out of ammunition or be unable to quickly produce the weapons needed.”"

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Purpose. In order to secure America’s economic prosperity and national security, lower the cost of living, and provide for increases in electrical demand from emerging technologies, we must increase domestic energy production, including coal. Coal is abundant and cost effective, and can be used in any weather condition. Moreover, the industry has historically employed hundreds of thousands of Americans. America’s coal resources are vast, with a current estimated value in the trillions of dollars, and are more than capable of substantially contributing to American energy independence with excess to export to support allies and our economic competitiveness. Our Nation’s beautiful clean coal resources will be critical to meeting the rise in electricity demand due to the resurgence of domestic manufacturing and the construction of artificial intelligence data processing centers. We must encourage and support our Nation’s coal industry to increase our energy supply, lower electricity costs, stabilize our grid, create high-paying jobs, support burgeoning industries, and assist our allies.\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States that coal is essential to our national and economic security. It is a national priority to support the domestic coal industry by removing Federal regulatory barriers that undermine coal production, encouraging the utilization of coal to meet growing domestic energy demands, increasing American coal exports, and ensuring that Federal policy does not discriminate against coal production or coal-fired electricity generation.\nSec. 3. Strengthening Our National Energy Security. The Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC) shall designate coal as a “mineral” as defined in section 2 of Executive Order 14241 of March 20, 2025 (Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production), thereby entitling coal to all the benefits of a “mineral” under that order. Further, Executive Order 14241 is hereby amended by deleting the reference to “4332(d)(1)(B)” in section 6(d) of that order and replacing it with a reference to “4532(d)(1)(B)”.\nSec. 4. Assessing Coal Resources and Accessibility on Federal Lands. (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Energy shall submit a consolidated report to the President through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that identifies coal resources and reserves on Federal lands, assesses impediments to mining such coal resources, and proposes policies to address such impediments and ultimately enable the mining of such coal resources by either private or public actors.\n(b) The Secretary of Energy shall include in the report described in subsection (a) of this section an analysis of the impact that the availability of the coal resources identified could have on electricity costs and grid reliability.\nSec. 5. Lifting Barriers to Coal Mining on Federal Lands. (a) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall prioritize coal leasing and related activities, consistent with applicable law, as the primary land use for the public lands with coal resources identified in the report described in section 4(a) of this order and expedite coal leasing in these areas, including by utilizing such emergency authorities as are available to them and identifying opportunities to provide for expedited environmental reviews, consistent with applicable law.\n(b) The Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to the authorities in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended and supplemented (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.), the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of 1947, as amended (30 U.S.C. 351-359), and the Multiple Mineral Development Act of 1954 (30 U.S.C. 521-531 et seq.), shall acknowledge the end of the Jewell Moratorium by ordering the publication of a notice in the Federal Register terminating the “Environmental Impact Statement Analyzing the Potential Environmental Effects from Maintaining Secretary Jewell’s Coal Leasing Moratorium”, and process royalty rate reduction applications from Federal coal lessees in as expeditious a manner as permitted by applicable law.\nSec. 6. Supporting American Coal as an Energy Source.

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4), do hereby proclaim that certain stationary sources subject to the Rule, as identified in Annex I of this proclamation, are exempt from compliance with the Rule for a period of 2 years beyond the Rule’s compliance date — i.e., for the period beginning July 8, 2027, and concluding July 8, 2029 (Exemption).  The effect of this Exemption is that, during this 2-year period, these stationary sources are subject to the compliance obligations that they are currently subject to under the MATS as the MATS existed prior to the Rule.  In support of this Exemption, I hereby make the following determinations:a.  The technology to implement the Rule is not available.  Such technology does not exist in a commercially viable form sufficient to allow implementation of and compliance with the Rule by its compliance date of July 8, 2027.b. It is in the national security interests of the United States to issue this Exemption for the reasons stated in paragraph 3 of this proclamation.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand thiseighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.                                 DONALD J.

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  My Administration is committed to unleashing American energy, especially through the removal of all illegitimate impediments to the identification, development, siting, production, investment in, or use of domestic energy resources — particularly oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, geothermal, biofuel, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources.  An affordable and reliable domestic energy supply is essential to the national and economic security of the United States, as well as our foreign policy.  Simply put, Americans are better off when the United States is energy dominant. American energy dominance is threatened when State and local governments seek to regulate energy beyond their constitutional or statutory authorities.  For example, when States target or discriminate against out-of-State energy producers by imposing significant barriers to interstate and international trade, American energy suffers, and the equality of each State enshrined by the Constitution is undermined.  Similarly, when States subject energy producers to arbitrary or excessive fines through retroactive penalties or seek to control energy development, siting, or production activities on Federal land, American energy suffers.Many States have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, burdensome and ideologically motivated “climate change” or energy policies that threaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security.  New York, for example, enacted a “climate change” extortion law that seeks to retroactively impose billions in fines (erroneously labelled “compensatory payments”) on traditional energy producers for their purported past contributions to greenhouse gas emissions not only in New York but also anywhere in the United States and the world.  Vermont similarly extorts energy producers for alleged past contributions to greenhouse gas emissions anywhere in the United States or the globe.Other States have taken different approaches in an effort to dictate national energy policy.  California, for example, punishes carbon use by adopting impossible caps on the amount of carbon businesses may use, all but forcing businesses to pay large sums to “trade” carbon credits to meet California’s radical requirements.  Some States delay review of permit applications to produce energy, creating de facto barriers to entry in the energy market.  States have also sued energy companies for supposed “climate change” harm under nuisance or other tort regimes that could result in crippling damages.These State laws and policies weaken our national security and devastate Americans by driving up energy costs for families coast-to-coast, despite some of these families not living or voting in States with these crippling policies.  These laws and policies also undermine Federalism by projecting the regulatory preferences of a few States into all States.  Americans must be permitted to heat their homes, fuel their cars, and have peace of mind — free from policies that make energy more expensive and inevitably degrade quality of life.These State laws and policies try to dictate interstate and international disputes over air, water, and natural resources; unduly discriminate against out-of-State businesses; contravene the equality of States; and retroactively impose arbitrary and excessive fines without legitimate justification.These State laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration’s objective to unleash American energy.  They should not stand.\nSec. 2.  State Laws and Causes of Action.  (a)  The Attorney General, in consultation with the heads of appropriate executive departments and agencies, shall identify all State and local laws, regulations, causes of action, policies, and practices (collectively, State laws) burdening the identification, development, siting, production, or use of domestic energy resources that are or may be unconstitutional, preempted by Federal law, or otherwise unenforceable.  The Attorney General shall prioritize the identification of any such State laws purporting to address “climate change” or involving “environmental, social, and governance” initiatives, “environmental justice,” carbon or “greenhouse gas” emissions, and funds to collect carbon penalties or carbon taxes.(b)  The Attorney General shall expeditiously take all appropriate action to stop the enforcement of State laws and continuation of civil actions identified in subsection (a) of this section that the Attorney General determines to be illegal.(c)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General shall submit a report to the President, through the Counsel to the President, regarding actions taken under subsection (b) of this section.  The Attorney General shall also recommend any additional Presidential or legislative action necessary to stop the enforcement of State laws identified in subsection (a) of this section that the Attorney General determines to be illegal or otherwise fulfill the purpose of this order.\nSec. 3.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof;

If we do that, we’re going to hire them at very good jobs with very good pay,” Greenblatt told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “There’s going to be an overwhelming surge of hiring in America as things level out, as American factories ramp up … This is a very exciting time for the American manufacturing worker.”\n"

Today, the White House Office of Management and Budget, incoordination with the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, issued two revised policies to facilitate responsible AI adoption to improve public services. These policies fundamentally shift perspectives and direction from the prior Administration, focusing now on utilizing emerging technologies to modernize the Federal Government.\n- The Executive Branch is shifting to a forward-leaning, pro-innovation and pro competition mindset rather than pursuing the risk-averse approach of the previousadministration.\n- The Federal Government will no longer impose unnecessary bureaucratic restrictions on the use of innovative American AI in the Executive Branch.\n- By embracing AI adoption, agencies will be more agile, cost-effective, and efficient.\n- This shift will deliver improvements to the lives of the American public while enhancingAmerica’s global dominance in AI innovation.\nPROMOTING RAPID AND RESPONSIBLE AI ADOPTION: M-25-21 gives agencies thetools necessary to embrace AI innovation, while maintaining strong protections for Americans’ privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.\n- Agencies will empower AI leaders to remove barriers to AI innovation.\n\n Agency Chief AI Officer roles are redefined to serve as change agents and AI advocates, rather than overseeing layers of bureaucracy.\n\n\n\nChief AI Officers are tasked with promoting agency-wide AI innovation and adoption for lower risk AI, mitigating risks for higher-impact AI, and advising on agency AI investments and spending.\n- Agency Chief AI Officer roles are redefined to serve as change agents and AI advocates, rather than overseeing layers of bureaucracy.\n- Chief AI Officers are tasked with promoting agency-wide AI innovation and adoption for lower risk AI, mitigating risks for higher-impact AI, and advising on agency AI investments and spending.\n- Agencies will produce an AI adoption maturity assessment to better track progress andneeds.\n- Policies introduce a single “high-impact AI” category to track AI use cases that requireheightened due diligence because of potential impacts on the rights or safety of theAmerican people.\n- Accountability for AI will mirror the existing process for using government IT, instead ofcreating new layers of approvals.\n- Use of American AI will be maximized when seeking new AI solutions.\nDRIVING EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT AI ACQUISITION: M-25-22 provides agencieswith concise, effective guidance on how to acquire best-in-class AI quickly, competitively, and responsibly.\n- Agencies must support a competitive American AI marketplace, maximizing the use of American AI systems and services in support of American AI leadership, human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.\n- This policy recognizes the importance of competition, communicating clear and specific requirements that avoid vendor lock-in.\n- The new approach removes burdensome agency reporting requirements and optimizes the acquisition process, while continuing to protect privacy and ensure lawful use ofgovernment data.\n- Agencies will use performance-based techniques to best harness the rapidly developing AI marketplace and create an online shared repository of resources and tools to assist with AI procurement.\nAI WORKING FOR AMERICANS: Federal agencies are maximizing the benefits of AI topromote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security. Illustrativeexamples include the following:\n- The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) optimizes patient care through AI tools that help identify and standardize Veterans’ care.\n\nThe VA uses AI to support the identification and analysis of pulmonary nodulesduring lung cancer screening exams. The AI functionality improves detection of these nodules, assisting clinicians with life-saving diagnoses.\n- The VA uses AI to support the identification and analysis of pulmonary nodulesduring lung cancer screening exams.

    "content": "Today I’d like to discuss the United States’ provision of what economists call “global public goods,” for the entire world.  First, the United States provides a security umbrella which has created the greatest era of peace mankind has ever known.  Second, the U.S. provides the dollar and Treasury securities, reserve assets which make possible the global trading and financial system which has supported the greatest era of prosperity mankind has ever known.\nBoth of these are costly to us to provide.  On the defense side, our men and women in uniform take heroic risks to make our nation and the world safer, preserving our liberties generation after generation.  And we tax hardworking Americans mightily to finance global security.  On the financial side, the reserve function of the dollar has caused persistent currency distortions and contributed, along with other countries’ unfair barriers to trade, to unsustainable trade deficits.  These trade deficits have decimated our manufacturing sector and many working-class families and their communities, to facilitate non-Americans trading with each other.\nLet me clarify that by “reserve currency,” I mean all the international functions of the dollar—private savings and trade included.  I’ve often used the example that when private agents in two separate foreign countries trade with each other, it’s typically denominated in dollars because of America’s status as the reserve provider.  That trade entails savings housed in dollar securities, often Treasurys.  As a result of all this, Americans have been paying for peace and prosperity not just for themselves, but for non-Americans too.\nPresident Trump has made it clear that he will no longer stand for other nations free-riding on our blood, sweat, and tears, whether in national security or trade.  The Trump Administration has already, in its first hundred days, moved forcefully to reorient our defense and trading relationships to place Americans on fairer ground.  The President has promised to rebuild our broken industrial base and pursue trade terms that put American workers and businesses first.\nI’m an economist and not a military strategist, so I’ll dwell more on trade than on defense, but the two are deeply connected.  To see how it works, imagine two foreign nations, say China and Brazil, trading with each other.  Neither country has a currency that is trusted, liquid, and convertible, which makes trading with each other challenging.  However, because they can transact in U.S. dollars backed by U.S. Treasuries, they are able to trade freely with each other and prosper.  Such trade can only occur because of U.S. military might ensuring our financial stability and the credibility of our borrowing.  Our military and financial dominance cannot be taken for granted; and the Trump Administration is determined to preserve them.\nBut our financial dominance comes at a cost.  While it is true that demand for dollars has kept our borrowing rates low, it has also kept currency markets distorted.  This process has placed undue burdens on our firms and workers, making their products and labor uncompetitive on the global stage, and forcing a decline of our manufacturing workforce by over a third since its peak1 and a reduction in our share of world manufacturing production of 40%.\nWe need to be able to make things in this country, as we saw during Covid, when many of our supply chains could not survive without being reliant on our biggest adversary, China.  We clearly should not rely on our biggest adversary for equipment essential to keeping our population safe and secure.  Nor should our biggest adversary be allowed to benefit so much from an international security and financial architecture we finance.\nThere are other unfortunate side effects of providing reserve assets.  Others may buy our assets to manipulate their own currency to keep their exports cheap.  In doing so, they end up pumping so much money into the U.S. economy that it fuels economic vulnerabilities and crises.  For example, in the years running up to the 2008 crash, China along with many foreign financial institutions, increased their holdings of U.S. mortgage debt, which helped fuel the housing bubble, forcing hundreds of billions of dollars of credit into the housing sector without regard as to whether the investments made sense.  China played a meaningful role creating the Global Financial Crisis.  It took almost a decade to recover, until President Trump got us back on track in his first term.\nIn my view, to continue providing these twin global public goods, there needs to be improved burden-sharing at the global level.  If other nations want to benefit from the U.S. geopolitical and financial umbrella, then they need to pull their weight, and pay their fair share.  The costs cannot be solely borne by everyday Americans who have already given so much.\nThe best outcome is one in which America continues to create global peace and prosperity and remain the reserve provider, and other countries not only participate in reaping the benefits, but they also participate in bearing the costs.  By improving burden sharing, we can enhance resilience, and preserve the global security and trading systems for many decades into the future.\nMoreover, it is critical not just for fairness, but for capacity.  We are under siege by hostile adversaries trying to erode our manufacturing and defense industrial base and disrupt our financial system; we will be able to provide neither defense nor reserve assets if our manufacturing capacity is hollowed out.  The President has been clear that the United States is committed to remaining the reserve provider, but that the system must be made fairer.  We need to rebuild our industries to project the strength needed to protect reserve status, and we need to be able to pay our bills to do so.\nWhat forms can that burden sharing take?  There are many options, here are a few ideas:\n- First, other countries can accept tariffs on their exports to the United States without retaliation, providing revenue to the U.S. Treasury to finance public goods provision.  Critically, retaliation will exacerbate rather than improve the distribution of burdens and make it even more difficult for us to finance global public goods.\n- Second, they can stop unfair and harmful trading practices by opening their markets and buying more from America;\n- Third, they can boost defense spending and procurement from the U.S., buying more U.S.-made goods, and taking strain off our servicemembers and creating jobs here;\n- Fourth, they can invest in and install factories in America.  They won’t face tariffs if they make their stuff in this country;\n- Fifth, they could simply write checks to Treasury that help us finance global public goods.\nTariffs deserve some extra attention.  Most economists and some investors dismiss tariffs as counterproductive at best and devastatingly harmful at worst.  They’re wrong.\nOne reason the economic consensus on tariffs is so wrong is because nearly all of the models that economists use to study international trade assume either no trade deficits at all, or assume that deficits are short-lived and quickly self-correct through currency adjustments.  According to standard models, trade deficits will cause the dollar to weaken, which reduces imports and boosts exports, eventually wiping out the trade deficit.  If that happens, tariffs may be unnecessary, because trade will balance itself over time and, in this view, intervening with tariffs can only make things worse.\nHowever, that view is at odds with reality.  The United States has run current account deficits now for five decades, and these have widened precipitously in recent years, going from about 2% of GDP in the first Trump Administration to a high of nearly 4% of GDP in the Biden Administration2.  And this has happened all while the dollar has appreciated, not depreciated!\nThe long run is here, and the models are wrong.  One reason is that they fail to account for the U.S. provision of the global reserve currency.  Reserve status matters and, because demand for the dollar has been insatiable, it has been too strong for international flows to balance, even over five decades.\nMore recent economic analyses3 allow for the possibility of persistent trade deficits that resist automatically rebalancing, which is more in line with reality in the U.S.  They show that by imposing tariffs against exporting countries, the U.S. can improve economic outcomes, raise revenues, and impose huge losses for the tariffed nation, even with full retaliation.\nIn this sense, analysis of what economists call the “incidence” of tariffs indicates that a large share and burden of the tariffs are “paid for” by the country on which we’re applying the tariffs.  Countries that run large trade surpluses are pretty inflexible—they can’t find other sources of demand to substitute for America’s.  Instead, they have no choice but to export, and America is the largest consumer market in the world.  By contrast, America has plenty of substitution options: we can make stuff at home, or we can buy from countries that treat us fairly instead of from countries that take advantage of us.  This difference in leverage means that other countries end up bearing the cost of tariffs.\nIn 2018-2019, China bore the cost of President Trump’s historic tariffs through a weaker currency, meaning their citizens became poorer, with less purchasing power on the global stage.  The tariff revenue, paid for by China, was used to finance President Trump’s tax cuts for American workers and firms.  This time around, tariffs will help pay for both tax cuts and deficit reduction.\nLower taxes on Americans, financed in part by revenue provided from foreigners, will create economic growth, dynamism, and opportunity the likes of which our country has never seen, ushering in President Trump’s new Golden Age.  Deficit reduction will help lower Treasury rates, and with them mortgage rates and consumer credit card rates, stimulating an economic boom.\nIt is important to note here that tariffs are not levied simply to collect revenues.  For example, the President’s reciprocal tariffs are designed to address tariff and non-tariff barriers and other forms of cheating like currency manipulation, dumping, and subsidies to gain unfair advantage.  Revenue is a nice side effect, and if it is used in part for lowering taxes, it can help turbo-charge competitiveness improvements that boost U.S. exports.\nBurden sharing can allow the United States to continue leading the free world for many decades.  It’s a must not only for fairness, but for feasibility.  If we don’t rebuild our manufacturing sector, we will be strained in providing the security we need for our safety and to underpin our financial markets.  The world can still have the American defense umbrella and trading system, but it’s got to start paying its fair share for them.  Thank you, and I am happy to take some questions.\n[1] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP\n[2] https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BN.CAB.XOKA.GD.ZS?locations=US\n[3]

As he puts into action his bold plan to reverse the decades of globalization that has decimated our industrial base, President Trump is putting the Forgotten Men and Women of America first.\nThere’s a reason groups like the United Auto Workers, the Steel Manufacturers Association, the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, the Southern Shrimp Alliance, and the National Council of Textile Organizations have all praised President Trump’s policy.\nAcross the country, everyday Americans, small business owners, and industry leaders are supporting President Trump’s plan:\nIllinois cattle farmer Alan Adams: “We’ve struggled with tariffs my whole adult life in the cattle business, so we were happy last week to hear the president last week mentioned that beef was one of the things he wanted to have tariffs lowered. And so some of the European countries and Australia have been difficult for us to sell beef in — and so they get to sell beef into our country, and we’re happy to have them compete against us, but we’d like the same chance to sell the great taste of American beef to them.”\nFourth-generation Louisiana shrimp producer Acy Cooper: “We’ve been suffering for over 20 years … this country can’t feed itself, this country can’t sustain its own way of life. If we get into a war with China, one of our big importers … how are we going to feed the people of this country? … It has to come [from] within this country.”\nRetired auto worker Brian Pannebecker: “To see those plants close, one after another, and just sit idle and then fall into disrepair and collapse, they become abandoned buildings… I’m glad to see Donald Trump finally standing up saying he’s going to do something about it.”\nGuardian Bikes CEO Brian Riley: “[President Trump’s trade agenda] is a welcome departure from a trade and economic policy that prioritized offshoring production and cheap consumption.”\nPaddock Chevrolet, Inc., CEO Duane Paddock: “Whether President Trump was a Democrat or Republican, I have to have faith in my president and that’s what I choose to do … It’s a great opportunity for people to get back with manufacturing and have an opportunity to have a great middle-class life and increase their compensation over the course of time.”"

I think that’s pretty good — if we can take in 20% in tariffs and it’s a 0.7% increase … Households saw real net wages go up, so if wages go up faster than prices — which is not what happened over the past four years.”\n- On making goods in America: “We saw during COVID that [our] supply chains are not resilient … President Trump has decided that we cannot be at risk like that for our crucial medicines, for our semiconductors, for shipping.”\nSecretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick on Face the Nation\n- On trade as an issue of national security: “We don’t make medicine in this country anymore. We don’t make ships. We don’t have enough steel and aluminum to fight a battle … We got to stop having all the countries of the world ripping us off.”\n- On trade imbalances: “In 1980, we were a net investor, meaning we owned more of the rest of the world than they owned of us — and now, they own $18 trillion of us, net … Eventually, we’re not going to own America and we are going to be owned by the rest of the world.”\nNational Economic Director Kevin Hassett on This Week\n- On so-called free trade: “China entered the WTO in 2000. In the 15 years that followed, real incomes declined about $1,200 cumulatively over that time … We got the cheap goods at the grocery store, but then we had fewer jobs.”\nSecretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins on State of the Union\n- On using tariffs to level the playing field: “This whole concept is about rebuilding an American economy around American goods, around American industry … Mexico won’t take our corn. Australia won’t take our beef … It is time for a change.”\n- On the EU’s refusal to take American ag exports: “They are using fake science and unsubstantiated claims to not take our products … We produce the safest, the most secure, the best food in the world.”\n- On the agricultural trade deficit: “In the last four years, the cost of inputs for our farmers went up 30%. In the last four years, we had an agricultural export deficit that increased from zero when President Trump left to $49 billion.”\nAttorney General Pam Bondi on Fox News Sunday\n- On lawfare: “Just since January 20th, we’ve had over 170 lawsuits filed against us. That should be the constitutional crisis right there — 50 injunctions … trying to control his executive power.”\nSenior Counselor Peter Navarro on Sunday Morning Futures\n- On the need for tariffs: “It’s all these things that these foreign countries do that are designed, explicitly, to cheat us, and are sanctioned by the WTO. So, President Trump says, ‘No more’ … We’re headed towards a strong America that makes things again.”"

Tragically, 17 people lose their lives each day while waiting for a transplant, highlighting the urgent need for more registered donors.\nAnyone who is eligible, regardless of age or medical history, has the ability sign up to be an organ donor.  To enroll, visit your State registry, the Department of Motor Vehicles, or www.organdonor.gov.  The registration process is as simple as checking a box or registering online.\nThroughout this month, we honor the selfless donors who generously give life to others and celebrate the beneficiaries who receive health and healing.  The First Lady and I pray for all who await a transplant with anticipation and hope.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

    "content": "Today, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is announcing the release of the Trump Administration’s Drug Policy Priorities, a comprehensive and coordinated blueprint to reduce the devastating impact of illicit drugs on American society. The Statement lays out the urgent, first-year steps that must be taken to address the scourge of illicit drug use that continues plaguing our nation and taking American lives. The implementation of these priorities will complement President Trump’s tireless efforts to stop Foreign Terrorist Organizations, cartels, and drug traffickers from harming Americans, and will help build a safer, healthier future for America.\nIn the next year, the White House will work across the government to implement the following six priorities:\n“Terrorists, cartels, and other drug traffickers are taking hundreds of thousands of American lives by poisoning them for profit,” said Jon Rice, the ONDCP Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Director. “To meet the urgent need of this moment, the Trump Administration is launching an unprecedented whole-of-government effort to stop these drugs from entering our communities and hold drug traffickers accountable. The priorities in this framework outline the first steps to kick cartels out of our country, free Americans from the deadly grip of addiction, and guide America back to health and safety.”\nTo achieve our vision of a safer, healthier future for Americans, we will disrupt the supply chain from tooth to tail. We will continue to take decisive action and exploit all existing authorities, both punitive and economic, to eliminate the production and distribution networks that allow these drugs to reach the United States. We will develop bold policy choices, employ innovative and sophisticated technology, and create a skilled, recovery-ready workforce to combat this crisis and ensure the safety of all Americans. Domestically, we must acknowledge the complexity of substance use disorder and addiction. The statistics surrounding drug use and overdose deaths mandate a comprehensive approach that emphasizes drug use prevention and increases access to recovery and overdose prevention and reversal services. Recognizing that a sustainable solution requires coordination across all levels of government, we will collaborate with law enforcement, first responders, healthcare providers, community-based organizations, and individuals to ensure the health and well-being of all Americans.\nThe staggering loss of life caused by illicit drugs underscores the severity of the challenge, but the Trump Administration has already taken critical steps to confront this crisis through a series of Executive Orders that secure our borders, combat foreign terrorist organizations and drug trafficking organizations, and demand reform by source countries from which illicit drugs and precursor chemicals flow into the United States. Critically, the Trump Administration will identify and hold accountable those responsible for exacerbating the flow of drugs within our borders.\nWhile these Policy Priorities outline the broad areas of effort for the first year, the President’s drug control policy will evolve to keep pace with the changing landscape of illicit drug trafficking and ensure that our borders, communities, and schools are secure from the destructive influence of illicit drugs.\nTo read the Trump Administration’s Drug Policy Priorities, click here."

    "slug": "report-to-the-president-on-the-america-first-trade-policy-executive-summary",
    "content": "Pursuant to the January 20, 2025 Presidential Memorandum on America First Trade Policy (AFTP), directed to the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Homeland Security, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, U.S. Trade Representative, Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, the President instructed the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative to report to the President on April 1, 2025, on the topics set forth therein, consisting of 24 individual chapters containing the reviews, investigations, findings, identifications, and recommendations enumerated in Sections 2(a) through 4(g) of the Presidential Memorandum. The Report also includes the expanded scope of work on non-reciprocal trading practices directed by the February 13, 2025 Presidential Memorandum on Reciprocal Trade and Tariffs. The findings from Sections 3(c), 3(d), and 3(f) of the February 21, 2025 Presidential Memorandum on Defending American Companies and Innovators from Overseas Extortion and Unfair Fines and Penalties are incorporated therein. This unified report is delivered to the President accordingly.\nIntroduction\nAn America First Trade Policy will unleash investment, jobs, and growth at home; reinforce our industrial and technological advantages; reduce our destructive trade imbalance; strengthen our economic and national security; and deliver substantial benefits for American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses. The America First Trade Policy Report (the Report) provides a foundation and resource for trade policy actions that will Make America Great Again by putting America First. It presents comprehensive recommendations covering the full scope of trade policies and challenges, from market access and the de minimis duty exemption to export controls and outbound investment restrictions.\nThe need for an America First Trade Policy is self-evident. For decades, the United States has shed jobs, innovation, wealth, and security to foreign countries who have used a myriad of unfair, non-reciprocal, and distortive practices to gain advantage over our domestic producers. There is no better expression of this dangerous state of affairs than America’s large and persistent trade deficit in goods, which soared to $1.2 trillion in 2024. Emerging from a tenuous geopolitical landscape in the previous four years, the United States cannot approach international economic and industrial policy issues with malaise. Our Nation’s future prosperity and national security requires a coordinated, strategic approach that fully utilizes the authorities and expertise of the Federal government to ensure the enduring economic, technological, and military dominance of the United States.\nIt was for this reason that President Trump wasted no time in launching the America First Trade Policy mere hours after taking his oath of office. In the weeks that followed, he expanded the scope of work to include non-reciprocal trading practices—a key driver of the trade deficit—and foreign extortion of American firms, especially leading U.S. technology companies. For most administrations, success in any of the 24 separate workstreams discussed in the Report would represent some of the most significant international economic change in the history of the country. Each could easily take decades to resolve. In fact, it is precisely because decades have passed without resolution of these issues that urgent action is required today. The United States does not have decades to continue tinkering around the edges of international economics—the urgency of the situation requires bold action now.\nToday—on April 1—after a mere 71 days on the job, President Trump’s Administration delivered the results of its work. The Report provides the President with recommendations for transformative action. The Report charts a course for his Presidency to reshape U.S. trade relations by prioritizing economic and national security, and restoring the ability to make America, once again, a nation of producers and builders.\nSpecifically, the Report includes a chapter for each subsection in the AFTP Memorandum, with an additional chapter for Section 3(f) of Presidential Memorandum on Defending American Companies and Innovators from Overseas Extortion and Unfair Fines and Penalties; reporting pursuant to Sections 3(c) and 3(d) of the latter are included within Chapter 3. Although the full Report delivered to the President is non-public, what follows is a brief public summary of the contents of each chapter.\nAddressing Unfair and Unbalanced Trade\nChapter 1. Economic and National Security Implications of the Large and Persistent Trade Deficit (Section 2(a) of AFTP)\nThe Report opens with a discussion of the magnitude and urgency of the economic and national security threat posed by the large and persistent trade deficit. In particular, the trade deficit demonstrates a fundamental unfairness and lack of reciprocity in how the United States is treated by its trading partners. For decades, while the United States has kept its tariffs low and its economy open, our trading partners have imposed egregious tariff and non-tariff barriers on American goods and services.  These unfair and non-reciprocal trade practices have undermined U.S. competitiveness, leading to business closures, job losses, missed market opportunities for American exporters, loss of industrial capacity, and an atrophying of our defense industrial base and national security posture. The sum total of these various non-reciprocal practices is that American exporters are less competitive abroad and foreign imports are artificially more competitive in the United States. Hence, our large and persistent trade deficit. The Report makes recommendations to the President to reduce the trade deficit, including the imposition of a tariff on certain imports in pursuit of reciprocity and balanced trade.\nChapter 2. The External Revenue Service (Section 2(b) of AFTP)\nThrough a collaboration between the Department of Commerce (DOC), the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the creation of an External Revenue Service (ERS) offers an opportunity to improve tariff collection. Tariffs have historically played a central role in the collection of Federal revenues. One way the United States can maximize its revenue recovery while deterring fraudulent and unfair trade practices is by establishing a centralized system to optimize revenue collection in the form of an ERS. By closing regulatory gaps and modernizing revenue collection mechanisms, the United States can reaffirm its commitment to a strong, fair, and enforceable trade system that benefits American businesses and taxpayers alike.\nChapter 3. Review of Unfair and Non-Reciprocal Foreign Trade Practices (Section 2(c) of AFTP)\nU.S. trading partners pursue various unfair and non-reciprocal trade practices. In its review, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) identified more than 500 of these practices, and stakeholders reported many more during a public comment process. Many countries impose higher tariffs on U.S. exports than the United States imposes on imports from those countries. The U.S. average applied tariff is 3.3%. But the average tariffs in the European Union (EU) (5%), China (7.5%), Vietnam (9.4%), India (17%), and Brazil (11.2%) are all higher. The disparity is even more evident in specific products. The U.S. most-favored nation (MFN) tariff on passenger vehicles is 2.5%, but the EU, India, and China tariff cars at much higher rates, 10%, 70%, and 15% respectively. The United States has no tariffs on apples, but India has a 50% tariff and Turkey a 60.3% tariff.\nNon-tariff barriers by our trade partners are often an even greater obstacle. The EU only allows imports of shellfish from two states—Massachusetts and Washington—but the United States gives the EU unlimited access to the U.S. shellfish market. The United Kingdom (UK) maintains non-science-based standards that adversely affect U.S. exports of safe, high-quality beef and poultry products. Non-tariff barriers also include domestic economic policies that suppress domestic consumption. While the U.S. share of consumption to gross domestic product (GDP) is 68%, it is much lower in Ireland (24%), China (38%), and Germany (49%). This is because our trading partners pursue intentional policies of consumption-reduction (e.g., wage suppression and labor, environmental, and regulatory arbitrage) to gain unfair trade advantage over the United States. This, in turn, contributes to our large and persistent trade deficit. USTR recommends a number of ways in which current legal authorities might be used to address these unfair practices and trade barriers.\nChapter 4. Renegotiation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (Section 2(d) of AFTP)\nIn his first term, President Trump ended the job-killing North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and replaced it with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). USMCA gained new market access for American exporters and adopted rules to incentivize the reshoring of manufacturing to the United States. It also included an innovative review mechanism to ensure that the agreement is responsive to changing economic circumstances. Under the USMCA Implementation Act, USTR is statutorily required to initiate the review process ahead of the July 2026 deadline. Numerous changes are needed, such as stronger rules of origin to reduce the inflow of non-market economy content into the United States, expanded market access—especially for dairy exports to Canada, and action to address Mexico’s discriminatory practices, such as in the energy sector.\nChapter 5. Review of Foreign Currency Manipulation (Section 2(e) of AFTP)\nThe Secretary of the Treasury is required to assess the policies and practices of major U.S. trading partners with respect to the rate of exchange between their currencies and the United States dollar pursuant to section 4421 of title 19, United States Code, and section 5305 of title 22, United States Code. The Department of the Treasury will strengthen its ongoing currency analysis and address the lack of transparency by foreign governments in currency markets.\nChapter 6. Review of Existing Trade Agreements (Section 2(f) of AFTP)\nThe United States has 14 comprehensive trade agreements in force with 20 countries. There is significant scope to modernize existing U.S. trade agreements so that trade terms are aligned with American interests while addressing underlying causes of imbalances. This includes lowering foreign tariff rates for American exporters, improving transparency and predictability in foreign regulatory regimes, improving market access for U.S. agricultural products, strengthening rules of origin to ensure the benefits of the agreement appropriately flow to the parties, and improving the alignment of our trading partners with U.S. approaches to economic security and non-market policies and practices.\nChapter 7. Identification of New Agreements to Secure Market Access (Section 2(g) of AFTP)\nThe negotiation of new trade agreements with trading partners offers an opportunity for the United States to knock down non-reciprocal barriers to U.S. exports, especially for agricultural products, and reshape the global trading system in ways that promote supply chain resilience, manufacturing reshoring, and economic and national security alignment with partners. The Report identifies countries and sectors which may be ripe for the negotiation of America First Agreements.\nChapter 8. Review of Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duty Policies (Section 2(h) of AFTP)\nAdministered by DOC, anti-dumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) are a critical tool to address unfair trade and support domestic manufacturing. Recommendations include considering the addition of new countries to the list of non-market economies, methodologies to better implement AD/CVD laws, and more-active self-initiation of new investigations.\nChapter 9. Review of the De Minimis Exemption (Section 2(i) of AFTP)\nPackages containing imports valued at $800 or less imported by one person on one day currently enter the United States duty free. The United States should end this duty-free de minimis exemption.  This exception has resulted in approximately $10.8 billion in foregone tariff revenue in 2024 alone.  De minimis shipments also pose serious security risks to the United States. The de minimis exemption is a means by which fentanyl, counterfeit goods, and various deadly and high-risk products enter the United States with little scrutiny. Countless consumer products that don’t meet U.S. health and safety standards, such as flammable children’s pajamas and lead-ridden plumbing fixtures, enter the United States through under the de minimis administrative exemption every year.  This is in part because the government does not collect sufficient data on low-value shipments to allow for enforcement targeting.  The de minimis exemption also allows for importers to evade trade enforcement tariffs; for instance, goods entering through the de minimis exemption do not need to pay duties owed pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. With nearly four million packages arriving each day through the de minimis exemption, it is imperative that DOC and CBP recover our rightful tariff revenue and defend our national security by ending the exemption.\nChapter 10. Investigation of Extraterritorial Taxes (Section 2(j) of AFTP)\nThe United States must combat efforts by foreign governments to collect illegitimate revenue from U.S. firms by imposing various discriminatory taxes and regulatory regimes aimed to capture the success of America’s most successful companies—not the least of which are our leading technology firms. Digital Services Taxes, for example, are often devised so as to shield most non-U.S. headquartered firms from taxation and UTPRs determine tax based primarily on factors outside the taxing jurisdiction. We need to ensure we have available the tools necessary to defend U.S. interests, including by providing technical assistance in furtherance of new legislative tools and further investigating identified taxes to determine the appropriate action.\nChapter 11. Review of the Government Procurement Agreement (Section 2(k) of AFTP)\nBuy American is the epitome of common-sense public policy. In recent decades, the United States has weakened domestic procurement preferences by opening up our procurement market pursuant to the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). Unfortunately, this market access is lopsided. A 2019 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on the GPA found that in 2010, the United States reported $837 billion in GPA coverage. This was twice as much as the $381 billion reported by the next five largest GPA parties (the EU, Japan, South Korea, Norway, and Canada), despite the fact that total U.S. procurement was less than that of these five partners combined. Moreover, some GPA partners open their procurement markets to third countries who are not parties, forcing U.S. suppliers to compete for the preferential market access they are entitled to under the agreement. To address this lack of reciprocity and unfair competition, the United States should modify or renegotiate the GPA, and if unsuccessful, withdraw.\nAn additional challenge is that, although defense procurement is closed to GPA partners, the Department of Defense still gives countries access to our huge defense procurement market by negotiating Reciprocal Defense Procurement (RDP) agreements. Shockingly, these RDPs not only open our market to foreign suppliers, but also require U.S. firms to move industrial capacity offshore as a condition of access to the markets of partner countries. These RDPs must be reviewed to ensure they put America First.\nEconomic and Trade Relations with the People’s Republic of China\nChapter 12. Review of the Phase One Agreement (Section 3(a) of AFTP)\nA key success of President Trump’s first term was the Phase One Agreement with China. Unfortunately, five years following the entry into force in February 2020, China’s lack of compliance with the Agreement is a serious concern. China has failed to live up to its commitments on agriculture, financial services, and protection of intellectual property (IP) rights. USTR assessed this lack of compliance and recommends potential responses.\nChapter 13. Assessment of the Section 301 Four-Year Review (Section 3(b) of AFTP)\nThe United States imposed tariffs pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 in 2018. The law requires that Section 301 actions be reviewed every four years by USTR. The first Four-Year Review was completed in May 2024 and resulted in increases of some of the Section 301 tariffs on China. USTR assessed the results of this review to ensure the Section 301 action remains fit for purpose.\nChapter 14. Identification of New Section 301 Actions (Section 3(c) of AFTP)\nGiven the expansiveness of China’s non-market policies and practices, there may be a need for additional Section 301 investigations. USTR looked at various elements of China’s non-market policies and practices to identify additional investigations that may be warranted.\nChapter 15. Assessment of Permanent Normal Trade Relations (Section 3(d) of AFTP)\nAfter China was granted Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with the United States in 2000, China took full advantage of the openness of the U.S. economy by leveraging its state-directed capital investments and subsidies, industrial overcapacity, lax labor and environmental standards, forced technology transfer policies, and countless protectionist measures. U.S. goods imports from China increased from $100 billion in 2000 to $463.9 billion in 2024, while the U.S. trade deficit in goods with China ballooned from $83.8 billion in 2000 to $295.4 billion in 2024. More than two decades after being granted PNTR, China still embraces a non-market economic system. USTR carefully reviewed legislative proposals related to PNTR and advised the President accordingly.\nChapter 16. Assessment of Reciprocity for Intellectual Property (Section 3(e) of AFTP)\nThe full extent of China’s abusive tactics and practices with respect to U.S. intellectual property is staggering. The Report catalogues China’s abuses of this system and recommends appropriate responsive actions to address China’s massive imbalance on treatment of intellectual property.\nAdditional Economic Security Matters\nChapter 17. Identification of New Section 232 Actions (Section 4(a) of AFTP)\nIn his first term, President Trump used Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to save America’s steel and aluminum industries. Last week, President Trump invoked Section 232 to impose a 25% tariff on foreign automobiles and certain automobile parts to protect our automotive industrial base. Reshoring industrial production in key sectors is critical to national security, and DOC identified additional products and sectors that merit consideration for initiation of new Section 232 investigations, including pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and certain critical minerals.\nChapter 18. Review of Section 232 Action on Steel and Aluminum (Section 4(b) of AFTP)\nOn February 11, President Trump ended all product exclusions and country exemptions for the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum. DOC further explains the basis for this needed action and recommends additional measures for steel and aluminum for that could be taken.\nChapter 19. Review of U.S. Export Controls (Section 4(c) of AFTP)\nThe United States must ensure that its advanced technology does not flow to our adversaries. Export controls should be simpler, stricter, and more effective, while promoting U.S. dominance in AI and asserting global technological leadership.\nChapter 20. Review of the Office of Information and Communication Technology and Services (Section 4(d) of AFTP)\nUsing his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), President Trump created a new Office of Information and Communication Technology and Services (ICTS) at DOC in his first term. In the last administration, however, ICTS was underutilized. DOC reviewed ongoing ICTS work and identified key areas to strengthen and improve in line with ITCS’s original intent, including expanding its scope and remit to encompass advanced technologies controlled by our adversaries.\nChapter 21. Review of Outbound Investment Restrictions (Section 4(e) of AFTP)\nPresident Trump’s America First Investment Policy serves as a basis for how the Administration will approach investment policy, including on outbound investment restrictions. Pursuant to the America First Investment Policy, the National Security Council and the Department of the Treasury will evaluate options that allow American business to thrive while ensuring that they, too, put America First and do not undermine U.S. national security interests. Among the things the Administration plans to evaluate is whether the scope of outbound investment restrictions should be expanded to be responsive to developments in technology and the strategies of countries of concern.\nChapter 22. Assessment of Foreign Subsidies on Federal Procurement (Section 4(f) of AFTP)\nForeign subsidies can disadvantage domestic products in a country’s government procurement market. The EU has recognized this problem and introduced the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR) to address distortions caused by foreign subsidies for public procurement. OMB assessed the value of the FSR and other policies to tilt the playing field in favor U.S. producers by strengthening domestic procurement preferences and closing loopholes.\nChapter 23. Assessment of Unlawful Migration and Fentanyl Flows from Canada, Mexico, and China (Section 4(g) of AFTP)\nOn February 1, President Trump invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China to stop the threat posed by the flow of illegal migrants and drugs into the United States. DOC and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) elaborated on the necessity for the strong action already taken by President Trump and identified measures to further stem the flow of illegal migrants and drugs into the United States.\nChapter 24. E-Commerce Moratorium (Section 3(f) of Presidential Memorandum on Defending American Companies and Innovators from Overseas Extortion and Unfair Fines and Penalties)\nAt present, WTO Members have committed to a temporary moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions, known popularly as the e-commerce moratorium. In other words, no tariffs on data flows. However, some countries—such as India, Indonesia, and South Africa—seek to tariff the flow of data, thereby destroying the internet and harming the competitiveness for U.S. companies that are global leaders. USTR assessed the risks posed by data tariffs and made recommendations to ensure that the e-commerce moratorium is made permanent.\nConclusion\nThe Report offers a broad, yet substantive, view of U.S. trade policy as it currently stands, and articulates a roadmap for where it should go. The U.S. trade policy of today does not address long-standing and destructive global imbalances, nor does it reflect the reality that the United States is the most open, innovative, and dynamic economy in the world, which is why we must work to unlock its full potential.  Now is the time to pursue trade and economic policies that put the American economy, the American worker, and our national security first. This Report provides a foundation to do exactly that."

    "content": "By the President of the United States of AmericaA Proclamation\nDuring Cancer Control Month, we honor the unwavering strength and courage of every American battling cancer and celebrate with over 18 million survivors who are still with us today.  We also hold dear the memories of beloved family members and friends that we have lost to this devastating disease.  My Administration remains devoted to pursuing groundbreaking medical advancement and spearheading innovative treatments to combat and prevent all forms of cancer.\nLast year, over 2 million Americans were diagnosed with cancer, and more than 600,000 lost their lives to this horrific disease.  Since 1990, adult cancer cases have surged by 88 percent, while childhood cancer cases, though still uncommon, has incrementally increased by 0.8 percent annually since 1975, leading to a more than 40 percent increase in the past 50 years.  These trends indicate that something is wrong.  That is why I have proudly established the Make America Healthy Again Commission to address the root causes of America’s chronic disease crisis.\nMy Administration is committed to lowering healthcare costs; making additional treatment options available through Right to Try; and rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in Government.  By promoting transparency and ending conflicts of interest in federally funded health research, we are working to restore trust in our medical and scientific institutions.  As President, I am also tapping into emerging technologies like artificial intelligence to support cutting-edge research in innovative fields like genomics and immunotherapy, pioneering medical advances that will improve the lives of cancer patients.\nCancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States.  However, there are encouraging signs of progress.  The combined death rate from all types of cancer continues to decline among both men and women, and the mortality rates for several common cancers — including lung, colon, breast, and ovarian — are steadily decreasing.  These promising developments reflect the unending efforts of our Nation’s dedicated healthcare professionals to diagnose cancers at earlier stages, improve prevention, and enhance treatment.\nAmericans must take action to prevent and combat cancer.  Maintaining a healthy weight, adopting balanced eating habits, and engaging in regular physical activity may help prevent kidney, endometrial, esophageal, colorectal, and other cancers.  Avoiding tobacco use and alcohol consumption can also help prevent and combat cancers.  Additionally, Americans should discuss their family medical history with their doctors and undergo recommended screenings.  This can lead to an early diagnosis and increase the odds of overcoming the disease.\nAs a country, we will continue to push the boundaries of medical innovation, driven by the unwavering spirit of the American people.  Together, we will work to vanquish cancer, eradicating the suffering and pain it has inflicted on too many American families.  I have unshakable faith in the greatness of our Nation and the excellence of our people.  We will continue to fight until we find a long-sought cure, and we will emerge victorious in our fight against cancer.\nThe Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148; 36 U.S.C. 103), as amended, has requested the President to issue an annual proclamation declaring April as “Cancer Control Month.”\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2025 as Cancer Control Month.  I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with relevant programs, ceremonies, and activities.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand thisthird day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.                               DONALD J. TRUMP"

    "content": "By the President of the United States of AmericaA Proclamation\nThis month, we recognize National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month by ending the unfathomable human abuse committed under open borders policies.\nOne of the leading causes of sexual violence over the last 4 years has been the invasion of illegal aliens at our southern border.  In a treasonous act of betrayal against the American people, the previous administration unleashed an army of gangs and criminal aliens from the darkest and most dangerous corners of the world — causing a dramatic increase of sexual violence in our neighborhoods and communities.  These reckless policies empowered some of the most depraved people on the planet to exploit women and children in the most vicious ways imaginable.\nWe will never forget the names of precious American souls like Jocelyn Nungaray, Laken Riley, Rachel Morin, and many others who were savagely killed by illegal alien crime.  Last June, 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray was brutally assaulted and murdered by two illegal aliens in her home state of Texas.  To memorialize her young life and love of nature and animals, I proudly renamed the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge in Texas to the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge.  May this be Jocelyn’s little piece of Heaven on Earth.\nEvery act of violence committed against an American at the hands of an illegal alien is a crime beyond all comprehension.  For that reason, I am doing everything in my power to defend the dignity of every human life, keep violent criminals out of our country, and end sexual violence — including the degrading scourge of sex trafficking, a form of modern-day slavery that has battered multitudes of innocent lives and scarred untold numbers of our most vulnerable fellow citizens.\nTo protect our communities, one of my first actions as President was to declare a national emergency at the southern border.  I also designated cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists to end their campaign of violence and bloodshed.  In my first legislative action as President, I signed into law the Laken Riley Act, which requires U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain illegal aliens convicted of burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.  I have also initiated the largest deportation operation in the history of our country — including the deportation of hundreds of illegal alien gang members to El Salvador.\nAs President, I am bringing back security on our border, safety on our streets, and law and order in our communities.  Under my leadership, human trafficking is being brought to a rapid end, and justice is being swiftly served.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2025 as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.  I urge all Americans, families, law enforcement personnel, healthcare providers, and community and faith-based organizations to support survivors of sexual assault and work together to prevent these crimes in their communities.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.\nDONALD J. TRUMP\n"

    "slug": "support-grows-for-president-trumps-america-first-reciprocal-trade-plan",
    "content": "One day after President Donald J. Trump announced a new chapter in American prosperity, support continues to roll in for his bold vision to reverse the decades of globalization that has decimated our industrial base.\nThe support is bipartisan, with Democrat Rep. Jared Golden lauding President Trump’s plan: “I’m pleased the president is building his tariff agenda on the foundation of a universal 10 percent tariff like the one I proposed in the BUILT USA Act. This ring fence around the American economy is a good start to erasing our unsustainable trade deficits. I’m eager to work with the president to fix the broken ‘free trade’ system that made multinational corporations rich but ruined manufacturing communities across the country.”\nHere’s what else they’re saying:\nCoalition for a Prosperous America Chairman Zach Mottl: “A permanent, universal baseline tariff resets the global trade environment and finally addresses the destructive legacy of decades of misguided free-trade policies. President Trump’s decision to implement a baseline tariff is a game-changing shift that prioritizes American manufacturing, protects working-class jobs, and safeguards our economic security from adversaries like China. This is exactly the type of bold action America needs to restore its industrial leadership. Today’s action will deliver lasting benefits to the U.S. economy and working-class Americans, cementing President Trump’s legacy as one that ushered in a new Golden Age of American industrialization and prosperity.”\nNational Cattlemen’s Beef Association SVP of Government Affairs Ethan Lane: “For too long, America’s family farmers and ranchers have been mistreated by certain trading partners around the world. President Trump is taking action to address numerous trade barriers that prevent consumers overseas from enjoying high-quality, wholesome American beef. NCBA will continue engaging with the White House to ensure fair treatment for America’s cattle producers around the world and optimize opportunities for exports abroad.”\nSteel Manufacturers Association President Philip K. Bell: “President Trump is a champion of the domestic steel industry, and his America First Trade Policy is designed to fight the unfair trade that has harmed American workers and weakened manufacturing in the United States. The recently reinvigorated 232 steel tariffs have already started creating American jobs and bolstering the domestic steel industry. President Trump is working to turn America into a manufacturing powerhouse and the steel tariffs are driving that movement. President Trump’s initial 232 steel tariffs and the historic tax cuts led to investments of nearly $20 billion by steel manufacturers in the United States. Since the revised tariffs took effect, Hyundai Steel announced a $5.8 billion steel mill in Louisiana, demonstrating that the tariffs are working to bring more steel investments and production to the United States. The domestic steel market is stronger when other nations are forced to compete on a level playing field. On a level playing field, American workers can outcompete anyone. We look forward to continuing working with President Trump and his administration to ensure a level playing field for Americans and a robust domestic steel industry that strengthens our national, economic and energy security.”\nAlliance for American Manufacturing President Scott Paul: “Today’s trade action prioritizes domestic manufacturers and America’s workers. These hardworking men and women have seen unfair trade cut the ground from beneath their feet for decades. They deserve a fighting chance. Our workers can out-compete anyone in the world, but they need a level playing field to do it. This trade reset is a necessary step in the right direction.”\nNational Electrical Contractors Association CEO David Long: “President Trump has consistently prioritized policies that put the electrical industry as a priority, and we recognize his commitment to strengthening our nation’s economy. As these new tariffs take effect, we look forward to working with the Administration to ensure that electrical contractors and the entire electrical industry can continue powering America efficiently while navigating potential cost and supply chain challenges.”\nAmerican Compass Chief Economist Oren Cass: “The new policies announced by President Trump today confirm the end of the disastrous WTO era and lay the groundwork for a new set of arrangements in the international economy that prioritize the national interest and the flourishing of the nation’s working families.”\nNational Council of Textile Organizations CEO Kim Glas: “We strongly commend President Trump and his administration on their tariff reciprocity plan to finally begin rebalancing America’s trade positioning in markets at home and abroad. We want to thank President Trump on behalf of the U.S. textile industry and the 471,000 workers we employ.”\nSouthern Shrimp Alliance Executive Director John Williams: “We’ve watched as multigenerational family businesses tie up their boats, unable to compete with foreign producers who play by a completely different set of rules. We are grateful for the Trump Administration’s actions today, which will preserve American jobs, food security, and our commitment to ethical production.”\nAmerican Iron and Steel Institute President Kevin Dempsey: “AISI thanks President Trump for standing up for American workers by restoring fairness in international trade and addressing non-reciprocal trade relationships. American steel producers are all too familiar with the detrimental effects of unfair foreign trade practices on domestic industries and their workers. Driven by subsidies and other foreign government trade-distorting practices, global overcapacity in the steel industry reached 573 million metric tons in 2024 and has spurred high levels of exports of steel from countries like China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and Indonesia that continue to produce steel in volumes that significantly exceed their domestic demand. These exports directly and indirectly injure steel producers in the U.S. and government action to address this unloading of steel overproduction on world markets is overdue.”\nAmericans for Limited Government Executive Director Robert Romano: “Thank you, President Trump, for putting America first and finally once and for all levying the same tariffs on trade partners that they have levied mercilessly on the United States for decades. This was not an easy decision to make, but one that is long overdue with a record $1.2 trillion trade in goods deficit in 2024 after the failed rule of former President Joe Biden. … Under President Trump’s leadership, America will be the industrial and technology leader of the world, with commitments for hundreds of billions of investments in the United States. For countries that want to avoid the tariffs, it’s simple: Build in America. … Thank you again, President Trump, for your leadership in restoring reciprocity in trade and for having the courage that all of our other leaders have lacked.”\nAmerican Petroleum Institute: “We welcome President Trump’s decision to exclude oil and natural gas from new tariffs, underscoring the complexity of integrated global energy markets and the importance of America’s role as a net energy exporter. We will continue working with the Trump administration on trade policies that support American energy dominance.”\nNational Association of Home Builders Chairman Buddy Hughes: “NAHB is pleased President Trump recognized the importance of critical construction inputs for housing and chose to continue current exemptions for Canadian and Mexican products, with a specific exemption for lumber from any new tariffs at this time. NAHB will continue to work with the administration to find ways to increase domestic lumber production, reduce regulatory burdens, and create an environment that allows builders to increase our nation’s housing supply.”\nInternational Dairy Foods Association SVP of Trade and Workforce Policy Becky Rasdall Vargas: “The U.S. dairy industry exports more than $8 billion of high-quality dairy products every year to approximately 145 countries around the world. To meet growing global demand, dairy businesses have invested $8 billion in new processing capacity here in the United States—creating jobs, strengthening rural economies, and positioning America as the world’s leading dairy supplier. This growth depends on strong trade relationships and access to essential ingredients, finished goods, packaging, and equipment to provide Americans with safe, affordable, and nutritious dairy foods and beverages. IDFA supports the Trump Administration’s efforts to hold trading partners accountable and expand market access for U.S. dairy.”\nBienvenido Empresarios: “As an organization committed to empowering Hispanic Americans and strengthening our nation’s future, Bienvenido supports policies that build a more resilient American economy, safeguard our communities, and reassert U.S. leadership on the global stage. President Trump’s emphasis on using economic leverage — including tariffs — reflects a broader strategy to counter China, confront the deadly fentanyl crisis, and bring critical industries back home. Now is a time for tough, decisive action when national security and American livelihoods are at stake. Our hope is that these measures lead to stronger enforcement, fairer trade, and long-term prosperity for all Americans.”\nAmerica First Policy Institute: “Tariffs worked then—and they’ll work again. Under President Trump, tariffs brought back jobs, lowered inflation, and strengthened national security. It’s not just economic policy—it’s America First in action.”\nAuthor Batya Ungar-Sargon: “[President Trump] is saying we’re going to invest heavily in our middle class. We are no longer going to be a country in which our economy is an upward funnel of wealth from the hardest-working Americans into the pockets of the international global elites.”\nFox Business Network’s Charles Payne: “President Trump ran on tariffs. What we just saw was a president who did what he said he was going to do … This system is unsustainable … Is our patriotism tied to Wall Street? Or should it be tied to our own personal ability to achieve the American Dream?”\nRepublic Financial Chairman Nate Morris: “As someone who was raised by a proud autoworker – thank you President Trump for putting AMERICAN workers first again!”\nCommentator Geraldo Rivera: “The family did visit Japan… we did not see a single American car on the road in Tokyo — not a Caddy, not a Buick, not a Ford, not a Chevy… I have an innate sense that there’s something unfair going on… if they are screwing us, we got to tax them.”\nCommentator Bill O’Reilly: “We’ve been getting hosed since World War II by the trade imbalance … You can do what Biden and Obama did, which is just ignore it completely … The numbers are staggering, and the best part of Trump’s speech today was that he said that if you go to Japan or South Korea or China or Germany, you’re not going to see any American cars because they won’t let them in … Trump is right.”\nCPAC Chairman Matt Schlapp: “America cannot afford to be taken advantage of any longer.  Even our friends and strategic allies have for too long assumed that the United States could absorb unfair treatment, including high tariffs on American goods.  We applaud the steps taken by President Trump today to defend American manufacturers not because we like higher taxes, but because we know that trade is only free when both sides follow similar rules.  What President Trump understands is that America needs to get back on track by improving our domestic competitiveness by cutting taxes and regulations AND we need to take on the globalists who believe Americans should not always have to take it in the chops.  Real respect begins with economic reciprocity.”\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: “President Trump is sending a clear message with Liberation Day: America will not be exploited by unfair trade practices anymore. These tariffs restore fair and reciprocal trade and level the playing field for American workers and innovators. The President understands that FREE trade ONLY works when it’s FAIR!”\nGov. Jeff Landry: “Pro Jobs. Pro Business. Pro America.”\nSenate Majority Whip John Barrasso: “President Trump is acting boldly to put America first. America needs fair and free trade. We can’t allow other countries to keep abusing our workers and job creators. It’s time we had a level playing field. I applaud President Trump’s 100% commitment to Made in America.”\nSen. Jim Banks: “The decision by President Trump today to impose reciprocal tariffs will be so good for Indiana. … Those are the manufacturing jobs that President Trump is bringing back from overseas.”\nSen. Bill Cassidy: “The president’s trade agenda can pave the way for stronger trade deals, fairer rules, and real results. I am excited to work with President Trump to make it happen. Louisiana’s workers and families deserve nothing less.”\nSen. John Kennedy: “America is rich. We buy a lot of stuff. President Trump is saying that if you foreign businesses want to sell in America, then move your business here and hire American workers.”\nSen. Roger Marshall: “President Donald Trump is fighting for long-term solutions to put America’s farmers and ranchers first.”\nSen. Ashley Moody: “It’s liberation day in America! Today, @POTUS sent a message to the world that the era of America being taken advantage of is over.”\nSen. Bernie Moreno: “President Trump is finally reversing their failed policies and fighting back for American workers.”\nSen. Markwayne Mullin: “President Trump is going to charge foreign countries roughly half of what they *already* charge us to do business. Literally who can argue with this?”\nSen. Pete Ricketts: “President Trump is delivering on his campaign promises to level the playing field and stand up for the American people. Reciprocal tariffs will ensure equal treatment for American businesses. @POTUS is working to reshore jobs lost overseas and secure our supply chains. He is working to open new markets for our nation’s agriculture products. He is demonstrating to foreign adversaries like China that we will no longer be taken advantage of.”\nSen. Rick Scott: “The days of the U.S. being taken advantage of by other countries are OVER! Pres. Trump is making it clear that he will ALWAYS put American jobs, manufacturing and our economy first. As Americans, let’s stand with him and support one another by buying products MADE IN AMERICA.”\nSen. Eric Schmitt: “President Trump is bringing America back. We won’t be ripped off by other countries anymore. We’re bringing back manufacturing, unleashing energy production, and paving the way for prosperity.”\nSen. Tim Sheehy: “They tariff us at up to 50% of our exported ag products and then dump mass produced ag products into our market severely hurting our farmers and ranchers. It’s about time we have a level playing field for businesses.”\nSen. Tommy Tuberville: “For too long, other countries have ripped us off with bad trade deals – resulting in American jobs and manufacturing moving overseas. But change is coming. The Golden Age of America’s economy is here. Happy Liberation Day.”\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise: “The United States and American workers will no longer be ripped off by other countries with unfair trade practices. Thank you President Trump for putting America’s workers and innovators first with reciprocal tariffs that level the playing field and make trade FAIR.”\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer: “For too long, foreign countries have taken advantage of us at the expense of American workers. President @realDonaldTrump says NO MORE.”\nHouse Republican Conference Chairwoman Lisa McClain: “Tariffs work! @POTUS has proven tariffs are an effective tool in achieving economic and strategic objectives. The President’s long-term strategy will pay off.”\nRep. Elise Stefanik: “I strongly support President Trump’s America First economic policies to strengthen American manufacturing and create millions of American jobs. For too long, Americans have suffered under unfair trade practices putting America Last. We will not allow other countries to take advantage of us and we must put America and the American worker first.”\nRep. Jason Smith: “America shouldn’t reward countries that discriminate against American workers and manufacturers. On Liberation Day, President Trump is correcting this and demanding fair treatment for American producers.”\nRep. Mark Alford: “The days of the United States being taken advantage of are OVER. Republicans are putting American workers FIRST.”\nRep. Rick Allen: “@POTUS is undoing decades of unfair trade practices and putting American workers, businesses, and manufacturers FIRST. These reciprocal tariffs are simply leveling the playing field and will help ensure the U.S. is no longer on the losing end of global trade.”\nRep. Jodey Arrington: “For too long, our leaders have allowed other nations to rip us off through numerous unfair trade practices resulting in suppressed wages, lost opportunities, and unrealized economic growth. Just as he did in his first term, President Trump is fighting to ensure an even playing field for our manufacturers, farmers, and workers so we can unleash American prosperity and Make America Great Again.”\nRep. Brian Babin: “Trump’s tariffs aren’t starting a trade war—they’re ending one. For decades, other countries ripped off American workers with unfair tariffs and barriers. Now, we’re finally fighting back.”\nRep. Andy Biggs: “Past administrations have allowed the United States to be ripped off by allies and adversaries alike. President Trump said “NO MORE!” The Art of the Deal.”\nRep. Vern Buchanan: “For too long, unfair trade practices devastated America’s manufacturing base and stole millions of blue-collar jobs. It’s time to level the playing field and bring those jobs back. @POTUS is fighting for American workers.”\nRep. Eli Crane: “America First policies are what the American people voted for.”\nRep. Michael Cloud: “America-First means putting the American people first. We will no longer be taken advantage of as a nation and people.”\nRep. Andrew Clyde: “For far too long, the U.S. has been ripped off by countries across the globe with unfair trade practices. Now, we’re finally leveling the playing field. THANK YOU, President Trump, for putting American workers and manufacturing FIRST.”\nRep. Mike Collins: “This is fair. Whether it’s our military or economy, other countries have taken advantage of the U.S. for far too long. That time is over.”\nRep. Byron Donalds: “For decades, a lot of these countries have built their economies on the back of the American economy … These nations have become, not just developing nations, they are now strong economies. And so, we have to have fair trade if we’re going to have free trade.”\nRep. Chuck Edwards: “Many countries are taking advantage of the United States by imposing tariffs against us while we don’t have reciprocal tariffs against them. @POTUS has used tariffs to produce successful trade deals for us in his first term, and I support his plan to use them again to create a more level playing field and secure fairer trade deals for America. The quicker other countries agree to fairer trade deals, the quicker the tariffs can end.”\nRep. Gabe Evans: “This admin puts America first from strengthening our economy & national security to prioritizing hard working Americans. Farmers in #CO08 have been disadvantaged in foreign trade deals & will benefit from reciprocal tariffs that promote FAIR & free trade.”\nRep. Scott Franklin: “For years the US handcuffed itself and played nice while other countries imposed massive tariffs and took advantage of us. We’re done putting America last. @POTUS is leveling the playing field, ending trade imbalances and prioritizing American workers and manufacturing again!”\nRep. Mike Flood: “Biden did nothing for four years on trade. Five years after Brexit, America doesn’t have a free trade deal with the UK. President @realDonaldTrump is rightsizing our trade relationships.”\nRep. Russell Fry: “HAPPY LIBERATION DAY. Thanks to @POTUS, America is DONE being taken advantage of. A new era has begun.”\nRep. Lance Gooden: “For decades, Washington allowed Texans to be ripped off by foreign countries. Those days are now over. @POTUS is committed to making America wealthy again!”\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene: “If you want to do business in America, you need to play by our rules. For too long, American businesses, big and small, have been ripped off by bad trade deals and unfair competition. President Trump is putting a stop to it. He’s standing up for our workers, our companies, and our consumers.”\nRep. Abe Hamadeh: “The America First Republican party is the party of the working class, the forgotten men and women. On this Liberation Day, we further our commitment to them, that we will reshore our manufacturing, restore fair trade, and rebuild the greatest economy in the world.”\nRep. Pat Harrigan: “If you want access to the most powerful economy in the world, treat us fairly. If not, don’t expect a free ride. That’s real leadership and @POTUS is delivering it!”\nRep. Andy Harris: “President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs will put the American worker first and bring fairness back to international trade. America is being respected again.”\nRep. Diana Harshbarger: “President Trump is bringing back the American Dream. Our taxpayers have been ripped off by foreign countries for far too long, but those days are over. President Trump is right to impose these reciprocal tariffs.”\nRep. Clay Higgins: “.@POTUS’ trade agenda puts American industry and America first. I support the President’s action to protect our domestic producers.”\nRep. Wesley Hunt: “Today, President Trump empowered the American middle class.  His policies on tariffs will bring automotive manufacturing back to America.”\nRep. Morgan Luttrell: “President Trump is putting America First on trade—standing up to foreign adversaries, protecting American workers, and rebuilding our manufacturing base. The days of unfair trade deals and economic surrender are OVER.”\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis: “Since President Trump has been elected, we’ve attracted $5 trillion in private investment, foreign & domestic companies have announced Made in USA manufacturing, countries have reduced tariffs or changed foreign policies. President Trump is sticking up for American workers & farmers, repatriating our supply chain and protecting our national security.”\nRep. Addison McDowell: “My district was hit hard over the years by unfair trade deals. Finally, we have a President who wants to put the American worker FIRST.”\nRep. Dan Meuser: “We have been treated unfairly. Free trade has become synonymous with unfair trade, and @POTUS is recognizing that… We needed a reckoning; we needed a correction. President Trump is bringing it.”\nRep. Mary Miller: “America will no longer be taken advantage of! This is how you put America First.”\nRep. John Moolenaar: “For far too long, the Chinese Communist Party has exploited America’s generosity, stolen our intellectual property, and undermined our workers. President Trump’s recent tariffs and the Restoring Trade Fairness Act, which I introduced earlier this year to revoke China’s permanent normal trade relations status, will finally put an end to this abuse—holding China accountable and protecting American jobs. For decades, we’ve accepted one-sided trade deals that hurt our industries while benefiting our adversaries. Trade deficits reflect that imbalance, but they also reveal something deeper: the strength of the American consumer. It’s time we stopped allowing that strength to be used against us and started putting American workers first.”\nRep. Riley Moore: “For decades, foreign countries have enjoyed free access to the greatest consumer marketplace on the face of the planet, all while still charging our domestic producers hefty duties or imposing significant barriers to access their markets. Today that ends. President Trump is the only president in my lifetime to acknowledge how unfair trade has gutted the heartland and shipped countless jobs overseas. By finally reciprocating in-kind, we’ll force foreign competitors to the negotiating table, lower trade barriers, and ultimately create real free and fair trade across the board. I’m confident this move will boost our domestic manufacturing industry and fuel demand for American products across the globe.”\nRep. Tim Moore: “President Trump is leveling the playing field for American workers and bringing back MADE IN AMERICA!”\nRep. Troy Nehls: “President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs make it clear that our country will not be ripped off anymore. We are bringing back American manufacturing and putting America First.”\nRep. Ralph Norman: “Happy LIBERATION Day … ✅Protect the American worker ✅Strengthen manufacturing ✅Reduce unfair trade practices … Our economy will be competitive again!!”\nRep. Andy Ogles: “He’s resetting the negotiating table. He’s resetting the deck here to say, ‘You know what? For too long, you’ve taken advantage of our free market and you’ve literally leached jobs away from the American people … Let’s have a serious conversation and let’s do something that’s fair and mutually beneficial for both sides.’”\nRep. Guy Reschenthaler: “I fully support President Trump’s critical efforts to right this generational wrong, bring manufacturing jobs home, and rejuvenate American working families. Made in America is back.”\nRep. John Rutherford: “Tariffs help bring American jobs back home, incentivize buying American, AND put pressure on Canada and Mexico to stop the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants from their countries into ours. Even the Biden Admin kept or increased tariffs that President Trump imposed during his first presidency. Under Trump, inflation stayed around 2% and our GDP grew to 3%. Smart tariffs are a long-term investment in the American economy that are worth the short-term cost.”\nRep. Adrian Smith: “Reducing trade barriers is necessary to ensuring American farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, small businesses, and innovators can sell their products in other markets. President Trump has made it clear other countries can avoid tariffs by reducing or eliminating their existing barriers to U.S. products. Engagement on trade is vital to our economy and opportunity for U.S. workers. In his first term, President Trump proved robust engagement can be productive as he moved the ball down the field on several agreements with our top trade partners. To achieve economic stability, we must continue to fight to give our producers the chance to compete in a global marketplace.”\nRep. Greg Steube: “What many fail to realize: Trump’s reciprocal tariffs are a long-overdue response to years of unfair trade policies against America. For decades, America has been ripped off by other countries who have repeatedly slapped tariffs on our goods, blocked our products, and flooded our markets with theirs. The numbers don’t lie–the rest of the world has profited at the expense of American workers and businesses. President Trump is finally putting America First by taking bold, necessary actions that past leaders wouldn’t take.”\nRep. Marlin Stutzman: “If Australia doesn’t want our beef – WE DON’T WANT THEIRS! Thank you @POTUS for opening the door of fair treatment for America’s Cattlemen‼️”\nRep. Tom Tiffany: “Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of by foreign countries. The American worker comes FIRST.”\nRep. William Timmons: “President Trump’s tariffs are a necessary move to protect American workers and rebuild our economy. We are finally breaking free from decades of unfair trade deals that gutted our industries. These tariffs will bring jobs back to our districts, strengthen manufacturing, and ensure our children inherit a country that is not just a consumer, but a producer. Thank you, @POTUS.”\nRep. Beth Van Duyne: “For far too long, the United States has been taken advantage of by our foreign trade partners. The American people re-elected President Trump to bring back truly fair trade with other countries. Reciprocal tariffs are a first step to have a level playing field for American products and to start bringing back manufacturing to our country!”\nRep. Daniel Webster: “President @realDonaldTrump is delivering on his mandate to restore America’s economic strength. For too long, unfair trade deals have hollowed out our factories and shipped American jobs overseas. By standing up to bad actors like China and Venezuela and enforcing fair trade, President Trump is defending American industries and putting American workers first.”\nRep. Tony Wied: “President Trump has made it clear with these reciprocal tariffs that we will no longer allow other countries to take advantage of us. His goal is simple: to bring jobs and manufacturing back to our country and open up foreign markets to American products. If companies want to avoid these tariffs, they will do business in the United States. I applaud the President for taking a stand against years of unfair trade practices and making sure we put American workers and consumers first. It’s time our foreign trading partners finally live up to their end of the bargain.”\nRep. Roger Williams: “For too long, America Last policies have put the U.S. auto industry at a disadvantage. As a car dealer and small business owner, I support @POTUS’ Executive Order to increase competition, boost revenue, and bring back American jobs.”\nMississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce Andy Gipson: “I applaud President Trump’s actions today to reset global trade relations through the President’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariff plan. America is not only in a trade war, we’ve been in a trade war for years now. This trade war has resulted in historic trade deficits that continue to hurt our farmers. … I believe President Trump’s actions today will set the stage for the renegotiation of better trade deals that will benefit American farmers and all our domestic industries going forward and will also serve to spur more local production.”\nU.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer: “Today, President Trump is taking urgent action to protect the national security and economy of the United States. The current lack of trade reciprocity, demonstrated by our chronic trade deficit, has weakened our economic and national security. After only 72 days in office, President Trump has prioritized swift action to bring reciprocity to our trade relations and reduce the trade deficit by leveling the playing field for American workers and manufacturers, reshoring American jobs, expanding our domestic manufacturing base, and ensuring our defense-industrial base is not dependent on foreign adversaries—all leading to stronger economic and national security.”\nSecretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick: “Today, the world starts taking us seriously. Our workforce will finally be treated fairly.”\nSecretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent: “President Trump signed the Declaration of Economic Independence for the American people. For decades, the trade status quo has allowed countries to leverage tariffs and unfair trade practices to get ahead at the expense of hardworking Americans. The President’s historic actions will level the playing field for American workers and usher in a new age of economic strength.”\nSecretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins: “FARMERS COME FIRST — @POTUS is leveling the playing field, ensuring American farmers and ranchers can compete globally again!”\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio: “Thank you, @POTUS! ‘Made in America’ is not just a tagline — it’s an economic and national security priority.”\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem: “For too long, America has been targeted by unfair trade practices that made our supply chain dependent on foreign adversaries, eroded our industrial base, and hurt American workers. This has gravely impacted our national security. President Trump’s strong action will help make America safe again. @DHS, primarily through @CBP, is ready to collect these new tariffs and put an end to unfair trade practices. Thank you President @realDonaldTrump for putting America FIRST.”\nSecretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer: “Promises made, promises kept”\nSecretary of Energy Chris Wright: “President Trump is a businessman; he’s a negotiator. The result of that has been and will continue to be improvements for the American people. We are in the midst of a negotiation, and he is fighting every day to make the cost-of-living conditions better for Americans.”\nSecretary of Education Linda McMahon: “At the White House this afternoon, we celebrated Liberation Day — setting our economy on the path of future prosperity for our children. Business owners, workers, and taxpayers have been waiting for strong economic leadership.\n@POTUS’ actions today prove we are done being taken advantage of in international trade.”\nSecretary of the Interior Doug Burgum: “President Trump’s Liberation Day reciprocity plan is commonsense. If you tariff us, we’ll tariff you. This will strengthen our economy and make America wealthy again!”\nSecretary of Transportation Sean Duffy: “Today is the day we will liberate ourselves from unfair trade practices and outdated ways of thinking. Tariffs are an important tool in the President’s toolbox to stop foreign countries from ripping us off, protect America’s workers, and restore U.S. manufacturing. I stand with @POTUS as he finally levels the playing field. Happy Liberation Day!”\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development Scott Turner: “For four years, Americans couldn’t afford groceries, let alone a house. This Liberation Day, @POTUS is bringing manufacturing and jobs back. President Trump is making the American Dream achievable again!”\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin: “Massive announcement by @POTUS today restoring U.S. dominance, cementing his America First vision, and Powering the Great American Comeback.”\nSmall Business Administration Administrator Kelly Loeffler: “Small businesses will no longer be crushed by foreign governments and unfair trade deals. Instead, we will put American industry, workers, and strength FIRST. Thank you @POTUS for bringing back Made in America!”\nNational Security Advisor Mike Waltz: “Economic security is national security. Thank you President Trump for putting America first.”"

    "content": "Today, President Donald J. Trump made clear to the world that the days of economic surrender are over. After being sold out by career politicians for generations, President Trump is enacting fair trade policies that will restore our workforce, rebuild our economy, and finally put America First.\nThe move drew immediate praise:\nCoalition for a Prosperous America Chairman Zach Mottl: “A permanent, universal baseline tariff resets the global trade environment and finally addresses the destructive legacy of decades of misguided free-trade policies. President Trump’s decision to implement a baseline tariff is a game-changing shift that prioritizes American manufacturing, protects working-class jobs, and safeguards our economic security from adversaries like China. This is exactly the type of bold action America needs to restore its industrial leadership. Today’s action will deliver lasting benefits to the U.S. economy and working-class Americans, cementing President Trump’s legacy as one that ushered in a new Golden Age of American industrialization and prosperity.”National Cattlemen’s Beef Association SVP of Government Affairs Ethan Lane: “For too long, America’s family farmers and ranchers have been mistreated by certain trading partners around the world. President Trump is taking action to address numerous trade barriers that prevent consumers overseas from enjoying high-quality, wholesome American beef. NCBA will continue engaging with the White House to ensure fair treatment for America’s cattle producers around the world and optimize opportunities for exports abroad.”Steel Manufacturers Association President Philip K. Bell: “President Trump is a champion of the domestic steel industry, and his America First Trade Policy is designed to fight the unfair trade that has harmed American workers and weakened manufacturing in the United States. The recently reinvigorated 232 steel tariffs have already started creating American jobs and bolstering the domestic steel industry. President Trump is working to turn America into a manufacturing powerhouse and the steel tariffs are driving that movement. President Trump’s initial 232 steel tariffs and the historic tax cuts led to investments of nearly $20 billion by steel manufacturers in the United States. Since the revised tariffs took effect, Hyundai Steel announced a $5.8 billion steel mill in Louisiana, demonstrating that the tariffs are working to bring more steel investments and production to the United States. The domestic steel market is stronger when other nations are forced to compete on a level playing field. On a level playing field, American workers can outcompete anyone. We look forward to continuing working with President Trump and his administration to ensure a level playing field for Americans and a robust domestic steel industry that strengthens our national, economic and energy security.”Alliance for American Manufacturing President Scott Paul: “Today’s trade action prioritizes domestic manufacturers and America’s workers. These hardworking men and women have seen unfair trade cut the ground from beneath their feet for decades. They deserve a fighting chance. Our workers can out-compete anyone in the world, but they need a level playing field to do it. This trade reset is a necessary step in the right direction.”National Electrical Contractors Association CEO David Long: “President Trump has consistently prioritized policies that put the electrical industry as a priority, and we recognize his commitment to strengthening our nation’s economy. As these new tariffs take effect, we look forward to working with the Administration to ensure that electrical contractors and the entire electrical industry can continue powering America efficiently while navigating potential cost and supply chain challenges.”Bienvenido Empresarios: “As an organization committed to empowering Hispanic Americans and strengthening our nation’s future, Bienvenido supports policies that build a more resilient American economy, safeguard our communities, and reassert U.S. leadership on the global stage. President Trump’s emphasis on using economic leverage — including tariffs — reflects a broader strategy to counter China, confront the deadly fentanyl crisis, and bring critical industries back home. Now is a time for tough, decisive action when national security and American livelihoods are at stake. Our hope is that these measures lead to stronger enforcement, fairer trade, and long-term prosperity for all Americans.”America First Policy Institute: “Tariffs worked then—and they’ll work again. Under President Trump, tariffs brought back jobs, lowered inflation, and strengthened national security. It’s not just economic policy—it’s America First in action.”Speaker Mike Johnson: “President Trump is sending a clear message with Liberation Day: America will not be exploited by unfair trade practices anymore. These tariffs restore fair and reciprocal trade and level the playing field for American workers and innovators. The President understands that FREE trade ONLY works when it’s FAIR!”Gov. Jeff Landry: “Pro Jobs. Pro Business. Pro America.”Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso: “President Trump is acting boldly to put America first. America needs fair and free trade. We can’t allow other countries to keep abusing our workers and job creators. It’s time we had a level playing field. I applaud President Trump’s 100% commitment to Made in America.”Sen. Jim Banks: “The decision by President Trump today to impose reciprocal tariffs will be so good for Indiana. … Those are the manufacturing jobs that President Trump is bringing back from overseas.”Sen. Bill Cassidy: “The president’s trade agenda can pave the way for stronger trade deals, fairer rules, and real results. I am excited to work with President Trump to make it happen. Louisiana’s workers and families deserve nothing less.”Sen. Roger Marshall: “President Donald Trump is fighting for long-term solutions to put America’s farmers and ranchers first.”Sen. Ashley Moody: “It’s liberation day in America! Today, @POTUS sent a message to the world that the era of America being taken advantage of is over.”Sen. Markwayne Mullin: “President Trump is going to charge foreign countries roughly half of what they *already* charge us to do business. Literally who can argue with this?”Sen. Pete Ricketts: “President Trump is delivering on his campaign promises to level the playing field and stand up for the American people. Reciprocal tariffs will ensure equal treatment for American businesses. @POTUS is working to reshore jobs lost overseas and secure our supply chains. He is working to open new markets for our nation’s agriculture products. He is demonstrating to foreign adversaries like China that we will no longer be taken advantage of.”Sen. Rick Scott: “The days of the U.S. being taken advantage of by other countries are OVER! Pres. Trump is making it clear that he will ALWAYS put American jobs, manufacturing and our economy first. As Americans, let’s stand with him and support one another by buying products MADE IN AMERICA.”Sen. Eric Schmitt: “President Trump is bringing America back. We won’t be ripped off by other countries anymore. We’re bringing back manufacturing, unleashing energy production, and paving the way for prosperity.”Sen. Tommy Tuberville: “For too long, other countries have ripped us off with bad trade deals – resulting in American jobs and manufacturing moving overseas. But change is coming. The Golden Age of America’s economy is here. Happy Liberation Day.”House Majority Leader Steve Scalise: “The United States and American workers will no longer be ripped off by other countries with unfair trade practices.

President @realDonaldTrump says NO MORE.”House Republican Conference Chairwoman Lisa McClain: “Tariffs work! @POTUS has proven tariffs are an effective tool in achieving economic and strategic objectives. The President’s long-term strategy will pay off.”Rep. Elise Stefanik: “I strongly support President Trump’s America First economic policies to strengthen American manufacturing and create millions of American jobs. For too long, Americans have suffered under unfair trade practices putting America Last. We will not allow other countries to take advantage of us and we must put America and the American worker first.”\nRep. Jason Smith: “America shouldn’t reward countries that discriminate against American workers and manufacturers. On Liberation Day, President Trump is correcting this and demanding fair treatment for American producers.”Rep. Mark Alford: “The days of the United States being taken advantage of are OVER. Republicans are putting American workers FIRST.”Rep. Jodey Arrington: “For too long, our leaders have allowed other nations to rip us off through numerous unfair trade practices resulting in suppressed wages, lost opportunities, and unrealized economic growth. Just as he did in his first term, President Trump is fighting to ensure an even playing field for our manufacturers, farmers, and workers so we can unleash American prosperity and Make America Great Again.”Rep. Brian Babin: “Trump’s tariffs aren’t starting a trade war—they’re ending one. For decades, other countries ripped off American workers with unfair tariffs and barriers. Now, we’re finally fighting back.”Rep. Andy Biggs: “Past administrations have allowed the United States to be ripped off by allies and adversaries alike. President Trump said “NO MORE!” The Art of the Deal.”Rep. Vern Buchanan: “For too long, unfair trade practices devastated America’s manufacturing base and stole millions of blue-collar jobs. It’s time to level the playing field and bring those jobs back. @POTUS is fighting for American workers.”Rep. Michael Cloud: “America-First means putting the American people first. We will no longer be taken advantage of as a nation and people.”Rep. Andrew Clyde: “For far too long, the U.S. has been ripped off by countries across the globe with unfair trade practices. Now, we’re finally leveling the playing field. THANK YOU, President Trump, for putting American workers and manufacturing FIRST.”Rep. Mike Collins: “This is fair. Whether it’s our military or economy, other countries have taken advantage of the U.S. for far too long. That time is over.”Rep. Chuck Edwards: “Many countries are taking advantage of the United States by imposing tariffs against us while we don’t have reciprocal tariffs against them. @POTUS has used tariffs to produce successful trade deals for us in his first term, and I support his plan to use them again to create a more level playing field and secure fairer trade deals for America. The quicker other countries agree to fairer trade deals, the quicker the tariffs can end.”\nRep. Scott Franklin:“For years the US handcuffed itself and played nice while other countries imposed massive tariffs and took advantage of us. We’re done putting America last. @POTUS is leveling the playing field, ending trade imbalances and prioritizing American workers and manufacturing again!”\nRep. Russell Fry: “HAPPY LIBERATION DAY. Thanks to @POTUS, America is DONE being taken advantage of. A new era has begun.”Rep. Lance Gooden: “For decades, Washington allowed Texans to be ripped off by foreign countries. Those days are now over. @POTUS is committed to making America wealthy again!”Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene: “If you want to do business in America, you need to play by our rules. For too long, American businesses, big and small, have been ripped off by bad trade deals and unfair competition. President Trump is putting a stop to it. He’s standing up for our workers, our companies, and our consumers.”Rep. Abe Hamadeh: “The America First Republican party is the party of the working class, the forgotten men and women. On this Liberation Day, we further our commitment to them, that we will reshore our manufacturing, restore fair trade, and rebuild the greatest economy in the world.”\nRep. Pat Harrigan:“If you want access to the most powerful economy in the world, treat us fairly. If not, don’t expect a free ride. That’s real leadership and @POTUS is delivering it!”Rep.

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:Section 1.  Purpose.  Many shippers based in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices.  These shippers often avoid detection due to administration of the de minimis exemption under section 321(a)(2)(C) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C)).As noted in Executive Order 14195 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties to Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China), as amended by Executive Order 14228 of March 3, 2025 (Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China), these exports play a significant role in the synthetic opioid crisis in the United States.  In Executive Order 14200 of February 5, 2025 (Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China), I suspended the elimination of duty-free de minimis treatment on articles described in section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195.  The Secretary of Commerce has notified me that adequate systems are now in place to process and collect tariff revenue for covered goods from the PRC otherwise eligible for duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C).  Accordingly, duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) shall no longer be available for products of the PRC (which include products of Hong Kong) described in section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228, including international postal packages sent to the United States through the international postal network from the PRC or Hong Kong, that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025.  Additional duties for such imported merchandise shall be collected at the rates described in this order.Sec. 2.  Assessment of Duties on Low-Value Products of the PRC.  (a)  Other than articles sent to the United States through the international postal network (for which a duty is separately provided as described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section), all shipments of articles described in section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228, that are products of the PRC or Hong Kong; that are sent to the United States; that are valued at or under 800 dollars and that would otherwise qualify for the de minimis exemption authorized in 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C); and that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025, shall be entered by a party qualified to make entry under another appropriate entry type in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security, with all applicable duties, including those imposed by section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228, and paid in accordance with the applicable entry and payment procedures.  Executive departments and agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, through CBP, shall take all necessary actions to effectuate the objectives of this order, consistent with applicable law, including through temporary suspension or amendment of regulations or notices in the Federal Register.  The United States International Trade Commission shall continue to act ministerially by modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), as needed, to reflect the actions set out in this order.\n(b)  Imposition of Duty.\n(i)    All postal items containing goods described in section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195 and sent to the United States through the international postal network from the PRC or Hong Kong and transported by carriers that are valued at or under 800 dollars and that would otherwise qualify for the de minimis exemption authorized in 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) shall be subject to the duties described in subsection (c) of this section.  In order to address the threat of the PRC’s failure to act to blunt the sustained influx of synthetic opioids into the United States, while allowing for the orderly flow of legitimate international mail, the duties imposed in subsection (c) of this section, except as required by applicable law, are imposed in lieu of any other duties that the shipments would otherwise be subject to, including the 20 percent ad valorem duty established in Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228; most-favored nation rates embodied in the HTSUS; and duties imposed pursuant to section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.\n(ii)   CBP is authorized to require the carrier transporting the international postal package into the United States to remit payment of the duty described in subsection (c) of this section to CBP monthly or on such other periodic time frame as CBP determines appropriate, and CBP may issue regulations and guidance as necessary or appropriate to implement and enforce this requirement.\n(iii)  All carriers that transport international postal packages from the PRC or Hong Kong to the United States as part of or on behalf of the international postal network must report to CBP the total number of postal items containing goods and, if electing the duty rate specified in subsection (c)(i) of this section, the value of each postal item containing goods, transported per conveyance, in a timeframe and manner prescribed by CBP.  CBP may require submission of documentation and information from the carrier to verify the total number and value of individual postal items containing goods to be electronically transmitted through the ACE.\n(c)  Duty Rates.  Transportation carriers delivering shipments to the United States from the PRC or Hong Kong sent through the international postal network must collect and remit duties to CBP under the approach outlined in either subsection (c)(i) or subsection (c)(ii) of this section.  Transportation carriers must apply the same duty collection methodology to all shipments; however, transportation carriers may change their collection methodology once a month or on such other periodic timeframe as CBP determines appropriate, upon providing 24-hour notice to CBP.\n(i)   Ad Valorem Duty.  30 percent of the value of the postal item containing goods for merchandise entered for consumption on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025.\n(ii)  Specific Duty.  25 dollars per postal item containing goods for merchandise entered for consumption on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025, and before 12:01 am eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025, and 50 dollars per postal item containing goods for merchandise entered for consumption on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025.\n(d)  Bond Requirement.  Any carrier that transports international postal items containing goods from the PRC or Hong Kong to the United States, by any mode of transportation, must have an international carrier bond to ensure payment of the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.  CBP is authorized to ensure that the international carrier bonds required by this subsection are sufficient to account for the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.\n(e)  Discretion to Require Formal Entry.  CBP may require formal entry, in accordance with existing regulations, for any international postal package that may otherwise be subject to the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.  An international postal package for which CBP requires formal entry will not be subject to the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, and instead will be subject to all applicable duties, taxes, and fees in accordance with all applicable laws.Sec. 3.  Implementation of Duty.  The Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to take all necessary actions to implement this order.  Consistent with section 4 of Executive Order 14195, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce, is authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order.Sec. 4.  Homeland Security Authorities.  Nothing in this order limits the ability of the Department of Homeland Security to use any available legal authorities granted to ensure compliance with the provisions of this order.Sec. 5.  Monitoring.  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall submit a report to the President regarding the impact of this order on American industries, consumers, and supply chains and making recommendations for further action as he deems necessary, including a recommendation on whether extending de minimis ineligibility to packages from Macau is necessary to prevent circumvention of this order.Sec. 6.  General Provisions. (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)(NEA), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that underlying conditions, including a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’ economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption, as indicated by large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.  That threat has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States in the domestic economic policies of key trading partners and structural imbalances in the global trading system.  I hereby declare a national emergency with respect to this threat.On January 20, 2025, I signed the America First Trade Policy Presidential Memorandum directing my Administration to investigate the causes of our country’s large and persistent annual trade deficits in goods, including the economic and national security implications and risks resulting from such deficits, and to undertake a review of, and identify, any unfair trade practices by other countries.  On February 13, 2025, I signed a Presidential Memorandum entitled “Reciprocal Trade and Tariffs,” that directed further review of our trading partners’ non-reciprocal trading practices, and noted the relationship between non-reciprocal practices and the trade deficit.  On April 1, 2025, I received the final results of those investigations, and I am taking action today based on those results.  Large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits have led to the hollowing out of our manufacturing base; inhibited our ability to scale advanced domestic manufacturing capacity; undermined critical supply chains; and rendered our defense-industrial base dependent on foreign adversaries.  Large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits are caused in substantial part by a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships.  This situation is evidenced by disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers that make it harder for U.S. manufacturers to sell their products in foreign markets.  It is also evidenced by the economic policies of key U.S. trading partners insofar as they suppress domestic wages and consumption, and thereby demand for U.S. exports, while artificially increasing the competitiveness of their goods in global markets.  These conditions have given rise to the national emergency that this order is intended to abate and resolve.For decades starting in 1934, U.S. trade policy has been organized around the principle of reciprocity.  The Congress directed the President to secure reduced reciprocal tariff rates from key trading partners first through bilateral trade agreements and later under the auspices of the global trading system.  Between 1934 and 1945, the executive branch negotiated and signed 32 bilateral reciprocal trade agreements designed to lower tariff rates on a reciprocal basis.  After 1947 through 1994, participating countries engaged in eight rounds of negotiation, which resulted in the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and seven subsequent tariff reduction rounds. However, despite a commitment to the principle of reciprocity, the trading relationship between the United States and its trading partners has become highly unbalanced, particularly in recent years.  The post-war international economic system was based upon three incorrect assumptions:  first, that if the United States led the world in liberalizing tariff and non-tariff barriers the rest of the world would follow; second, that such liberalization would ultimately result in more economic convergence and increased domestic consumption among U.S. trading partners converging towards the share in the United States; and third, that as a result, the United States would not accrue large and persistent goods trade deficits. This framework set in motion events, agreements, and commitments that did not result in reciprocity or generally increase domestic consumption in foreign economies relative to domestic consumption in the United States.  Those events, in turn, created large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits as a feature of the global trading system. Put simply, while World Trade Organization (WTO) Members agreed to bind their tariff rates on a most-favored-nation (MFN) basis, and thereby provide their best tariff rates to all WTO Members, they did not agree to bind their tariff rates at similarly low levels or to apply tariff rates on a reciprocal basis.  Consequently, according to the WTO, the United States has among the lowest simple average MFN tariff rates in the world at 3.3 percent, while many of our key trading partners like Brazil (11.2 percent), China (7.5 percent), the European Union (EU) (5 percent), India (17 percent), and Vietnam (9.4 percent) have simple average MFN tariff rates that are significantly higher.  Moreover, these average MFN tariff rates conceal much larger discrepancies across economies in tariff rates applied to particular products.  For example, the United States imposes a 2.5 percent tariff on passenger vehicle imports (with internal combustion engines), while the European Union (10 percent), India (70 percent), and China (15 percent) impose much higher duties on the same product.  For network switches and routers, the United States imposes a 0 percent tariff, but for similar products, India (10 percent) levies a higher rate.  Brazil (18 percent) and Indonesia (30 percent) impose a higher tariff on ethanol than does the United States (2.5 percent).  For rice in the husk, the U.S. MFN tariff is 2.7 percent (ad valorem equivalent), while India (80 percent), Malaysia (40 percent), and Turkey (an average of 31 percent) impose higher rates.  Apples enter the United States duty-free, but not so in Turkey (60.3 percent) and India (50 percent).Similarly, non-tariff barriers also deprive U.S. manufacturers of reciprocal access to markets around the world.  The 2025 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers (NTE) details a great number of non-tariff barriers to U.S. exports around the world on a trading-partner by trading-partner basis.  These barriers include import barriers and licensing restrictions; customs barriers and shortcomings in trade facilitation; technical barriers to trade (e.g., unnecessarily trade restrictive standards, conformity assessment procedures, or technical regulations); sanitary and phytosanitary measures that unnecessarily restrict trade without furthering safety objectives; inadequate patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark regimes and inadequate enforcement of intellectual property rights; discriminatory licensing requirements or regulatory standards; barriers to cross-border data flows and discriminatory practices affecting trade in digital products; investment barriers; subsidies; anticompetitive practices; discrimination in favor of domestic state-owned enterprises, and failures by governments in protecting labor and environment standards; bribery; and corruption.Moreover, non-tariff barriers include the domestic economic policies and practices of our trading partners, including currency practices and value-added taxes, and their associated market distortions, that suppress domestic consumption and boost exports to the United States.  This lack of reciprocity is apparent in the fact that the share of consumption to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the United States is about 68 percent, but it is much lower in others like Ireland (27 percent), Singapore (31 percent), China (39 percent), South Korea (49 percent), and Germany (50 percent).At the same time, efforts by the United States to address these imbalances have stalled.  Trading partners have repeatedly blocked multilateral and plurilateral solutions, including in the context of new rounds of tariff negotiations and efforts to discipline non-tariff barriers.  At the same time, with the U.S. economy disproportionately open to imports, U.S. trading partners have had few incentives to provide reciprocal treatment to U.S. exports in the context of bilateral trade negotiations.These structural asymmetries have driven the large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficit.  Even for countries with which the United States may enjoy an occasional bilateral trade surplus, the accumulation of tariff and non-tariff barriers on U.S. exports may make that surplus smaller than it would have been without such barriers.  Permitting these asymmetries to continue is not sustainable in today’s economic and geopolitical environment because of the effect they have on U.S. domestic production.  A nation’s ability to produce domestically is the bedrock of its national and economic security.Both my first Administration in 2017, and the Biden Administration in 2022, recognized that increasing domestic manufacturing is critical to U.S. national security.  According to 2023 United Nations data, U.S. manufacturing output as a share of global manufacturing output was 17.4 percent, down from a peak in 2001 of 28.4 percent. Over time, the persistent decline in U.S. manufacturing output has reduced U.S. manufacturing capacity.  The need to maintain robust and resilient domestic manufacturing capacity is particularly acute in certain advanced industrial sectors like automobiles, shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, technology products, machine tools, and basic and fabricated metals, because once competitors gain sufficient global market share in these sectors, U.S. production could be permanently weakened.  It is also critical to scale manufacturing capacity in the defense-industrial sector so that we can manufacture the defense materiel and equipment necessary to protect American interests at home and abroad.  In fact, because the United States has supplied so much military equipment to other countries, U.S. stockpiles of military goods are too low to be compatible with U.S. national defense interests.  Furthermore, U.S. defense companies must develop new, advanced manufacturing technologies across a range of critical sectors including bio-manufacturing, batteries, and microelectronics.  If the United States wishes to maintain an effective security umbrella to defend its citizens and homeland, as well as for its allies and partners, it needs to have a large upstream manufacturing and goods-producing ecosystem to manufacture these products without undue reliance on imports for key inputs. Increased reliance on foreign producers for goods also has compromised U.S. economic security by rendering U.S. supply chains vulnerable to geopolitical disruption and supply shocks.  In recent years, the vulnerability of the U.S. economy in this respect was exposed both during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Americans had difficulty accessing essential products, as well as when the Houthi rebels later began attacking cargo ships in the Middle East. The decline of U.S. manufacturing capacity threatens the U.S. economy in other ways, including through the loss of manufacturing jobs.  From 1997 to 2024, the United States lost around 5 million manufacturing jobs and experienced one of the largest drops in manufacturing employment in history.  Furthermore, many manufacturing job losses were concentrated in specific geographical areas.  In these areas, the loss of manufacturing jobs contributed to the decline in rates of family formation and to the rise of other social trends, like the abuse of opioids, that have imposed profound costs on the U.S. economy.The future of American competitiveness depends on reversing these trends.  Today, manufacturing represents just 11 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, yet it accounts for 35 percent of American productivity growth and 60 percent of our exports.  Importantly, U.S. manufacturing is the main engine of innovation in the United States, responsible for 55 percent of all patents and 70 percent of all research and development (R&D) spending.  The fact that R&D expenditures by U.S. multinational enterprises in China grew at an average rate of 13.6 percent a year between 2003 and 2017, while their R&D expenditures in the United States grew by an average of just 5 percent per year during the same time period, is evidence of the strong link between manufacturing and innovation.  Furthermore, every manufacturing job spurs 7 to 12 new jobs in other related industries, helping to build and sustain our economy.Just as a nation that does not produce manufactured products cannot maintain the industrial base it needs for national security, neither can a nation long survive if it cannot produce its own food.  Presidential Policy Directive 21 of February 12, 2013 (Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience), designates food and agriculture as a “critical infrastructure sector” because it is one of the sectors considered “so vital to the United States that [its] incapacity or destruction . . . would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.”  Furthermore, when I left office, the United States had a trade surplus in agricultural products, but today, that surplus has vanished.  Eviscerated by a slew of new non-tariff barriers imposed by our trading partners, it has been replaced by a projected $49 billion annual agricultural trade deficit. For these reasons, I hereby declare and order:Section 1.  National Emergency.  As President of the United States, my highest duty is ensuring the national and economic security of the country and its citizens.  I have declared a national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, which have grown by over 40 percent in the past 5 years alone, reaching $1.2 trillion in 2024.  This trade deficit reflects asymmetries in trade relationships that have contributed to the atrophy of domestic production capacity, especially that of the U.S. manufacturing and defense-industrial base.  These asymmetries also impact U.S. producers’ ability to export and, consequentially, their incentive to produce. Specifically, such asymmetry includes not only non-reciprocal differences in tariff rates among foreign trading partners, but also extensive use of non-tariff barriers by foreign trading partners, which reduce the competitiveness of U.S. exports while artificially enhancing the competitiveness of their own goods.  These non-tariff barriers include technical barriers to trade; non-scientific sanitary and phytosanitary rules; inadequate intellectual property protections; suppressed domestic consumption (e.g., wage suppression); weak labor, environmental, and other regulatory standards and protections; and corruption.  These non-tariff barriers give rise to significant imbalances even when the United States and a trading partner have comparable tariff rates. The cumulative effect of these imbalances has been the transfer of resources from domestic producers to foreign firms, reducing opportunities for domestic manufacturers to expand and, in turn, leading to lost manufacturing jobs, diminished manufacturing capacity, and an atrophied industrial base, including in the defense-industrial sector.  At the same time, foreign firms are better positioned to scale production, reinvest in innovation, and compete in the global economy, to the detriment of U.S. economic and national security.  The absence of sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity in certain critical and advanced industrial sectors — another outcome of the large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits — also compromises U.S. economic and national security by rendering the U.S. economy less resilient to supply chain disruption.  Finally, the large, persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, and the concomitant loss of industrial capacity, have compromised military readiness; this vulnerability can only be redressed through swift corrective action to rebalance the flow of imports into the United States.  Such impact upon military readiness and our national security posture is especially acute with the recent rise in armed conflicts abroad.  I call upon the public and private sector to make the efforts necessary to strengthen the international economic position of the United States.  Sec. 2.  Reciprocal Tariff Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to rebalance global trade flows by imposing an additional ad valorem duty on all imports from all trading partners except as otherwise provided herein.  The additional ad valorem duty on all imports from all trading partners shall start at 10 percent and shortly thereafter, the additional ad valorem duty shall increase for trading partners enumerated in Annex I to this order at the rates set forth in Annex I to this order.  These additional ad valorem duties shall apply until such time as I determine that the underlying conditions described above are satisfied, resolved, or mitigated.   Sec. 3.  Implementation.  (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this order, all articles imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10 percent.  Such rates of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 5, 2025, except that goods loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 5, 2025, and entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 5, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty.  Furthermore, except as otherwise provided in this order, at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 9, 2025, all articles from trading partners enumerated in Annex I to this order imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be, consistent with law, subject to the country-specific ad valorem rates of duty specified in Annex I to this order.  Such rates of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 9, 2025, except that goods loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 9, 2025, and entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 9, 2025, shall not be subject to these country-specific ad valorem rates of duty set forth in Annex I to this order.  These country-specific ad valorem rates of duty shall apply to all articles imported pursuant to the terms of all existing U.S. trade agreements, except as provided below.\n(b)  The following goods as set forth in Annex II to this order, consistent with law, shall not be subject to the ad valorem rates of duty under this order:  (i) all articles that are encompassed by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b); (ii) all articles and derivatives of steel and aluminum subject to the duties imposed pursuant to section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), as amended, Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), as amended, and Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 2020 (Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and Derivative Steel Articles Into the United States), as amended, Proclamation 10895 of February 10, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), and Proclamation 10896 of February 10, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Steel into the United States); (iii) all automobiles and automotive parts subject to the additional duties imposed pursuant to section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, and proclaimed in Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States); (iv) other products enumerated in Annex II to this order, including copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber articles, certain critical minerals, and energy and energy products; (v) all articles from a trading partner subject to the rates set forth in Column 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS); and (vi) all articles that may become subject to duties pursuant to future actions under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.\n(c)  The rates of duty established by this order are in addition to any other duties, fees, taxes, exactions, or charges applicable to such imported articles, except as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section below.\n(d)  With respect to articles from Canada, I have imposed additional duties on certain goods to address a national emergency resulting from the flow of illicit drugs across our northern border pursuant to Executive Order 14193 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), as amended by Executive Order 14197 of February 3, 2025 (Progress on the Situation at Our Northern Border), and Executive Order 14231 of March 2, 2025 (Amendment to Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border).  With respect to articles from Mexico, I have imposed additional duties on certain goods to address a national emergency resulting from the flow of illicit drugs and illegal migration across our southern border pursuant to Executive Order 14194 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Situation at Our Southern Border), as amended by Executive Order 14198 of February 3, 2025 (Progress on the Situation at Our Southern Border), and Executive Order 14227 of March 2, 2025 (Amendment to Duties To Address the Situation at Our Southern Border).  As a result of these border emergency tariff actions, all goods of Canada or Mexico under the terms of general note 11 to the HTSUS, including any treatment set forth in subchapter XXIII of chapter 98 and subchapter XXII of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, as related to the Agreement between the United States of America, United Mexican States, and Canada (USMCA), continue to be eligible to enter the U.S. market under these preferential terms.  However, all goods of Canada or Mexico that do not qualify as originating under USMCA are presently subject to additional ad valorem duties of 25 percent, with energy or energy resources and potash imported from Canada and not qualifying as originating under USMCA presently subject to the lower additional ad valorem duty of 10 percent.\n(e)  Any ad valorem rate of duty on articles imported from Canada or Mexico under the terms of this order shall not apply in addition to the ad valorem rate of duty specified by the existing orders described in subsection (d) of this section.  If such orders identified in subsection (d) of this section are terminated or suspended, all items of Canada and Mexico that qualify as originating under USMCA shall not be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty, while articles not qualifying as originating under USMCA shall be subject to an ad valorem rate of duty of 12 percent.  However, these ad valorem rates of duty on articles imported from Canada and Mexico shall not apply to energy or energy resources, to potash, or to an article eligible for duty-free treatment under USMCA that is a part or component of an article substantially finished in the United States.\n(f)  More generally, the ad valorem rates of duty set forth in this order shall apply only to the non-U.S. content of a subject article, provided at least 20 percent of the value of the subject article is U.S. originating.  For the purposes of this subsection, “U.S. content” refers to the value of an article attributable to the components produced entirely, or substantially transformed in, the United States.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), to the extent permitted by law, is authorized to require the collection of such information and documentation regarding an imported article, including with the entry filing, as is necessary to enable CBP to

    "content": "CLOSING LOOPHOLES IN THE TARIFF SYSTEM: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order eliminating duty-free de minimis treatment for low-value imports from China, a critical step in countering the ongoing health emergency posed by the illicit flow of synthetic opioids into the U.S.\n- Following the Secretary of Commerce’s notification that adequate systems are in place to collect tariff revenue, President Trump is ending duty-free de minimis treatment for covered goods from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Hong Kong starting May 2, 2025 at 12:01 a.m. EDT.\n\nImported goods sent through means other than the international postal network that are valued at or under $800 and that would otherwise qualify for the de minimis exemption will be subject to all applicable duties, which shall be paid in accordance with applicable entry and payment procedures.\n\n\n\nAll relevant postal items containing goods that are sent through the international postal network that are valued at or under $800 and that would otherwise qualify for the de minimis exemption are subject to a duty rate of either 30% of their value or $25 per item (increasing to $50 per item after June 1, 2025). This is in lieu of any other duties, including those imposed by prior Orders.\n- Imported goods sent through means other than the international postal network that are valued at or under $800 and that would otherwise qualify for the de minimis exemption will be subject to all applicable duties, which shall be paid in accordance with applicable entry and payment procedures.\n- All relevant postal items containing goods that are sent through the international postal network that are valued at or under $800 and that would otherwise qualify for the de minimis exemption are subject to a duty rate of either 30% of their value or $25 per item (increasing to $50 per item after June 1, 2025). This is in lieu of any other duties, including those imposed by prior Orders.\n- Carriers transporting these postal items must report shipment details to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), maintain an international carrier bond to ensure duty payment, and remit duties to CBP on a set schedule.\n- CBP may require formal entry for any postal package instead of the specified duties.\n- The Secretary of Commerce will submit a report within 90 days assessing the Order’s impact and considering whether to extend these rules to packages from Macau.\nCOMBATING CHINA’S ROLE IN THE OPIOID CRISIS: President Trump is targeting deceptive shipping practices by Chinese-based shippers, many of whom hide illicit substances, including synthetic opioids, in low-value packages to exploit the de minimis exemption.\n- On average, CBP processes over 4 million de minimis shipments into the U.S. each day.\n- The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which exerts ultimate control over the government and enterprises of the PRC, has subsidized and otherwise incentivized PRC chemical companies to export fentanyl and related precursor chemicals that are used to produce synthetic opioids sold illicitly in the United States.\n- Many PRC-based chemical companies hide illicit substances in the flow of legitimate commerce, including through false invoices, fraudulent postage, and deceptive packaging.\n- While the U.S. previously offered a generous de minimis exemption, China enforces strict import restrictions and tightly limits de minimis exemptions, showing no similar leniency toward U.S. shipments.\n- Last fiscal year, CBP apprehended more than 21,000 pounds of fentanyl at our borders, enough fentanyl to kill more than 4 billion people.\n\nIt is estimated that federal officials are only able to seize a fraction of the fentanyl smuggled across the southern border.\n- It is estimated that federal officials are only able to seize a fraction of the fentanyl smuggled across the southern border.\n- These drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone.\n\nMore Americans are dying from fentanyl overdoses each year than the number of American lives lost in the entirety of the Vietnam War.\n- More Americans are dying from fentanyl overdoses each year than the number of American lives lost in the entirety of the Vietnam War.\nKEEPING HIS PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: When voters overwhelmingly elected Donald J. Trump as President, they gave him a mandate to seal the border and stop the influx of deadly drugs. That is exactly what he is doing.\n- On the campaign trail, President Trump promised “We will not rest until we have ended the drug addiction crisis.”\n- Upon returning to office, President Trump immediately took action to seal the border and crack down on drug trafficking.\n- President Trump implemented 20% tariffs on China to address the threat of the sustained influx of synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, flowing from China into the United States."

    "content": "PURSUING RECIPROCITY TO REBUILD THE ECONOMY AND RESTORE NATIONAL AND ECONOMIC SECURITY: Today, President Donald J. Trump declared that foreign trade and economic practices have created a national emergency, and his order imposes responsive tariffs to strengthen the international economic position of the United States and protect American workers.\n- Large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits have led to the hollowing out of our manufacturing base; resulted in a lack of incentive to increase advanced domestic manufacturing capacity; undermined critical supply chains; and rendered our defense-industrial base dependent on foreign adversaries.\n- President Trump is invoking his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to address the national emergency posed by the large and persistent trade deficit that is driven by the absence of reciprocity in our trade relationships and other harmful policies like currency manipulation and exorbitant value-added taxes (VAT) perpetuated by other countries.\n- Using his IEEPA authority, President Trump will impose a 10% tariff on all countries.\n\nThis will take effect April 5, 2025 at 12:01 a.m. EDT.\n- This will take effect April 5, 2025 at 12:01 a.m. EDT.\n- President Trump will impose an individualized reciprocal higher tariff on the countries with which the United States has the largest trade deficits. All other countries will continue to be subject to the original 10% tariff baseline.\n\nThis will take effect April 9, 2025 at 12:01 a.m. EDT.\n- This will take effect April 9, 2025 at 12:01 a.m. EDT.\n- These tariffs will remain in effect until such a time as President Trump determines that the threat posed by the trade deficit and underlying nonreciprocal treatment is satisfied, resolved, or mitigated.\n- Today’s IEEPA Order also contains modification authority, allowing President Trump to increase the tariff if trading partners retaliate or decrease the tariffs if trading partners take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align with the United States on economic and national security matters.\n- Some goods will not be subject to the Reciprocal Tariff. These include: (1) articles subject to 50 USC 1702(b); (2) steel/aluminum articles and autos/auto parts already subject to Section 232 tariffs; (3) copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber articles; (4) all articles that may become subject to future Section 232 tariffs; (5) bullion; and (6) energy and other certain minerals that are not available in the United States.\n- For Canada and Mexico, the existing fentanyl/migration IEEPA orders remain in effect, and are unaffected by this order. This means USMCA compliant goods will continue to see a 0% tariff, non-USMCA compliant goods will see a 25% tariff, and non-USMCA compliant energy and potash will see a 10% tariff. In the event the existing fentanyl/migration IEEPA orders are terminated, USMCA compliant goods would continue to receive preferential treatment, while non-USMCA compliant goods would be subject to a 12% reciprocal tariff.\nTAKING BACK OUR ECONOMIC SOVEREIGNTY: President Trump refuses to let the United States be taken advantage of and believes that tariffs are necessary to ensure fair trade, protect American workers, and reduce the trade deficit—this is an emergency.\n- He is the first President in modern history to stand strong for hardworking Americans by asking other countries to follow the golden rule on trade: Treat us like we treat you.\n- Pernicious economic policies and practices of our trading partners undermine our ability to produce essential goods for the public and the military, threatening national security.\n- U.S. companies, according to internal estimates, pay over $200 billion per year in value-added taxes (VAT) to foreign governments—a “double-whammy” on U.S. companies who pay the tax at the European border, while European companies don’t pay tax to the United States on the income from their exports to the U.S.\n- The annual cost to the U.S. economy of counterfeit goods, pirated software, and theft of trade secrets is between $225 billion and $600 billion. Counterfeit products not only pose a significant risk to U.S. competitiveness, but also threaten the security, health, and safety of Americans, with the global trade in counterfeit pharmaceuticals estimated at $4.4 billion and linked to the distribution of deadly fentanyl-laced drugs.\n\nThis imbalance has fueled a large and persistent trade deficit in both industrial and agricultural goods, led to offshoring of our manufacturing base, empowered non-market economies like China, and hurt America’s middle class and small towns. \n\n\n\nPresident Biden squandered the agricultural trade surplus inherited from President Trump’s first term, turning it into a projected all-time high deficit of $49 billion.\n- This imbalance has fueled a large and persistent trade deficit in both industrial and agricultural goods, led to offshoring of our manufacturing base, empowered non-market economies like China, and hurt America’s middle class and small towns.\n- President Biden squandered the agricultural trade surplus inherited from President Trump’s first term, turning it into a projected all-time high deficit of $49 billion.\n- The current global trading order allows those using unfair trade practices to get ahead, while those playing by the rules get left behind.\n- In 2024, our trade deficit in goods exceeded $1.2 trillion—an unsustainable crisis ignored by prior leadership.\n- “Made in America” is not just a tagline—it’s an economic and national security priority of this Administration. The President’s reciprocal trade agenda means better-paying American jobs making beautiful American-made cars, appliances, and other goods.\n- These tariffs seek to address the injustices of global trade, re-shore manufacturing, and drive economic growth for the American people.\n- Reciprocal trade is America First trade because it increases our competitive edge, protects our sovereignty, and strengthens our national and economic security.\n- These tariffs adjust for the unfairness of ongoing international trade practices, balance our chronic goods trade deficit, provide an incentive for re-shoring production to the United States, and provide our foreign trading partners with an opportunity to rebalance their trade relationships with the United States.\nREPRIORITIZING U.S. MANUFACTURING: President Trump recognizes that increasing domestic manufacturing is critical to U.S. national security.\n- In 2023, U.S. manufacturing output as a share of global manufacturing output was 17.4%, down from 28.4% in 2001.\n- The decline in manufacturing output has reduced U.S. manufacturing capacity.\n\nThe need to maintain a resilient domestic manufacturing capacity is particularly acute in advanced sectors like autos, shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, transport equipment, technology products, machine tools, and basic and fabricated metals, where loss of capacity could permanently weaken U.S. competitiveness.\n- The need to maintain a resilient domestic manufacturing capacity is particularly acute in advanced sectors like autos, shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, transport equipment, technology products, machine tools, and basic and fabricated metals, where loss of capacity could permanently weaken U.S. competitiveness.\n- U.S. stockpiles of military goods are too low to be compatible with U.S. national defense interests.\n\nIf the U.S. wishes to maintain an effective security umbrella to defend its citizens and homeland, as well as allies and partners, it needs to have a large upstream manufacturing and goods-producing ecosystem.\n\n\n\nThis includes developing new manufacturing technologies in critical sectors like bio-manufacturing, batteries, and microelectronics to support defense needs.\n- If the U.S. wishes to maintain an effective security umbrella to defend its citizens and homeland, as well as allies and partners, it needs to have a large upstream manufacturing and goods-producing ecosystem.\n- This includes developing new manufacturing technologies in critical sectors like bio-manufacturing, batteries, and microelectronics to support defense needs.\n- Increased reliance on foreign producers for goods has left the U.S. supply chain vulnerable to geopolitical disruption and supply shocks.\n\nThis vulnerability was exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and later with Houthi attacks on Middle East shipping.\n- This vulnerability was exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and later with Houthi attacks on Middle East shipping.\n- From 1997 to 2024, the U.S. lost around 5 million manufacturing jobs and experienced one of the largest drops in manufacturing employment in history.\nADDRESSING TRADE IMBALANCES: President Trump is working to level the playing field for American businesses and workers by confronting the unfair tariff disparities and non-tariff barriers imposed by other countries.\n- For generations, countries have taken advantage of the United States, tariffing us at higher rates. For example:\n\nThe United States imposes a 2.5% tariff on passenger vehicle imports (with internal combustion engines), while the European Union (10%) and India (70%) impose much higher duties on the same product. \n\n\n\nFor networking switches and routers, the United States imposes a 0% tariff, but India (10-20%) levies higher rates.\n\n\n\nBrazil (18%) and Indonesia (30%) impose a higher tariff on ethanol than does the United States (2.5%). \n\n\n\nFor rice in the husk, the U.S. imposes a tariff of 2.7%, while India (80%), Malaysia (40%), and Turkey (31%) impose higher rates. \n\n\n\nApples enter the United States duty-free, but not so in Turkey (60.3%) and India (50%).\n- The United States imposes a 2.5% tariff on passenger vehicle imports (with internal combustion engines), while the European Union (10%) and India (70%) impose much higher duties on the same product.\n- For networking switches and routers, the United States imposes a 0% tariff, but India (10-20%) levies higher rates.\n- Brazil (18%) and Indonesia (30%) impose a higher tariff on ethanol than does the United States (2.5%).\n- For rice in the husk, the U.S. imposes a tariff of 2.7%, while India (80%), Malaysia (40%), and Turkey (31%) impose higher rates.\n- Apples enter the United States duty-free, but not so in Turkey (60.3%) and India (50%).\n- The United States has one of the lowest simple average most-favored-nation (MFN) tariff rates in the world at 3.3%, while many of our key trading partners like Brazil (11.2%), China (7.5%), the European Union (5%), India (17%), and Vietnam (9.4%) have simple average MFN tariff rates that are significantly higher.\n- Similarly, non-tariff barriers—meant to limit the quantity of imports/exports and protect domestic industries—also deprive U.S. manufacturers of reciprocal access to markets around the world. For example:\n\nChina’s non-market policies and practices have given China global dominance in key manufacturing industries, decimating U.S. industry. Between 2001 and 2018, these practices contributed to the loss of 3.7 million U.S. jobs due to the growth of the U.S.-China trade deficit, displacing workers and undermining American competitiveness while threatening U.S. economic and national security by increasing our reliance on foreign-controlled supply chains for critical industries as well as everyday goods.\n\n\n\nIndia imposes their own uniquely burdensome and/or duplicative testing and certification requirements in sectors such as chemicals, telecom products, and medical devices that make it difficult or costly for American companies to sell their products in India. If these barriers were removed, it is estimated that U.S. exports would increase by at least $5.3 billion annually.\n\n\n\nCountries including China, Germany, Japan, and South Korea have pursued policies that suppress the domestic consumption power of their own citizens to artificially boost the competitiveness of their export products. Such policies include regressive tax systems, low or unenforced penalties for environmental degradation, and policies intended to suppress worker wages relative to productivity.\n\n\n\nCertain countries, like Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Vietnam, restrict or prohibit the importation of remanufactured goods, restricting market access for U.S. exporters while also stifling efforts to promote sustainability by discouraging trade in like-new and resource-efficient products. If these barriers were removed, it is estimated that U.S. exports would increase by at least $18 billion annually.\n\n\n\nThe UK maintains non-science-based standards that severely restrict U.S. exports of safe, high-quality beef and poultry products.\n\n\n\nIndonesia maintains local content requirements across a broad range of sectors, complex import licensing regimes, and, starting this year, will require natural resource firms to onshore all export revenue for transactions worth $250,000 or more.\n\n\n\nArgentina has banned imports of U.S. live cattle since 2002 due to unsubstantiated concerns regarding bovine spongiform encephalopathy.  The United States has a $223 million trade deficit with Argentina in beef and beef products.\n\n\n\nFor decades, South Africa has imposed animal health restrictions that are not scientifically justified on U.S. pork products, permitting a very limited list of U.S. pork exports to enter South Africa. South Africa also heavily restricts U.S. poultry exports through high tariffs, anti-dumping duties, and unjustified animal health restrictions. These barriers have contributed to a 78% decline in U.S. poultry exports to South Africa, from $89 million in 2019 to $19 million 2024.\n\n\n\nU.S. automakers face a variety of non-tariff barriers that impede access to the Japanese and Korean automotive markets, including non-acceptance of certain U.S. standards, duplicative testing and certification requirements, and transparency issues. Due to these non-reciprocal practices, the U.S. automotive industry loses out on an additional $13.5 billion in annual exports to Japan and access to a larger import market share in Korea—all while the U.S. trade deficit with Korea more than tripled from 2019 to 2024.\n- China’s non-market policies and practices have given China global dominance in key manufacturing industries, decimating U.S. industry. Between 2001 and 2018, these practices contributed to the loss of 3.7 million U.S. jobs due to the growth of the U.S.-China trade deficit, displacing workers and undermining American competitiveness while threatening U.S. economic and national security by increasing our reliance on foreign-controlled supply chains for critical industries as well as everyday goods.\n- India imposes their own uniquely burdensome and/or duplicative testing and certification requirements in sectors such as chemicals, telecom products, and medical devices that make it difficult or costly for American companies to sell their products in India.

Due to these non-reciprocal practices, the U.S. automotive industry loses out on an additional $13.5 billion in annual exports to Japan and access to a larger import market share in Korea—all while the U.S. trade deficit with Korea more than tripled from 2019 to 2024.\n- Monetary tariffs and non-monetary tariffs are two distinct types of trade barriers that governments use to regulate imports and exports. President Trump is countering both through reciprocal tariffs to protect American workers and industries from these unfair practices.\nTHE GOLDEN RULE FOR OUR GOLDEN AGE: Today’s action simply asks other countries to treat us like we treat them. It’s the Golden Rule for Our Golden Age.\n- Access to the American market is a privilege, not a right.\n- The United States will no longer put itself last on matters of international trade in exchange for empty promises.\n- Reciprocal tariffs are a big part of why Americans voted for President Trump—it was a cornerstone of his campaign from the start.\n\nEveryone knew he’d push for them once he got back in office; it’s exactly what he promised, and it’s a key reason he won the election.\n- Everyone knew he’d push for them once he got back in office; it’s exactly what he promised, and it’s a key reason he won the election.\n- These tariffs are central to President Trump’s plan to reverse the economic damage left by President Biden and put America on a path to a new golden age.\n\nThis builds on his broader economic agenda of energy competitiveness, tax cuts, no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security benefits, and deregulation to boost American prosperity.\n- This builds on his broader economic agenda of energy competitiveness, tax cuts, no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security benefits, and deregulation to boost American prosperity.\nTARIFFS WORK: Studies have repeatedly shown that tariffs can be an effective tool for reducing or eliminating threats that impair U.S. national security and achieving economic and strategic objectives.\n- A 2024 study on the effects of President Trump’s tariffs in his first term found that they “strengthened the U.S. economy” and “led to significant reshoring” in industries like manufacturing and steel production.\n- A 2023 report by the U.S. International Trade Commission that analyzed the effects of Section 232 and 301 tariffs on more than $300 billion of U.S. imports found that the tariffs reduced imports from China and effectively stimulated more U.S. production of the tariffed goods, with very minor effects on prices.\n- According to the Economic Policy Institute, the tariffs implemented by President Trump during his first term “clearly show[ed] no correlation with inflation” and only had a temporary effect on overall price levels.\n- An analysis from the Atlantic Council found that “tariffs would create new incentives for US consumers to buy US-made products.”\n- Former Biden Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen affirmed last year that tariffs do not raise prices: “I don’t believe that American consumers will see any meaningful increase in the prices that they face.”\n- A 2024 economic analysis found that a global tariff of 10% would grow the economy by $728 billion, create 2.8 million jobs, and increase real household incomes by 5.7%."

Trump announces tariffs to level the playing field for American workers and businesses.\nDespite the rhetoric from politicians and the media, studies have repeatedly shown tariffs are an effective tool for achieving economic and strategic objectives — just as they did in President Trump’s first term.\n- A 2024 study on the effects of President Trump’s tariffs in his first term found that they “strengthened the U.S. economy” and “led to significant reshoring” in industries like manufacturing and steel production.\n- A 2023 report by the U.S. International Trade Commission — which analyzed the effects of President Trump’s Section 232 and 301 tariffs on more than $300 billion of U.S. imports — found the tariffs reduced imports from China, effectively stimulated more U.S. production of the affected goods, and had very minor effects on downstream prices.\n- According to the Economic Policy Institute, the tariffs implemented by President Trump during his first term “clearly show[ed] no correlation with inflation” and had only a fleeting effect on overall prices.\n\nEconomic Policy Institute: “Following implementation of Sec. 232 measures in 2018—and prior to the global downturn in 2020—U.S. steel output, employment, capital investment, and financial performance all improved. In particular, U.S. steel producers announced plans to invest more than $15.7 billion in new or upgraded steel facilities, creating at least 3,200 direct new jobs, many of which are now poised to come online.”\n- Economic Policy Institute: “Following implementation of Sec. 232 measures in 2018—and prior to the global downturn in 2020—U.S. steel output, employment, capital investment, and financial performance all improved. In particular, U.S. steel producers announced plans to invest more than $15.7 billion in new or upgraded steel facilities, creating at least 3,200 direct new jobs, many of which are now poised to come online.”\n- An analysis by the Atlantic Council found that “tariffs would create new incentives for US consumers to buy US-made products.”\n- Former Biden Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen affirmed last year that tariffs do not raise prices: “I don’t believe that American consumers will see any meaningful increase in the prices that they face.”\n- A 2024 economic analysis found that a global tariff of 10% would grow the economy by $728 billion, create 2.8 million jobs, and increase real household incomes by 5.7%.\n- President Trump’s first term steel tariffs led to thousands of jobs gains in the metal industry, along with wage increases.\n\nThe tariffs were hailed as a “boon” for Minnesota’s iron ore industry, with state officials crediting them for bolstering the local economy.\n\n\n\nSteel and aluminum imports drastically decreased during President Trump’s first term, falling by nearly one-third from 2016 to 2020.\n\n\n\nThe tariffs led to a wave in investment across the United States, with more than $10 billion committed to build new mills.\n- The tariffs were hailed as a “boon” for Minnesota’s iron ore industry, with state officials crediting them for bolstering the local economy.\n- Steel and aluminum imports drastically decreased during President Trump’s first term, falling by nearly one-third from 2016 to 2020.\n- The tariffs led to a wave in investment across the United States, with more than $10 billion committed to build new mills.\n- The Hill: “The Trump tariffs keep working, to the consternation of many economists”\n- S&P Global: “Global Trade At A Crossroads: Trump Tariffs Forge Better Credit Quality For U.S.-Based Steel And Aluminum Producers With A Protectionist Stance”\n- IndustryWeek: “Tariffs Are Keeping US Steel Production Strong”\n\n“With steel imports down, America’s steelmakers have started investing at home. In addition to Nucor and US Steel, companies like Cleveland-Cliffs, Steel Dynamics, CMC, and AK Steel have invested billions of dollars in at least 16 major new projects throughout the nation. The top five US steel companies more than doubled their total annual investments between 2017 to 2019, from $1.5 billion to $4.2 billion.”\n- “With steel imports down, America’s steelmakers have started investing at home.

Those industries actually employ more people than the steel and aluminum sectors, he says, ‘so this is a really big concern, just from an economic perspective.’”\n- “Chad Bown, an economist and trade specialist, says the tariffs will drive up the price of steel and aluminum for the multiple other industries that use the metals.

With enhanced financial literacy, Americans are forging their own economic destinies free from unnecessary government interference.  As President, I will revive the American Dream, turning it from a relic of the past to a promise for the future in our new Golden Age.\nDuring this National Financial Literacy Month, I urge families, communities, schools, and institutions to commit to bolstering their financial knowledge.  There are amazing resources available to you and your family through the Department of the Treasury’s website that will assist you in making sound financial decisions.  Together, we can all protect each American’s right to economic freedom, securing the promise of prosperity for generations to come."

Trump’s mission of making government work for the people again.\nHere’s what you missed:\n- Tom Krause on restoring fiscal responsibility: “We’re changing the culture … There’s $500 billion of fraud every year, there’s hundreds of billions of dollars of improper payments, and we can’t pass an audit … If I was a public company CFO, I would effectively be removed.”\n- Aram Moghaddassi on improving Social Security benefits: “The two improvements that we’re trying to make to Social Security are helping people that legitimately get benefits protect them from fraud that they experience every day on a routine basis, and also make the experience better … At Social Security, one of the first things we learned is that they get phone calls every day of people trying to change direct deposit information … We learned 40% of the phone calls that they get are from fraudsters … Almost half.”\n- Elon Musk on cracking down on fraudulent payments: “There were over $300M of Small Business Administration loans that have been given out to people under the age of 11 … $300 million to over the age of 120 … The youngest recipient of a Small Business Administration loan is a nine-month-old.”\n- Brad Smith on enhancing health care: “There’s 700 different IT systems today at NIH … They can’t speak to each other. They have 27 different CIOs. And so when you think about making great medical discoveries, you have to connect the data.”\n- Joe Gebbia on making government retirement more efficient: “The process takes many months — and we’re going to make it just many days.”\n- Elon Musk on waste, fraud, and abuse: “The sheer amount of waste and fraud in the government, it is astonishing — it’s mind blowing. We routinely encounter wastes of $1 billion or more — casually.”\n- Elon Musk on DOGE’s core mission: “At the end of the day, America is going to be in much better shape. America will be solvent. The critical programs that people depend upon will work and it’s going to be a fantastic future.”"

This is dangerous in agencies with national security responsibilities:\n- Agencies cannot modify policies in collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) until they expire.\n\nThe outgoing Biden Administration renegotiated many agencies’ CBAs to last through President Trump’s second term.\n- The outgoing Biden Administration renegotiated many agencies’ CBAs to last through President Trump’s second term.\n- Agencies cannot make most contractually permissible changes until after finishing “midterm” union bargaining.\n\nFor example, the FLRA ruled that ICE could not modify cybersecurity policies without giving its union an opportunity to negotiate, and then completing midterm bargaining.\n- For example, the FLRA ruled that ICE could not modify cybersecurity policies without giving its union an opportunity to negotiate, and then completing midterm bargaining.\n- Unions used these powers to block the implementation of the VA Accountability Act; the Biden Administration had to offer reinstatement and backpay to over 4,000 unionized employees that the VA had removed for poor performance or misconduct.\nSAFEGUARDING AMERICAN INTERESTS: President Trump is taking action to ensure that agencies vital to national security can execute their missions without delay and protect the American people. The President needs a responsive and accountable civil service to protect our national security.\n- Certain Federal unions have declared war on President Trump’s agenda.The largest Federal union describes itself as “fighting back” against Trump. It is widely filing grievances to block Trump policies.\n\nFor example, VA’s unions have filed 70 national and local grievances over President Trump’s policies since the inauguration—an average of over one a day.\n- The largest Federal union describes itself as “fighting back” against Trump.

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose and Policy.  Over the past decade, Americans have witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation’s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.  This revisionist movement seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.  Under this historical revision, our Nation’s unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed.  Rather than fostering unity and a deeper understanding of our shared past, the widespread effort to rewrite history deepens societal divides and fosters a sense of national shame, disregarding the progress America has made and the ideals that continue to inspire millions around the globe.\nThe prior administration advanced this corrosive ideology.  At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — where our Nation declared that all men are created equal — the prior administration sponsored training by an organization that advocates dismantling “Western foundations” and “interrogating institutional racism” and pressured National Historical Park rangers that their racial identity should dictate how they convey history to visiting Americans because America is purportedly racist.\nOnce widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.  This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.  For example, the Smithsonian American Art Museum today features “The Shape of Power:  Stories of Race and American Sculpture,” an exhibit representing that “[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.”  The exhibit further claims that “sculpture has been a powerful tool in promoting scientific racism” and promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct, stating “Race is a human invention.”\nThe National Museum of African American History and Culture has proclaimed that “hard work,” “individualism,” and “the nuclear family” are aspects of “White culture.”  The forthcoming Smithsonian American Women’s History Museum plans on celebrating the exploits of male athletes participating in women’s sports.  These are just a few examples.\nIt is the policy of my Administration to restore Federal sites dedicated to history, including parks and museums, to solemn and uplifting public monuments that remind Americans of our extraordinary heritage, consistent progress toward becoming a more perfect Union, and unmatched record of advancing liberty, prosperity, and human flourishing.  Museums in our Nation’s capital should be places where individuals go to learn — not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history.\nTo advance this policy, we will restore the Smithsonian Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness –- igniting the imagination of young minds, honoring the richness of American history and innovation, and instilling pride in the hearts of all Americans.\nSec. 2.  Saving Our Smithsonian.  (a)  The Vice President, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Staff Secretary, Lindsey Halligan, Esq., shall work to effectuate the policies of this order through his role on the Smithsonian Board of Regents with respect to the Smithsonian Institution and its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo, including by seeking to remove improper ideology from such properties, and shall recommend to the President any additional actions necessary to fully effectuate such policies.\n(b)  The Vice President and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall work with the Congress to ensure that future appropriations to the Smithsonian Institution:\n(i)   prohibit expenditure on exhibits or programs that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with Federal law and policy; and\n(ii)  celebrate the achievements of women in the American Women’s History Museum and do not recognize men as women in any respect in the Museum.\n(c)  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Interior shall take any other measures within their authority to promote the policy of this order.\n(d)  As appropriate, the Vice President shall, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Staff Secretary, Lindsey Halligan, Esq., work with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate Majority Leader, to seek the appointment of citizen members to the Smithsonian Board of Regents committed to advancing the policy of this order.\nSec. 3.  Restoring Independence Hall.  The Secretary of the Interior shall provide sufficient funding, as available, to improve the infrastructure of Independence National Historical Park, which shall be complete by July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\nSec. 4.  Restoring Truth in American History.\n(a)  The Secretary of the Interior shall:\n(i)    determine whether, since January 1, 2020, public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior’s jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology;\n(ii)   take action to reinstate the pre-existing monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties, as appropriate and consistent with 43 U.S.C. 1451 et seq., 54 U.S.C. 100101 et seq.,and other applicable law; and\n(iii)  take action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to ensure that all public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior’s jurisdiction do not contain descriptions, depictions, or other content that inappropriately disparage Americans past or living (including persons living in colonial times), and instead focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people or, with respect to natural features, the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape.\nSec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:Section 1.  Background.  My Administration is committed to addressing the significant risks associated with law firms, particularly so-called “Big Law” firms, that engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests.  Many firms take actions that threaten public safety and national security, limit constitutional freedoms, degrade the quality of American elections, or undermine bedrock American principles.  Moreover, law firms regularly conduct this harmful activity through their powerful pro bono practices, earmarking hundreds of millions of their clients’ dollars for destructive causes, that often directly or indirectly harm their own clients.  Lawyers and law firms that engage in such egregious conduct should not have access to our Nation’s secrets, nor should such conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts.Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP (WilmerHale) is yet another law firm that has abandoned the profession’s highest ideals and abused its pro bono practice to engage in activities that undermine justice and the interests of the United States.  For example, WilmerHale engages in obvious partisan representations to achieve political ends, supports efforts to discriminate on the basis of race, backs the obstruction of efforts to prevent illegal aliens from committing horrific crimes and trafficking deadly drugs within our borders, and furthers the degradation of the quality of American elections, including by supporting efforts designed to enable noncitizens to vote.  Moreover, WilmerHale itself discriminates against its employees based on race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws, including through the use of race-based “targets.”WilmerHale is also bent on employing lawyers who weaponize the prosecutorial power to upend the democratic process and distort justice.  For example, WilmerHale rewarded Robert Mueller and his colleagues — Aaron Zebley, Mueller’s “top aide” and “closest associate,” and James Quarles — by welcoming them to the firm after they wielded the power of the Federal Government to lead one of the most partisan investigations in American history.  Mueller’s investigation epitomizes the weaponization of government, yet WilmerHale claimed he “embodies the highest value of our firm and profession.”  Mueller’s “investigation” upended the lives of public servants in my Administration who were summoned before “prosecutors” with the effect of interfering in their ability to fulfill the mandates of my first term agenda.  This weaponization of the justice system must not be rewarded, let alone condoned.Sec. 2.  Security Clearance Review.  (a)  The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at WilmerHale, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.(b)  The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of WilmerHale.  The heads of agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision.Sec. 3.  Contracting.  (a)  To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with WilmerHale and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract.(b)  The heads of agencies shall review all contracts with WilmerHale or with entities that disclose doing business with WilmerHale under subsection (a) of this section.  To the extent permitted by law, the heads of agencies shall:(i)   take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, for which WilmerHale has been hired to perform any service; and(ii)  otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with WilmerHale or with entities that do business with WilmerHale effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order.Sec. 4.  Racial Discrimination.  Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the action authorized by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP).  Sec. 5.  Personnel.  (a)  The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of WilmerHale when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States.  In addition, the heads of agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with WilmerHale employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States.(b)  Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of WilmerHale, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States. Sec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

Thanks to a coordinated effort by federal law enforcement and state and local law enforcement in Virginia, this gang leader is no longer terrorizing our streets.\nHere’s what you need to know:\n- Attorney General Pam Bondi: “America is safer today because one of the top domestic terrorists in MS-13, he is off the streets. This has been an ongoing directive of President Trump. His directive to me when I became Attorney General of the United States was very simple: keep America safe.”\n- Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin: “It’s this effort that has been enabled by the Trump Administration. President Trump said, ‘Get the bad guys.’ I’ve been working on this — literally — for the first three years of our administration with little to no help from the senior leadership in the federal government in the Biden Administration. On Day One [of President Trump’s second term], we went to work signing a 287(g) memorandum.”\n- FBI Director Kash Patel: “This is what happens when you let good cops be cops and we’re going to continue to let good cops be cops across this country. President Trump gave us the executive decision to go after and safeguard our communities … We are returning our communities to safety.”\n- Attorney General Bondi: “From the second Donald Trump took office, he said he is going to make America safe.

    "content": "BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAA PROCLAMATION\n1.  On February 17, 2019, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effects of imports of passenger vehicles (sedans, sport utility vehicles, crossover utility vehicles, minivans, and cargo vans) and light trucks (collectively, automobiles) and certain automobile parts (engines and engine parts, transmissions and powertrain parts, and electrical components) (collectively, automobile parts) on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (section 232).  Based on the facts considered in that investigation, the Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that automobiles and certain automobile parts are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.\n2.  In Proclamation 9888 of May 17, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), I concurred with the Secretary’s finding in the February 17, 2019, report that automobiles and certain automobile parts are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.  I also directed the United States Trade Representative (Trade Representative), in consultation with other executive branch officials, to pursue negotiation of agreements to address the threatened impairment of the national security of the United States with respect to imported automobiles and certain automobile parts from the European Union, Japan, and any other country the Trade Representative deems appropriate.\n3.  The Trade Representative’s negotiations did not lead to any agreements of the type contemplated by section 232.\n4.  In Proclamation 9888, I also directed the Secretary to monitor imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts and inform me of any circumstances that, in the Secretary’s opinion, might indicate the need for further action under section 232 with respect to such imports.\n5. The Secretary has informed me that, since the February 17, 2019, report, the national security concerns remain and have escalated.  The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical vulnerabilities and choke points in global supply chains, undermining our ability to maintain a resilient domestic industrial base.  In recent years, American-owned automotive manufacturers have experienced numerous supply chain challenges, including material and parts input shortages, labor shortages and strikes, and electrical-component shortages.  Meanwhile, foreign automotive industries, propelled by unfair subsidies and aggressive industrial policies, have grown substantially.  Today, only about half of the vehicles sold in the United States are manufactured domestically, a decline that jeopardizes our domestic industrial base and national security, and the United States’ share of worldwide automobile production has remained stagnant since the February 17, 2019, report.  The number of employees in the domestic automotive industry has also not improved since the February 17, 2019, report.\n6.  I am also advised that agreements entered into before the issuance of Proclamation 9888, such as the revisions to the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), have not yielded sufficient positive outcomes.  The threat to national security posed by imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts remains and has increased.  Investments resulting from other efforts, such as legislation, have also not yielded sufficient positive outcomes to eliminate the threat to national security from such imports.\n7.  After considering the current information newly provided by the Secretary, among other things, I find that imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts continue to threaten to impair the national security of the United States and deem it necessary and appropriate to impose tariffs, as defined below, to adjust imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts so that such imports will not threaten to impair national security.\n8.  To ensure that the imposition of tariffs on automobiles and certain automobile parts in this proclamation are not circumvented and that the purpose of this action to eliminate the threat to the national security of the United States by imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts is not undermined, I also deem it necessary and appropriate to establish processes to identify and impose tariffs on additional automobile parts, as further described below.\n9.  Section 232 provides that, in this situation, the President shall take such other actions as the President deems necessary to adjust the imports of the relevant article so that such imports will not threaten to impair national security.\n10.  Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code; section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended; and section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:(1)  Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, all imports of articles specified in Annex I to this proclamation or in any subsequent annex to this proclamation, as set out in a subsequent notice in the Federal Register, shall be subject to a 25 percent tariff with respect to goods entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 3, 2025, for automobiles, and on the date specified in the Federal Register for automobile parts, but no later than May 3, 2025, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.  The above ad valorem tariff is in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported automobiles and certain automobile parts articles.(2)  For automobiles that qualify for preferential tariff treatment under the USMCA, importers of such automobiles may submit documentation to the Secretary identifying the amount of U.S. content in each model imported into the United States.  “U.S. content” refers to the value of the automobile attributable to parts wholly obtained, produced entirely, or substantially transformed in the United States.  Thereafter, the Secretary may approve imports of such automobiles to be eligible to apply the ad valorem tariff of 25 percent in clause (1) of this proclamation exclusively to the value of the non-U.S. content of the automobile.  The non-U.S. content of the automobile shall be calculated by subtracting the value of the U.S. content in an automobile from the total value of the automobile.(3)  If U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) determines that the declared value of non-U.S. content of an automobile, as described in clause (2) of this proclamation, is inaccurate due to an overstatement of U.S. content, the 25 percent tariff shall apply to the full value of the automobile, regardless of the actual U.S. content of the automobile.  In addition, the 25 percent tariff shall be applied retroactively (from April 3, 2025, to the date of the inaccurate overstatement) and prospectively (from the date of the inaccurate overstatement to the date the importer corrects the overstatement, as verified by CBP) to the full value of all automobiles of the same model imported by the same importer.  This clause does not apply to or otherwise affect any other applicable fees or penalties.(4)  The ad valorem tariff of 25 percent described in clause (1) of this proclamation shall not apply to automobile parts that qualify for preferential treatment under the USMCA until such time that the Secretary, in consultation with CBP, establishes a process to apply the tariff exclusively to the value of the non-U.S. content of such automobile parts and publishes notice in the Federal Register.(5)  For avoidance of doubt, clause (4) of this proclamation does not apply to automobile knock-down kits or parts compilations.  Clause (4) of this proclamation applies only to individual automobile parts as defined by Annex I to this proclamation that otherwise meet the requirements of clause (4) of this proclamation.(6)  The Secretary, in consultation with the United States International Trade Commission and CBP, shall determine the modifications necessary to the HTSUS to effectuate this proclamation and shall make such modifications to the HTSUS through notice in the Federal Register.  (7)  Within 90 days of the date of this proclamation, the Secretary shall establish a process for including additional automobile parts articles within the scope of the tariffs described in clause (1) of this proclamation. In addition to inclusions made by the Secretary, this process shall provide for including additional automobile parts articles at the request of a domestic producer of an automobile or automobile parts article, or an industry association representing one or more such producers, where the request establishes that imports of additional automobile parts articles have increased in a manner that threatens to impair the national security or otherwise undermines the objectives set forth in any proclamation issued on the basis of the Secretary’s February 17, 2019, report or any additional information submitted to the President under clause (3) of Proclamation 9888 or clause (9) of this proclamation. When the Secretary receives such a request from a domestic producer or industry association, the Secretary, after consultation with the United States International Trade Commission and CBP, shall issue a determination regarding whether to include the articles within 60 days of receiving the request.  Any additional automobile parts articles that the Secretary has determined to be included within the scope of the tariffs described in clause (1) of this proclamation shall be so included on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time the day after a notice in the Federal Register describing the determination of the Secretary.  The notice in the Federal Register shall be made as soon as practicable but no later than 14 days after the Secretary’s determination.(8) Any automobile or automobile part, except those eligible for admission under “domestic status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, that is subject to the duty imposed by this proclamation and that is admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after the effective date of this proclamation, in accordance with clause (1) of this proclamation, must be admitted as “privileged foreign status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, and will be subject upon entry for consumption to any ad valorem rates of duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading.(9)  The Secretary shall continue to monitor imports of automobiles and automobile parts.  The Secretary also shall, from time to time, in consultation with any senior executive branch officials the Secretary deems appropriate, review the status of such imports with respect to national security.  The Secretary shall inform the President of any circumstances that, in the Secretary’s opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President under section 232.  The Secretary shall also inform the President of any circumstance that, in the Secretary’s opinion, might indicate that the increase in duty rate provided for in this proclamation is no longer necessary.(10)  No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed pursuant to this proclamation.(11)  The Secretary may issue regulations and guidance consistent with this proclamation, including to address operational necessity.(12)  CBP may take any necessary or appropriate measures to administer the tariffs imposed by this proclamation.(13)  Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth."

    "content": "COUNTERING TRADE PRACTICES THAT THREATEN TO IMPAIR U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a proclamation invoking Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose a 25% tariff on imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts, addressing a critical threat to U.S. national security.\n- President Trump is taking action to protect America’s automobile industry, which is vital to national security and has been undermined by excessive imports threatening America’s domestic industrial base and supply chains.\n- The 25% tariff will be applied to imported passenger vehicles (sedans, SUVs, crossovers, minivans, cargo vans) and light trucks, as well as key automobile parts (engines, transmissions, powertrain parts, and electrical components), with processes to expand tariffs on additional parts if necessary.\n- Importers of automobiles under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will be given the opportunity to certify their U.S. content and systems will be implemented such that the 25% tariff will only apply to the value of their non-U.S. content.\n\nUSMCA-compliant automobile parts will remain tariff-free until the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), establishes a process to apply tariffs to their non-U.S. content.\n- USMCA-compliant automobile parts will remain tariff-free until the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), establishes a process to apply tariffs to their non-U.S. content.\n- The President is exercising his authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to adjust imports to protect our national security.\n\nThis statute provides the President with authority to adjust imports being brought into the United States in quantities or under circumstances that threaten to impair national security.\n- This statute provides the President with authority to adjust imports being brought into the United States in quantities or under circumstances that threaten to impair national security.\nMAINTAINING A RESILIENT DOMESTIC INDUSTRIAL BASE: President Trump is taking action to end unfair trade practices that jeopardize U.S. national security.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical vulnerabilities and choke points in global supply chains, undermining our ability to maintain a resilient domestic industrial base.\n- Legislation, pre-existing trade agreements like the USMCA, revisions to the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, and subsequent negotiations have not sufficiently mitigated the threat to national security posed by imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts.\n- These new tariffs aim to ensure the U.S. can sustain its domestic industrial base and meet national security needs.\nSTRENGTHENING AMERICA’S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY: President Trump’s decision to implement tariffs on imports of automobiles and automobile parts will protect and strengthen the U.S. automotive sector.\n- Foreign automobile industries, bolstered by unfair subsidies and aggressive industrial policies, have expanded, while U.S. production has stagnated.\n- In 1985, American-owned facilities in the United States manufactured 11.0 million automobiles, representing 97% of overall domestic (American- and foreign-owned) production of automobiles.\n- In 2024, Americans bought approximately 16 million cars, SUVs, and light trucks, and 50% of these vehicles were imports (8 million).\n\nOf the other 8 million vehicles assembled in America and not imported, the average domestic content is conservatively estimated at only 50% and is likely closer to 40%.\n\n\n\nTherefore, of the 16 million cars bought by Americans, only 25% of the vehicle content can be categorized as Made in America.\n- Of the other 8 million vehicles assembled in America and not imported, the average domestic content is conservatively estimated at only 50% and is likely closer to 40%.\n- Therefore, of the 16 million cars bought by Americans, only 25% of the vehicle content can be categorized as Made in America.\n- The United States trade deficit in automobile parts reached $93.5 billion in 2024.\n- Currently, the U.S. automobile and automobile parts industry (American-owned and foreign-owned firms) employs approximately one million U.S. workers.\n- Employment in automotive parts manufacturing totaled approximately 553,300 jobs in 2024, a decline of 286,000 jobs or 34% since 2000.\n- In 2023, Research and Development (R&D) by American-owned automobile manufacturers amounted to only 16% of global R&D spending. R&D by American-owned firms lagged behind the EU, which controlled 53% of global R&D.\nTARIFFS WORK: Studies have repeatedly shown that tariffs can be an effective tool for reducing or eliminating threats to impair U.S. national security and achieving economic and strategic objectives.\n- A 2024 study on the effects of President Trump’s tariffs in his first term found that they “strengthened the U.S. economy” and “led to significant reshoring” in industries like manufacturing and steel production.\n- A 2023 report by the U.S. International Trade Commission that analyzed the effects of Section 232 and 301 tariffs on more than $300 billion of U.S. imports found that the tariffs reduced imports from China and effectively stimulated more U.S. production of the tariffed goods, with very minor effects on prices.\n- According to the Economic Policy Institute, the tariffs implemented by President Trump during his first term “clearly show[ed] no correlation with inflation” and only had a temporary effect on overall price levels.\n- An analysis from the Atlantic Council found that “tariffs would create new incentives for US consumers to buy US-made products.”\n- Former Biden Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen affirmed last year that tariffs do not raise prices: “I don’t believe that American consumers will see any meaningful increase in the prices that they face.”\n- A 2024 economic analysis found that a global tariff of 10% would grow the economy by $728 billion, create 2.8 million jobs, and increase real household incomes by 5.7%."

    "slug": "the-staggering-cost-of-the-illicit-opioid-epidemic-in-the-united-states",
    "content": "Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 times more potent than heroin, is cheaper to produce and easier to smuggle across borders, fueling the illicit opioid epidemic in the United States with devastating consequences. In 2023 alone, illicit opioids, primarily fentanyl, cost Americans an estimated $2.7 trillion (in December 2024 dollars), equivalent to 9.7 percent of GDP. Of this total cost, 41 percent ($1.1 trillion) is attributed to deaths, 49 percent ($1.34 trillion) to lost quality of life, and 10 percent ($277 billion) to other costs such as healthcare, reduced labor productivity, and crime-related expenses. Alarmingly, 93 percent of opioid deaths are caused by powerful synthetic opioids like fentanyl, which typically originate in China and are trafficked through Mexico.\nThis number dwarfs even pessimistic estimates of the effects of tariffs, like that of Goldman Sachs, who estimated losses of 0.4 percent of GDP.\nThe CEA previously studied this issue and came up with a smaller number. The primary reasons are because it did not include the cost of reduced quality of life and because the number of deaths in 2015 was 33,000.\nOur cost estimates are based on a 2017 CDC study which we have updated to account for inflation and the sharp rise in opioid deaths and opioid use disorder (OUD) since then. According to the DEA, an estimated 74,702 Americans died in 2023, a staggering 1.6 times more than in 2017. Additionally, the number of Americans living with OUD increased by 2.7 times to 5.7 million during the same period. We have adjusted the calculations to reflect current prices as well as the alarming rise in opioid addiction and deaths. We scale up the loss of life estimates based on the increase in fatalities, while we scale up the other estimates to reflect the increase in the prevalence of those living with OUD. The breakdown of the cost estimates, all expressed in December 2024 dollars, is as follows:\n- Loss of life: $1.11 trillion. This estimate is calculated by multiplying the number of lives lost (74,702) by the value of statistical life in the United States and then adding productivity and healthcare costs that arise due to opioid fatalities. We inflation adjusted the $10.1 million value of a statistical life number provided by NIH (2017) to 2025 dollars ($13.0 million per life). The value of a loss of life is based on market and survey based evidence on what amount of money people are willing to forgo to change the probability of death. For example, many estimates rely on the value of life implied by the increase in wages required for people to take jobs with higher mortality risk.\n- Loss of quality of life: $1.34 trillion. This estimate is the product of three factors. First is a survey-based measure for the loss in quality of life for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) compared to those in full health. The measure shows that life with OUD has about 60 percent (0.626) of the quality of life of those in full health. Second is a measure of how much Americans value a year of life in full health. Adjusted for inflation, this value is estimated at $624,410 per person per year. Together these values imply that the lost quality of life costs $234,478 per year for each person living with OUD. We then multiply this value by the prevalence of OUD, estimated to be 5.7 million in 2023.\n- Healthcare system: $107 billion. This estimate represents the additional annual costs incurred by the healthcare system for treating individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) relative to the average annual costs of treating those without OUD. This amounts to $19,000 additional dollars per year per person with OUD. These costs were primarily borne by private insurers, Medicaid, and hospitals providing uncompensated care. Ultimately, these costs are passed on to all Americans through higher insurance premiums, taxes, and healthcare expenses.\n- Loss of labor force productivity: $107 billion. This estimate is calculated by multiplying the number of productive work hours lost due to opioid-related deaths, OUD, and incarceration by the average hourly total compensation (wages and benefits) for American workers.\n- Crime-related: $63 billion. This figure represents the sum of costs incurred for additional police protection, judicial activities, correctional facilities, and property loss resulting from opioid-related crime.\nThe enormous economic cost of the illicit opioid epidemic to Americans, estimated at $2.7 trillion in 2023 alone, underscores the urgent need to control the flow of lethal drugs pouring in from foreign countries. The human suffering and financial burden inflicted by this epidemic are unsustainable."

and\n(ii)  otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with Jenner or with entities that do business with Jenner effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order.\nSec. 4.  Racial Discrimination.  Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the action authorized by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP).\nSec. 5.  Personnel.  (a)  The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Jenner when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States.  In addition, the heads of agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Jenner employees, including but not limited to Andrew Weissmann, to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States.\n(b)  Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of Jenner, including but not limited to Andrew Weissmann, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States.\nSec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1.  Purpose and Policy.  Despite pioneering self-government, the United States now fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections employed by modern, developed nations, as well as those still developing.  India and Brazil, for example, are tying voter identification to a biometric database, while the United States largely relies on self-attestation for citizenship.  In tabulating votes, Germany and Canada require use of paper ballots, counted in public by local officials, which substantially reduces the number of disputes as compared to the American patchwork of voting methods that can lead to basic chain-of-custody problems.  Further, while countries like Denmark and Sweden sensibly limit mail-in voting to those unable to vote in person and do not count late-arriving votes regardless of the date of postmark, many American elections now feature mass voting by mail, with many officials accepting ballots without postmarks or those received well after Election Day. Free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional Republic.  The right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election.Under the Constitution, State governments must safeguard American elections in compliance with Federal laws that protect Americans’ voting rights and guard against dilution by illegal voting, discrimination, fraud, and other forms of malfeasance and error.  Yet the United States has not adequately enforced Federal election requirements that, for example, prohibit States from counting ballots received after Election Day or prohibit non-citizens from registering to vote.Federal law establishes a uniform Election Day across the Nation for Federal elections, 2 U.S.C. 7 and 3 U.S.C. 1.  It is the policy of my Administration to enforce those statutes and require that votes be cast and received by the election date established in law.  As the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recently held in Republican National Committee v. Wetzel (2024), those statutes set “the day by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials.”  Yet numerous States fail to comply with those laws by counting ballots received after Election Day.  This is like allowing persons who arrive 3 days after Election Day, perhaps after a winner has been declared, to vote in person at a former voting precinct, which would be absurd.  Several Federal laws, including 18 U.S.C. 1015 and 611, prohibit foreign nationals from registering to vote or voting in Federal elections.  Yet States fail adequately to vet voters’ citizenship, and, in recent years, the Department of Justice has failed to prioritize and devote sufficient resources for enforcement of these provisions.  Even worse, the prior administration actively prevented States from removing aliens from their voter lists.  Additionally, Federal laws, such as the National Voter Registration Act (Public Law 103-31) and the Help America Vote Act (Public Law 107-252), require States to maintain an accurate and current Statewide list of every legally registered voter in the State.  And the Department of Homeland Security is required to share database information with States upon request so they can fulfill this duty.  See 8 U.S.C. 1373(c).  Maintaining accurate voter registration lists is a fundamental requirement in protecting voters from having their ballots voided or diluted by fraudulent votes. Federal law, 52 U.S.C. 30121, prohibits foreign nationals from participating in Federal, State, or local elections by making any contributions or expenditures.  But foreign nationals and non-governmental organizations have taken advantage of loopholes in the law’s interpretation, spending millions of dollars through conduit contributions and ballot-initiative-related expenditures.  This type of foreign interference in our election process undermines the franchise and the right of American citizens to govern their Republic.  Above all, elections must be honest and worthy of the public trust.  That requires voting methods that produce a voter-verifiable paper record allowing voters to efficiently check their votes to protect against fraud or mistake.  Election-integrity standards must be modified accordingly.It is the policy of my Administration to enforce Federal law and to protect the integrity of our election process.Sec. 2.  Enforcing the Citizenship Requirement for Federal Elections.  To enforce the Federal prohibition on foreign nationals voting in Federal elections:\n(a)(i) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Election Assistance Commission shall take appropriate action to require, in its national mail voter registration form issued under 52 U.S.C. 20508:\n(A)  documentary proof of United States citizenship, consistent with 52 U.S.C. 20508(b)(3); and\n(B)  a State or local official to record on the form the type of document that the applicant presented as documentary proof of United States citizenship, including the date of the document’s issuance, the date of the document’s expiration (if any), the office that issued the document, and any unique identification number associated with the document as required by the criteria in 52 U.S.C. 21083(a)(5)(A), while taking appropriate measures to ensure information security.\n(ii)  For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, “documentary proof of United States citizenship” shall include a copy of:\n(A)  a United States passport;\n(B)  an identification document compliant with the requirements of the REAL ID Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-13, Div. B) that indicates the applicant is a citizen of the United States;\n(C)  an official military identification card that indicates the applicant is a citizen of the United States; or\n(D)  a valid Federal or State government-issued photo identification if such identification indicates that the applicant is a United States citizen or if such identification is otherwise accompanied by proof of United States citizenship.\n(b)  To identify unqualified voters registered in the States:\n(i)    the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law, ensure that State and local officials have, without the requirement of the payment of a fee, access to appropriate systems for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals registering to vote or who are already registered;\n(ii)   the Secretary of State shall take all lawful and appropriate action to make available information from relevant databases to State and local election officials engaged in verifying the citizenship of individuals registering to vote or who are already registered; and\n(iii)  the Department of Homeland Security, in coordination with the DOGE Administrator, shall review each State’s publicly available voter registration list and available records concerning voter list maintenance activities as required by 52 U.S.C. 20507, alongside Federal immigration databases and State records requested, including through subpoena where necessary and authorized by law, for consistency with Federal requirements.\n(c)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law, provide to the Attorney General complete information on all foreign nationals who have indicated on any immigration form that they have registered or voted in a Federal, State, or local election, and shall also take all appropriate action to submit to relevant State or local election officials such information.\n(d)  The head of each Federal voter registration executive department or agency (agency) under the National Voter Registration Act, 52 U.S.C. 20506(a), shall assess citizenship prior to providing a Federal voter registration form to enrollees of public assistance programs.\n(e)  The Attorney General shall prioritize enforcement of 18 U.S.C. 611 and 1015(f) and similar laws that restrict non-citizens from registering to vote or voting, including through use of:\n(i)    databases or information maintained by the Department of Homeland Security;\n(ii)   State-issued identification records and driver license databases; and\n(iii)  similar records relating to citizenship.\n(f)  The Attorney General shall, consistent with applicable laws, coordinate with State attorneys general to assist with State-level review and prosecution of aliens unlawfully registered to vote or casting votes.Sec. 3.  Providing Other Assistance to States Verifying Eligibility.  To assist States in determining whether individuals are eligible to register and vote:\n(a)  The Commissioner of Social Security shall take all appropriate action to make available the Social Security Number Verification Service, the Death Master File, and any other Federal databases containing relevant information to all State and local election officials engaged in verifying the eligibility of individuals registering to vote or who are already registered.  In determining and taking such action, the Commissioner of Social Security shall ensure compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations.\n(b)  The Attorney General shall ensure compliance with the requirements of 52 U.S.C. 20507(g).\n(c)  The Attorney General shall take appropriate action with respect to States that fail to comply with the list maintenance requirements of the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America     Vote Act contained in 52 U.S.C. 20507 and 52 U.S.C. 21083.\n(d)  The Secretary of Defense shall update the Federal Post Card Application, pursuant to the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, 52 U.S.C. 20301, to require:\n(i)   documentary proof of United States citizenship, as defined by section 2(a)(ii) of this order; and\n(ii)  proof of eligibility to vote in elections in the State in which the voter is attempting to vote.\nSec. 4.  Improving the Election Assistance Commission.  (a)  The Election Assistance Commission shall, pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 21003(b)(3)and 21142(c) and consistent with applicable law, take all appropriate action to cease providing Federal funds to States that do not comply with the Federal laws set forth in 52 U.S.C. 21145, including the requirement in 52 U.S.C. 20505(a)(1) that States accept and use the national mail voter registration form issued pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 20508(a)(1), including any requirement for documentary proof of United States citizenship adopted pursuant to section 2(a)(ii) of this order.\n(b)(i) The Election Assistance Commission shall initiate appropriate action to amend the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0 and issue other appropriate guidance establishing standards for voting systems to protect election integrity.  The amended guidelines and other guidance shall provide that voting systems should not use a ballot in which a vote is contained within a barcode or quick-response code in the vote counting process except where necessary to accommodate individuals with disabilities and should provide a voter-verifiable paper record to prevent fraud or mistake.\n(ii)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Election Assistance Commission shall take appropriate action to review and, if appropriate, re-certify voting systems under the new standards established under subsection (b)(i) of this section, and to rescind all previous certifications of voting equipment based on prior standards.\n(c)  Following an audit of Help America Vote Act fund expenditures conducted pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 21142, the Election Assistance Commission shall report any discrepancies or issues with an audited State’s certifications of compliance with Federal law to the Department of Justice for appropriate enforcement action.\n(d) The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, consistent with applicable law, shall in considering the provision of funding for State or local election offices or administrators through the Homeland Security Grant Programs, 6 U.S.C. 603 et seq., heavily prioritize compliance with the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0 developed by the Election Assistance Commission and completion of testing through the Voting System Test Labs accreditation process.Sec. 5.  Prosecuting Election Crimes.  To protect the franchise of American citizens and their right to participate in fair and honest elections:\n(a)  The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to enter into information-sharing agreements, to the maximum extent possible, with the chief State election official or multi-member agency of each State.  These agreements shall aim to provide the Department of Justice with detailed information on all suspected violations of State and Federal election laws discovered by State officials, including information on individuals who:\n(i)    registered or voted despite being ineligible or who registered multiple times;\n(ii)   committed election fraud;\n(iii)  provided false information on voter registration or other election forms;\n(iv)   intimidated or threatened voters or election officials; or\n(v)    otherwise engaged in unlawful conduct to interfere in the election process.\n(b)  To the extent that any States are unwilling to enter into such an information sharing agreement or refuse to cooperate in investigations and prosecutions of election crimes, the Attorney General shall:\n(i)   prioritize enforcement of Federal election integrity laws in such States to ensure election integrity given the State’s demonstrated unwillingness to enter into an information-sharing agreement or to cooperate in investigations and prosecutions; and\n(ii)  review for potential withholding of grants and other funds that the Department awards and distributes, in the Department’s discretion, to State and local governments for law enforcement and other purposes, as consistent with applicable law.\n(c)  The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to align the Department of Justice’s litigation positions with the purpose and policy of this order.Sec. 6.  Improving Security of Voting Systems.  To improve the security of all voting equipment and systems used to cast ballots, tabulate votes, and report results:\n(a)  The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate actions to the extent permitted by 42 U.S.C. 5195c and all other applicable law, so long as the Department of Homeland Security maintains the designation of election infrastructure as critical infrastructure, as defined by 42 U.S.C. 5195c(e), to prevent all non-citizens from being involved in the administration of any Federal election, including by accessing election equipment, ballots, or any other relevant materials used in the conduct of any Federal election.\n(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in coordination with the Election Assistance Commission and to the maximum extent possible, review and report on the security of all electronic systems used in the voter registration and voting process.  The Secretary of Homeland Security, as the head of the designated Sector Risk Management Agency under 6 U.S.C. 652a, in coordination with the Election Assistance Commission, shall assess the security of all such systems to the extent they are connected to, or integrated into, the Internet and report on the risk of such systems being compromised through malicious software and unauthorized intrusions into the system.  Sec. 7.  Compliance with Federal Law Setting the National Election Day.  To achieve full compliance with the Federal laws that set the uniform day for appointing Presidential electors and electing members of Congress:\n(a)  The Attorney General shall take all necessary action to enforce 2 U.S.C. 7 and 3 U.S.C. 1 against States that violate these provisions by including absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day in the final tabulation of votes for the appointment of Presidential electors and the election of members of the United States Senate and House of Representatives.\n(b)  Consistent with 52 U.S.C. 21001(b) and other applicable law, the Election Assistance Commission shall condition any available funding to a State on that State’s compliance with the requirement in 52 U.S.C. 21081(a)(6) that each State adopt uniform and nondiscriminatory standards within that State that define what constitutes a vote and what will be counted as a vote, including that, as prescribed in 2 U.S.C. 7 and 3 U.S.C. 1, there be a uniform and nondiscriminatory ballot receipt deadline of Election Day for all methods of voting, excluding ballots cast in accordance with 52 U.S.C. 20301 et seq., after which no additional votes may be cast.  Sec. 8.  Preventing Foreign Interference and Unlawful Use of Federal Funds.  The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall prioritize enforcement of 52 U.S.C. 30121 and other appropriate laws to prevent foreign nationals from contributing or donating in United States elections.  The Attorney General shall likewise prioritize enforcement of 31 U.S.C. 1352, which prohibits lobbying by organizations or entities that have received any Federal funds.   Sec. 9.  Federal Actions to Address Executive Order 14019.  The heads of all agencies, and the Election Assistance Commission, shall cease all agency actions implementing Executive Order 14019 of March 7, 2021 (Promoting Access to Voting), which was revoked by Executive Order 14148 of on January 20, 2025 (Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions), and, within 90 days of the date of this order, submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, a report describing compliance with this order.Sec. 10.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any agency, person, or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other agencies, persons, or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.Sec. 11.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof;

Purpose.  Promoting financial integrity and operational efficiency are critical responsibilities of the Federal Government.  The Federal Government processes trillions of dollars annually in disbursements to individuals, businesses, and organizations, and in receipts from taxes, fees, and other payments to finance daily and long-term Government operations.  These transactions flow into and out of the United States General Fund (General Fund), which might be thought of as America’s bank account.  In Fiscal Year 2024, $33.9 trillion flowed into the General Fund and $33.6 trillion flowed out of the account, including $5.87 trillion (less net interest) in benefits, grants, loans, vendor payments, and other disbursements.\nThe Department of the Treasury is the largest financial payment manager of the Federal Government and is responsible for safeguarding the General Fund, but lacks sufficient controls to track transactions flowing through the General Fund to determine if they were proper.  To enforce sufficient controls and ensure accountability to American taxpayers, the Department of the Treasury requires financial information from executive departments and agencies (agencies) beyond what they currently provide.\nFinancial fraud threatens the integrity of Federal programs and undermines trust in Government.  Agencies’ past underinvestment in technology and longstanding challenges with access to accurate data has prevented them from more fully safeguarding taxpayer dollars against fraud and improper payments.  The Government Accountability Office estimates that the Federal Government loses between $233 and $521 billion annually to fraud.\nIn addition to being an efficient steward of taxpayer funds, the Federal Government, on behalf of the American public, must seek to ensure that financial information is accurate and that there is transparency with respect to how taxpayer dollars are being used.  Today, Federal funds are disbursed both by the Department of the Treasury and various Federal Government entities that are authorized to issue their own disbursements known as Non-Treasury Disbursing Offices (NTDOs).  In Fiscal Year 2024, NTDOs were estimated to be responsible for 181 million payments totaling over $1.5 trillion (approximately 22 percent of all Federal Government dollars disbursed). This fragmentation of disbursing authority, together with the proliferation of non-standard financial management systems across the Federal Government, leads to expensive, disjointed, and duplicative financial reporting, lack of financial traceability, complicated financial management, opacity, increased operational risks, and decreased ability of the Department of the Treasury to provide centralized oversight.\nThis order promotes financial integrity by enabling the Department of the Treasury to more easily conduct improper payment and fraud prevention screening prior to disbursing funds on behalf of agencies.  This order increases transparency and accountability by requiring agencies to provide the Department of the Treasury with the information needed to track transactions through the General Fund in greater detail.  This order also promotes operational efficiency by returning disbursing functions to the Department of the Treasury when possible and consolidating and standardizing core Federal financial systems.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to defend against financial fraud and improper payments, increase transparency and accountability around the Federal Government’s operations and financial condition, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the security of Federal payments.\nSec. 3.  Treasury Verification of Agency Payments Information.  (a)  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director), shall update guidance and enhance systems to ensure that all payments made by the Department of the Treasury on behalf of agencies pursuant to the Secretary of the Treasury’s disbursing authority, including 31 U.S.C. 3321, are subject to pre-certification verification processes established by the Secretary of the Treasury and conducted by agencies and the Department of the Treasury for the purposes of defending against financial fraud and improper payments, to the greatest extent permitted by law.  Such guidance shall set forth guidelines for compliance with the Do Not Pay Working System as described in 31 U.S.C. 3351 et seq., and such other payment, account, and payee validation programs and services that the Secretary of the Treasury and the OMB Director determine to be beneficial for reducing financial fraud and improper payments.\n(b)  In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3354, the heads of all agencies shall cooperate with the Secretary of the Treasury to fulfill their obligations to determine payment or award eligibility through pre-certification and pre-award procedures, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, including pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and section 4 of this order to prevent fraud and improper payments.\n(c)  The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to minimize administrative barriers to accessing and using data to prevent fraud and improper payments by exercising the authority in 31 U.S.C. 3351 et seq. to waive the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(o), in consultation with the OMB Director, in any case or class of cases for computer matching activities, to the extent permissible by law.\n(d)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, agency heads shall review and modify, as applicable, their relevant system of records notices under the Privacy Act of 1974 to include a “routine use” that allows for the disclosure of records to the Department of the Treasury for the purposes of identifying, preventing, or recouping fraud and improper payments, to the extent permissible by law.\n(e)  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the OMB Director, shall issue guidance to agency heads on the circumstances in which agency heads, to the extent permissible by law, may provide the Secretary of the Treasury with access to data necessary for the purposes of detecting and preventing fraud and improper payments, as well as data for payment information verification (and not, for example, data such as health records).\nSec. 4.  Implementation and Compliance of Payment Verification.  (a)  Agency heads, through designated agency officials (Certifying Officers or COs), who are responsible for verifying that disbursements made by the Federal Government are legal, proper, and correct, and for performing the duties in 31 U.S.C. 3528, shall comply with the disbursement requirements and instructions, including pre-certification requirements, published by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n(b)  The Secretary of the Treasury shall consider, as appropriate, issuing instructions to agencies to enforce the following pre-certification criteria for disbursement requests submitted by COs (Vouchers) before they are certified for payment by the CO:\n(i)     Funds are available at the time the obligation is incurred.  If an obligation is incurred when funds are not available, then the CO shall not certify the payment.\n(ii)    The amount of the payment and the name of the payee on the Voucher are correct, in conformance with the Department of the Treasury’s prescribed standard format.\n(iii)   A proper Social Security Number, Taxpayer Identification Number, Employer Identification Number, Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or Payee ID Number is provided for each payee on the Voucher, as applicable.\n(iv)    The appropriation or fund from which the payment will be made is available for the purpose set forth in the Voucher and indicated with the appropriate Treasury Account Symbol/Business Event Type Code.\n(v)     Payees are not deceased individuals, to the greatest extent permitted by law.\n(vi)    The account number provided on the Voucher is held at a financial institution and is open, valid, and belongs to the payee or valid designee of payee.\n(vii)   Contracts or agreements are referenced on the Voucher by providing the contract number, referred to as the Procurement Instrument Identifier, where applicable.\n(viii)  Financial assistance awards (non-aggregate) are referenced on the Voucher by providing the award number, referred to as the Federal Award Identification Number, where applicable.\n(ix)    For summary schedules, the payments on the Voucher are submitted in conformance with the Department of the Treasury prescribed standard formats for such schedules.\n(c)  Agency heads shall submit payment files other than with respect to same-day payments to the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary’s designee with sufficient lead time prior to the date of disbursement as determined by the Department of the Treasury and provided in the requirements and instructions issued pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, to allow for fraud and improper payment screening, to the extent permissible by law.  With respect to same-day payments, agency heads shall submit payment files to the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary’s designee as much in advance as reasonably practicable.\n(d)  In issuing requirements and instructions pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of the Treasury shall consider whether it would be appropriate to provide that the Department of the Treasury’s Chief Disbursing Officer return to the relevant agency for reconciliation any payments that do not pass the pre-certification verification processes established pursuant to section 3(a) of this order and notify the designated CO.\n(e)  The Secretary of the Treasury shall include in the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, or in other regulations or guidance, a transparent process for agencies to request exemptions from some or all of the payment verification requirements for specific payments or categories of payments.\nSec. 5.  Core Financial System Consolidation.  (a)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the OMB Director shall issue guidance that directs agencies described in 31 U.S.C. 901(b) (CFO Act agencies) to consolidate their core financial systems.\n(b)  As soon as practicable, but not later than 180 days of the date of this order, the OMB Director, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall issue guidance directing all non-CFO Act agencies to consolidate transactional financial management services under a single provider approved by the Department of the Treasury.\n(c)  As soon as practicable, all heads of CFO Act agencies shall use standard financial management solutions available through the Financial Management Marketplace, administered by the Financial Management Quality Service Management Office.\n(d)  Agency heads shall ensure that core financial systems comply with Federal accounting and financial reporting standards and relevant regulations, orders, guidance documents, policy statements, and other agency actions published by the Department of the Treasury from time to time.\nSec. 6.  Reduction of NTDOs.  (a)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury shall assess whether to maintain disbursing authority that it has delegated to agencies pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3321(b) and issue notices to revoke such delegations, as appropriate, in accordance with applicable law.\n(b)  The heads of agencies with disbursing authority under 31 U.S.C. 3321(c), including the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Supreme Court and other entities of the Federal Government outside the Executive Branch) will work with the Secretary of the Treasury to delegate the performance of their disbursing activities, other than with respect to classified payments, to the Department of the Treasury’s Chief Disbursing Officer in accordance with applicable law.\n(c)  Notwithstanding subsections (a) or (b) of this section, the Secretary of the Treasury may continue to delegate disbursing authority to NTDOs at other agencies when doing so would align with significant Government priorities.  Any remaining NTDOs are required to report daily to the Department of the Treasury’s centralized accounting and reporting system in accordance with then-current Department of the Treasury guidance and applicable law.\n(d)  The Secretary of the Treasury shall develop a plan to centralize and manage all payments previously disbursed by NTDOs, ensuring seamless continuity of Government payments.\n(e)  The Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with agency heads, shall establish a transition plan for agencies currently operating as NTDOs, including staffing adjustments, system integrations, and legal or regulatory modifications necessary for full consolidation.\n(f)  The heads of agencies with disbursing authority delegated to the agency under 33 U.S.C. 3321(b) shall decommission all internal payment systems and use the Department of the Treasury’s disbursement systems, except and to the extent authorized by the Department of the Treasury or otherwise required by applicable law.\nSec. 7.  Reporting and Implementation Requirements.  (a)  The heads of all agencies shall submit a compliance plan to the OMB Director within 90 days of the date of this order detailing their strategy for:\n(i)    transitioning disbursing authority to the Department of the Treasury, as applicable and as contemplated by this order;\n(ii)   updating and integrating systems with Department of the Treasury platforms;\n(iii)  procedures to verify payment information as contemplated by this order; and\n(iv)   transmitting information associated with improper payments to the Department of the Treasury in accordance with standards and reporting specifications established by the OMB Director in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury as contemplated by this order.\n(b)  The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit an implementation report to the President through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy within 180 days of the date of this order detailing progress on the matters set forth in this order.\n(c)  The Secretary of the Treasury and agency heads shall take all necessary steps to protect classified information and systems, as well as personally identifiable information and tax return information, through the implementation of this order.\nSec. 8.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

Part 208;\n(iii)  national security- or law enforcement-related activities where non-EFT transactions are necessary or desirable; and\n(iv)   other circumstances as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, as reflected in regulations or other guidance.\n(b)  Individuals or entities qualifying for an exception under this section or other applicable law shall be provided alternative payment options.Sec. 5.  Implementation and Compliance of Electronic Transactions.  (a)  The Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the heads of agencies, shall develop and implement a comprehensive public awareness campaign to inform Federal payment recipients of the transition to electronic payments, including guidance on accessing and setting up digital payment options.\n(b)  Agencies shall coordinate with the Department of the Treasury to facilitate a smooth transition to digital payments, ensuring that affected individuals and entities receive adequate support.\n(c)  The Secretary of the Treasury shall work with financial institutions, consumer groups, and other stakeholders to address financial access for unbanked and underbanked populations.\n(d)  The Secretary of the Treasury and the heads of agencies shall take all necessary steps to protect classified information and systems, as well as personally identifiable information and tax return information, through the implementation of this order.Sec. 6.  Reporting Requirements.  (a)  The heads of agencies shall submit a compliance plan to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget within 90 days of the date of this order detailing their strategy for eliminating paper-based transactions.\n(b)  The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit an implementation report to the President through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy within 180 days of the date of this order detailing progress on the matters set forth in this order.Sec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

Trump and his National Security team successfully killed terrorists who have targeted U.S. troops and disrupted one of the most consequential shipping routes in the world. This is a coordinated effort to distract from the successful actions taken by President Trump and his administration to make America’s enemies pay and keep Americans safe.\nThe Biden Administration sat back as a band of pirates — with precision-guided, Iran-provided weaponry — exacted a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world.\nIn fact, since 2023, Houthi terrorists attacked U.S. Navy warships 174 times and attacked commercial shipping vessels 145 times — and as a result, 75% of U.S.-flagged shipping has been forced to navigate the southern coast of Africa rather than through the Suez Canal.Biden’s weakness invited these unacceptable attacks — while President Trump put these terrorists on notice:\n- BIDEN: Removed the Houthis from the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.\n- TRUMP: Immediately re-designated the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n- BIDEN: Allowed the Houthis to attack U.S. Navy ships and shut down commercial traffic through the Red Sea — responding in feckless, pinprick “attacks.”\n- TRUMP: Launched successful, large-scale strikes against the Houthis, eliminating senior terrorists within the organization and putting the world on notice.\nThe Trump Administration’s actions to hold the Houthis accountable has been a massive success — and nothing can distract from that unrelenting action to keep Americans safe."

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in view of the national emergency declared with respect to Venezuela in Executive Order 13692 of March 8, 2015 (Blocking Property and Suspending Entry of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Venezuela), as continued most recently in the notice of February 27, 2025 (Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Venezuela), I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of the regime of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.  The activities of the Tren de Aragua gang, a transnational criminal organization originating in Venezuela and designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist organization, have intensified this threat, as highlighted in Proclamation 10903 of March 14, 2025 (Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua).  Furthermore, Venezuela’s ongoing destabilizing actions, including its support for illicit activities, necessitate further economic measures to protect United States interests.\nIn light of these circumstances, and to address the continued national emergency with respect to Venezuela that forms the basis for Executive Order 13692 and subsequent orders, I hereby order:\nSection 1.  Findings.  (a)  The Tren de Aragua gang, a transnational criminal organization with origins in Venezuela, has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States due to its extensive involvement in terrorist activities such as kidnapping and violent attacks, including the assassination of a Venezuelan opposition figure, that destabilize communities across the Western Hemisphere.  The prior administration’s open-borders policies facilitated the infiltration of the United States by members of Tren de Aragua, allowing these dangerous criminals to establish a foothold within United States cities and prey upon American citizens. The Maduro regime aided and facilitated the influx of Tren de Aragua members into the United States during the prior administration by failing to control its borders, permitting the gang’s operations to flourish within Venezuela, and refusing to take action against its members, thereby exacerbating the illegal immigration crisis.\n(b)  Existing sanctions on Venezuela, including those imposed in Executive Order 13692, Executive Order 13808 of August 24, 2017 (Imposing Additional Sanctions with Respect to the Situation in Venezuela), Executive Order 13850 of November 1, 2018 (Blocking Property of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation in Venezuela), and Executive Order 13884 of August 5, 2019 (Blocking Property of the Government of Venezuela), remain in effect.  The actions and policies of the Maduro regime that were the basis for those orders continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.  These actions include:\n(i)    The systematic undermining of democratic institutions through the suppression of free and fair elections and the illegitimate consolidation of power by the regime of Nicolás Maduro;\n(ii)   Endemic economic mismanagement and public corruption at the expense of the Venezuelan people and their prosperity;\n(iii)  The regime’s responsibility for the deepening humanitarian and public health crisis in Venezuela; and\n(iv)   The destabilization of the Western Hemisphere through the forced migration of millions of Venezuelans, imposing significant burdens on neighboring countries.\nSec. 2.  Imposition of Tariffs.  (a)  On or after April 2, 2025, a tariff of 25 percent may be imposed on all goods imported into the United States from any country that imports Venezuelan oil, whether directly from Venezuela or indirectly through third parties.  Duties imposed by this order will be supplemental to duties on imports already imposed pursuant to IEEPA, section 232 of the Trade Expansion of 1962, section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, or any other authority.\n(b)  The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the United States Trade Representative, is hereby authorized to determine in his discretion whether the tariff of 25 percent will be imposed on goods from any country that imports Venezuelan oil, directly or indirectly, on or after April 2, 2025.\n(c)  Once imposed on a country at the Secretary of State’s discretion, the tariff of 25 percent shall expire 1 year after the last date on which the country imported Venezuelan oil, or at an earlier date if the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the United States Trade Representative, so determines at his discretion.\nSec. 3.  Administration and Enforcement.  (a)  The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the United States Trade Representative, is hereby authorized to impose the tariffs established by this order.\n(b)  The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, is hereby authorized to:\n(i)    Determine whether a country has imported Venezuelan oil, directly or indirectly;\n(ii)   Issue regulations, guidance, and determinations as necessary to implement this order;\n(iii)  Coordinate with the heads of other executive departments and agencies to ensure compliance; and\n(iv)   Take any additional actions consistent with applicable law to carry out the purposes of this order.\n(c)  Any prior Presidential Proclamation, Executive Order, or other Presidential directive or guidance that is inconsistent with the direction in this order is hereby terminated, suspended, or modified to the extent necessary to give full effect to this order.\n(d)  Any other Presidential Proclamation, Executive Order, or other Presidential directive or guidance that applies to Venezuela or a country subject to a tariff under section 2 of this order remains in full effect, except to the extent specified in subsection (c) of this section.\n(e)  If the Secretary of State, at his discretion, decides to impose a tariff under section 2 of this order on China, that tariff shall also apply to both the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macau Special Administrative Region, as a measure to reduce the risk of transshipment and evasion.\nSec. 4.  Reporting and Review.  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce shall submit periodic reports to the President, within 180 days of the date of this order and no less than every 180 days thereafter, assessing the effectiveness of the tariffs described in this order and the ongoing conduct of the Maduro regime.\nSec. 5.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this order:\n(a)  The term “Venezuelan oil” means crude oil or petroleum products extracted, refined, or exported from Venezuela, regardless of the nationality of the entity involved in the production or sale of such crude oil or petroleum products.\n(b)  The term “indirectly” includes purchases of Venezuelan oil through intermediaries or third countries where the origin of the oil can reasonably be traced to Venezuela, as determined by the Secretary of Commerce.\nSec. 6.  Effective Date.  This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 2, 2025.\nSec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   The authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  The functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J. TRUMP\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nMarch 24, 2025."

    "content": "BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAA PROCLAMATION\nOn March 25, 1821, fueled by the rallying cry, “Freedom or Death,” Greek revolutionaries began a war for independence against the Ottoman Empire.  The hard-fought victory established a sovereign Greek state and a national homeland for Greece.  On the 204th anniversary of Greek Independence Day, we honor this heroic fight for freedom, and the enduring democratic ideals that continue to inspire the world.\nAmerica is inextricably tied to both ancient and modern Greece.  We are tethered by history and tradition, the struggle for self-governance, emancipation, and rebirth.  Our Founding Fathers drew inspiration from Greek philosophers and statesmen to form the tenets of our new Republic, now enshrined in our Constitution.  Our national character has been shaped, in part, by the indelible impact of Greek influence in the arts and architecture, language and literature, and academia and military tradition.  Today, across the United States, generations of Greek Americans infuse our neighborhoods and communities with a rich legacy of cultural traditions, and a heritage of family, faith, hospitality, and civic responsibility.\nGreece is one of our Nation’s oldest friends, strategic partners, and a valued NATO ally.  We appreciate the support of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in our economic and diplomatic partnership as we forge opportunities for collaboration in key sectors including energy, science, technology, shipping, logistics, and defense.  The permanent presence of naval forces in Souda Bay and bilateral training events enhance warfighting capabilities and reflect our mutual commitment to joint military cooperation as a cornerstone of security and stability in Europe.\nOn this day, we pause to celebrate Hellenic independence, people of Greek heritage worldwide, and the abiding kinship of likeminded nations who cherish democracy, patriotism, prosperity, and peace.NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2025, as Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.  I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.\nDONALD J. TRUMP"

    "content": "This morning, officials from the Trump Administration took to the airwaves to update the American people on another week of success — from reforming education to ensuring the safety and security of the American people.\nHere’s what you missed:\n- On the Trump Administration’s goal for education: “Our goal is to make sure that we are providing the best education for students in our country. We cannot be last in the world in education … It is up to us and our responsibility to make sure we are giving them the best access to education.”\n- On local control in education: “Am I, the secretary of education sitting in Washington, going to have a view into a school room where a teacher is trying to take care of a student with special needs? Or is that going to happen better at the local level?”\n- On school choice: “[President Trump] wants to make sure that there is equal access to quality education for every student in our country — which is why he is such a proponent of school choice … He doesn’t believe that ANY child should be trapped in a failing school.”\n- On overreach by activist judges: “This is an out-of-control judge … trying to control our entire foreign policy, and he cannot do it… There are 261 reasons why Americans are safer today, and that’s because those people are now in an El Salvador prison … We are going to follow the law and we are going to protect Americans.”\n- On strikes against Houthi terrorists in Yemen: “75% of our U.S.-flagged shipping now has to go around the southern coast of Africa rather than going through the Suez Canal. Keeping the sea lanes open, keeping trade and commerce open, is a fundamental aspect of our national security. The last administration was not effective. The Trump Administration and President Trump have decided to do something much harder, much tougher.”\n- On Iran’s nuclear program: “Iran has to give up its program in a way that the entire world can see. As President Trump has said, this is coming to a head. All options are on the table, and it is time for Iran to walk away completely from its desire to have a nuclear weapon.”\n- On talks to end the war in Ukraine: “I’m not sure how anyone would expect an end to a conflict when you’re not communicating … [President Trump’s] philosophy of peace through strength brings people to the table to clear up misconceptions and to get peace deals done.”\n- On deporting illegal immigrant Tren de Aragua gang members: “We’re actually using the laws on the books to enforce immigration law and secure the border … We’re not making this up. Everything we’ve done is based on a statute that was enacted by Congress and signed by a president.”\n- On illegal border crossings: “We’ll use these assets as long as we can until we get to the point that we have total operational control of the border and national security threats have no avenue into this country.”"

    "content": "MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\nTHE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY\nSUBJECT:      Preventing Abuses of the Legal System and the Federal Court\nLawyers and law firms that engage in actions that violate the laws of the United States or rules governing attorney conduct must be efficiently and effectively held accountable.  Accountability is especially important when misconduct by lawyers and law firms threatens our national security, homeland security, public safety, or election integrity.Recent examples of grossly unethical misconduct are far too common.  For instance, in 2016, Marc Elias, founder and chair of Elias Law Group LLP, was deeply involved in the creation of a false “dossier” by a foreign national designed to provide a fraudulent basis for Federal law enforcement to investigate a Presidential candidate in order to alter the outcome of the Presidential election.  Elias also intentionally sought to conceal the role of his client — failed Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton — in the dossier. The immigration system — where rampant fraud and meritless claims have supplanted the constitutional and lawful bases upon which the President exercises core powers under Article II of the United States Constitution — is likewise replete with examples of unscrupulous behavior by attorneys and law firms.  For instance, the immigration bar, and powerful Big Law pro bono practices, frequently coach clients to conceal their past or lie about their circumstances when asserting their asylum claims, all in an attempt to circumvent immigration policies enacted to protect our national security and deceive the immigration authorities and courts into granting them undeserved relief.  Gathering the necessary information to refute these fraudulent claims imposes an enormous burden on the Federal Government.  And this fraud in turn undermines the integrity of our immigration laws and the legal profession more broadly — to say nothing of the undeniable, tragic consequences of the resulting mass illegal immigration, whether in terms of heinous crimes against innocent victims like Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray, or Rachel Morin, or the enormous drain on taxpayer resources intended for Americans. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 prohibits attorneys from engaging in certain unethical conduct in Federal courts.  Attorneys must not present legal filings “for improper purpose[s],” including “to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.”  FRCP 11(b)(1).  Attorneys must ensure that legal arguments are “warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law.”  FRCP 11(b)(2).  And attorneys must ensure that their statements about facts are “reasonably based” on evidentiary support, or a belief that such evidence actually exists.  FRCP 11(b)(3)-(b)(4).  When these commands are violated, opposing parties are authorized to file a motion for sanctions.  FRCP 11(c).  The text of the rule specifically addresses and provides for sanctions for attorneys and their firms as well as for recalcitrant parties given the solemn obligation that attorneys have to respect the rule of law and uphold our Nation’s legal system with integrity.  Furthermore, Rule 3.1 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct provides that, “A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.”Unfortunately, far too many attorneys and law firms have long ignored these requirements when litigating against the Federal Government or in pursuing baseless partisan attacks.  To address these concerns, I hereby direct the Attorney General to seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States or in matters before executive departments and agencies of the United States.I further direct the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize enforcement of their respective regulations governing attorney conduct and discipline.  See, e.g., 8 C.F.R. 292.1 et seq.; 8 C.F.R. 1003.101 et seq.; 8 C.F.R. 1292.19.I further direct the Attorney General to take all appropriate action to refer for disciplinary action any attorney whose conduct in Federal court or before any component of the Federal Government appears to violate professional conduct rules, including rules governing meritorious claims and contentions, and particularly in cases that implicate national security, homeland security, public safety, or election integrity.  In complying with this directive, the Attorney General shall consider the ethical duties that law partners have when supervising junior attorneys, including imputing the ethical misconduct of junior attorneys to partners or the law firm when appropriate.I further direct that, when the Attorney General determines that conduct by an attorney or law firm in litigation against the Federal Government warrants seeking sanctions or other disciplinary action, the Attorney General shall, in consultation with any relevant senior executive official, recommend to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, additional steps that may be taken, including reassessment of security clearances held by the attorney or termination of any Federal contract for which the relevant attorney or law firm has been hired to perform services.I further direct the Attorney General, in consultation with any relevant senior executive official, to review conduct by attorneys or their law firms in litigation against the Federal Government over the last 8 years.  If the Attorney General identifies misconduct that may warrant additional action, such as filing frivolous litigation or engaging in fraudulent practices, the Attorney General is directed to recommend to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, additional steps that may be taken, including reassessment of security clearances held by the attorney, termination of any contract for which the relevant attorney or law firm has been hired to perform services, or any other appropriate actions.Law firms and individual attorneys have a great power, and obligation, to serve the rule of law, justice, and order.  The Attorney General, alongside the Counsel to the President, shall report to the President periodically on improvements by firms to capture this hopeful vision."

Trump’s unrelenting pursuit of American manufacturing dominance.\nThe company said it represents a “25% increase in investment compared to the previous four years” and builds on their “already elevated U.S. investment levels resulting from the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act” under President Trump’s leadership.\nCall it the Trump Effect.

    "content": "Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order to officially begin the process of closing the Department of Education. After more than four decades and over $3 trillion spent with virtually nothing to show for it, President Trump’s bold plan will return education back where it belongs — with the states.\nPresident Trump’s executive action was met with immediate praise:\nGov. Greg Abbott: “At the White House right now. Headed to see President @realDonaldTrump return control of education back to the states—where it belongs.”\nGov. Mike Braun: “Education is a state and local responsibility. I support President Trump’s bold action to return education to where it belongs and to put parents in the driver’s seat of their children’s education. Indiana is leading the way, having jumped from a middle of the pack state to sixth in the nation in reading. Hoosiers know what our students need to succeed better than bureaucrats in D.C.”\nGov. Mike DeWine: “Every student, family, and community is different. … By giving states more authority over education, we will have the flexibility to focus our efforts on tailoring an educational experience that is best for our children and that meets Ohio’s needs, rather than trying to chase federal priorities.”\nGov. Jeff Landry: “The United States spends the most on education, yet we are ranked at the bottom of nearly every poll. The time for change is NOW! Thank you President @realDonaldTrump for returning education where it belongs— the states!”\nGov. Bill Lee: “Proud to be at the White House today as President @realDonaldTrump delivers on his promise to return education to the states & parents.”\nGov. Joe Lombardo: “Today, President Donald Trump delivered one of the most influential reforms yet of his presidency: reducing the size of the Department of Education and returning education back to state control. With his Executive Order, President Trump has boldly reimagined what education can – and should – look like in our country.”\nGov. Kim Reynolds: “Education decisions should be made by those who know students best—parents, teachers, and local communities. Thank you, President @realDonaldTrump and @EDSecMcMahon, for your leadership and commitment to education freedom. It was an honor to attend today’s historic signing – Iowa stands ready!”\nGov. Larry Rhoden: “I am glad to have a president who recognizes that South Dakota can make better decisions for our kids than DC ever could. Thank you to @realDonaldTrump for signing an Executive Order that returns authority over education to the states and the people.”\nGov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders: “President @realDonaldTrump knows the one-size-fits-all approach will never meet the needs of every child.   Thank you, Mr. President for fighting for parents and students across the country!”\nGov. Kevin Stitt: “Today is a great day to dismantle the Department of Education.”\nGov. Glenn Youngkin: “Virginia is ready to take full responsibility for K-12 education. We have implemented a high-expectations agenda that sets rigorous standards, holds schools accountable for results and prioritizes resources to the students and schools that need the most support. We welcome the federal government’s shift of responsibility to the states—and we are grateful that President Trump’s executive order does just that. The EO also makes it clear that there will be no discrimination in the classrooms. We will continue to ensure every student graduates career-, college-, or military-ready.”\nSenate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy: “I agree with President Trump that the Department of Education has failed its mission. Since the Department can only be shut down with Congressional approval, I will support the President’s goals by submitting legislation to accomplish this as soon as possible.”\nSen. John Barrasso: “President Trump is improving America’s education system. The true strength of our education system lies with the states and our local communities. Today’s executive order sidelines the Washington bureaucracy and puts Wyoming parents in the driver’s seat when it comes to their child’s education.”\nSen. Marsha Blackburn: “President Trump has my full support in eliminating the Department of Education. Bring the money back to states and with the students.”\nSen. John Cornyn: “I applaud this bold move by @POTUS and @EDSecMcMahon to give education policy back to state & local educators and parents. Texas is already a leader in empowering parents, & this is the right move by POTUS to support children over unions, unlike the Biden administration”\nSen. Markwayne Mullin: “Parents know the truth, and the data is clear: DC control of education is NOT working. One size doesn’t fit all. @POTUS is empowering families, teachers, and local communities to improve outcomes and create greater opportunities for our students. Promises made, promises kept.”\nSen. Rand Paul: “My father introduced legislation to eliminate the Dept of Education in the early 1980s. Rep. Massie continued the same bill – one sentence – and I’ve introduced the Senate version.  Thanks to President Trump for working to return education to the states.”\nSen. Pete Ricketts: “Federal education policy should empower parents, states, and local school districts, not federal bureaucrats. That’s what is happening in this administration. @POTUS is refocusing the Education Department on its core missions and pushing power back to the state and local level.”\nSen. Mike Rounds: “The federal BUREACRACY of Education has never educated a single student. It’s time to shut it down. Today’s news is a step in the right direction. Congress should follow the executive branch’s lead and act accordingly. I am working on legislation that would return education decisions to states and local school districts while maintaining important programs like special education and Title I. We are discussing this legislation with Secretary McMahon and we believe there is a very good path forward.”\nSen. Rick Scott: “As the federal Department of Education has grown, student performance has consistently declined. @POTUS & @EDSecMcMahon’s decisive action will empower parents, teachers & students to make decisions that drive students’ success.”\nSen. Tommy Tuberville: “The federal government doesn’t belong in the classroom, plain and simple. Promises made, promises kept.”\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: “For many decades, the federal Department of Education has failed our students, families, and teachers. Education is best administered by parents and teachers and those closest to students, not bureaucrats in Washington, DC. President Trump is keeping his promise and returning education to the states.”\nChairwoman Lisa McClain: “The U.S. Department of Education has been pushing woke policies for far too long. There is too much bloated federal bureaucracy. Despite more money being spent, test scores have not improved. We should focus the dollars on the students, not administrators. I look forward to working with @POTUS and @EdSecMcMahon to improve education in America.”\nHouse Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Tim Walberg: “The key to improving education is empowering parents and students and reducing the role of Washington bureaucrats. Over the last four years, the nation has seen the results of empowering the Department of Education. … We now have a secretary of education, Linda McMahon, who understands the importance of getting the federal government out of the way. And I look forward to working alongside her to get the federal government off the backs of students, families, educators, and taxpayers. Bottom line, the Department of Education has failed to deliver results for America’s students and today’s actions by the Trump administration will help ensure our nation’s youth are put first.”\nRep. Brian Babin: “President Trump just took education OUT of the hands of woke elites and gave it BACK to parents! His executive order ensures states, NOT DC, make decisions for our kids.”\nRep. Jim Baird: “This Executive Order is a monumental step in making school choice a reality for every family, improving educational outcomes for our students, empowering parents, and making American education great again.”\nRep. Stephanie Bice: “Today’s executive order from @POTUS empowers parents and renews commitments to put the educational needs of our children above the desires of Washington bureaucrats. This executive order will reduce regulations and streamline the process of sending funding to states and localities.”\nRep. Andy Biggs: “Taxpayer funding for public schools is at an all-time high, but test scores are at an all-time low. The radical Biden-Harris regime weaponized the Department of Education against their opponents. President Trump is rightfully returning power to the States and parents.”\nRep. Ben Cline: “President Trump’s Executive Order to begin closing the federal education department puts parents and students first by restoring local control over education. The Department of Education has spent too long pushing woke policies instead of focusing on student success.”\nRep. Michael Cloud: “The Department of Education has failed to actually educate our children for decades—instead pushing CRT and allowing boys in girls’ bathrooms. Dismantling this bureaucracy and returning power to states and parents is crucial to make America the best in world in education again.”\nRep. Andrew Clyde: “President Trump knows we can—and must—do better. It all starts with dismantling the Department of Education.”\nRep. Eli Crane: “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. The Department of Education has failed our nation’s students for decades. It’s time to chart a new path. Thank you to President Trump for having the courage to do this.”\nRep. Mike Collins: “The federal government’s involvement in schools has been a failure and never should have started. I strongly support @POTUS’s Executive Order to put education back in the hands of parents, states, and communities, rather than failing federal systems.”\nRep. Jeff Crank: “I have been incredibly vocal in my support for eliminating the Department of Education. I applaud @POTUS Trump’s decision in returning the power of education decisions to parents and local governments, where it rightfully belongs.”\nRep. Byron Donalds: “@usedgov has FAILED. They prioritized bureaucracy over the success of our kids. Thank you @realDonaldTrump for signing this historic EO. It’s time to return education to the states & in Florida, we will ensure our kids are not just at grade-level, but that they’re PROFICIENT.”\nRep. Tom Emmer: “The best education is closest to the child. This is a win for America’s children! Thank you, @POTUS.”\nRep. Chuck Edwards: “.@POTUS just signed an executive order to close the Department of Education, finally returning education authority back to the states and parents who know what their student needs to succeed best. The historically high tax dollars funding the department have not paid off, with repeatedly low test scores among students. This order puts the interests of our youth first by getting rid of the bureaucracies that hinder quality education.”\nRep. Russell Fry: “Since the creation of @usedgov, it has spent over $3 TRILLION! And for what? America has some of the lowest test and literacy scores in the world. @POTUS is giving the power of the purse back to the people closest to our children—states and parents.”\nRep. Virginia Foxx: “Love to see it.”\nRep. Lance Gooden: “The Department of Education does not run a single school or teach a single student. Yet, the department spent $268 billion last year. I applaud President Trump’s plan to dismantle this rampant bureaucracy and return power to parents!”\nRep. Andy Harris: “The Department of Education has failed its mission because it is promoting everything EXCEPT reading, writing, and arithmetic. President Trump is returning education back to the states and giving power to parents and students.”\nRep. Mark Harris: “Despite endless taxpayer dollars being poured into the Department of Education, it has utterly failed its mission. Our education system has gotten worse. National test scores show that many students have been left behind. President Trump is right — the Department of Education must go. I promise to use every tool at my disposal to help him return the reins to parents and local teachers. They know what’s best for our nation’s children, not unelected bureaucrats in the Swamp. Let’s make education great again!”\nRep. Diana Harshbarger: “President Trump’s executive order directing the Secretary of Education to take all necessary steps to permanently close the Department of Education is HUGE. Something as important as our children’s education should be in the hands of states and parents—not the federal government—which has proven to be nothing more than a money pit with no positive effects on students!”\nRep. Erin Houchin: “President Trump’s executive order to scale down the federal Department of Education will return control of education to the states and local communities. This will empower parents and families to make decisions about students’ education rather than bureaucrats in Washington. The federal DOE has failed to deliver results for our students for decades. This order and legislation to follow will prioritize academic excellence, innovation, and parental choice and will reduce federal overreach in education. It is a win for families and the future of America’s students!”\nRep. John James: “It’s official: @POTUS has signed an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education! Educational outcomes have been disastrous since the Department’s creation, and it’s time we fully returned the decision-making authority back to the states!”\nRep. Jim Jordan: “Democrats want federal bureaucrats to control your child’s school. Republicans want to give parents the choice to do what’s best for their children.”\nRep. Nancy Mace: “Thank you President Trump for returning education back to the states, where it belongs.”\nRep. Addison McDowell: “There it is – @realDonaldTrump delivering on yet another promise! Under the Department of Education’s watch, math and reading scores are at historic lows. It’s time for change. President Trump is putting children and parents first.”\nRep. Mary Miller: “Today is a historic day for students and parents across America. As a mother of seven homeschooled children, I applaud President Trump for completing his promise to dismantle the Department of Education and put parents back in control. For far too long, our students have been left behind by woke, unaccountable Washington bureaucrats and a bloated system failing them academically. Now, our country has the opportunity to expand educational freedom, increase opportunities for families, and unlock our full potential.”\nRep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks: “For years, the DOE has pushed woke policies over merit, special interests over students. All while math and reading at grade level has plummeted. That era is over. States, local governments, and Iowa parents know our students’ needs better than DC bureaucrats.   I remain committed to working with President Trump to advance education in America while ensuring FAFSA is reformed and Pell Grants are uninterrupted.”\nRep. Barry Moore: “President Trump continues to deliver on the promises he made to the American people. This is a massive step toward making the United States the standard in education on the world stage once again!”\nRep. Troy Nehls: “President Trump just signed an executive order to return power over education back to the states and families—where it belongs. Unelected bureaucrats should not have power over our children’s education. States and families should.”\nRep. Ralph Norman: “Say bye to overregulation and hello to STATES deciding what goes on in schools. Essential programs within the @usedgov will be maintained & efficiency will be restored!!”\nRep. Andy Ogles: “For far too long the Department of Education has been poisoning the minds of students by injecting woke, anti-America curriculum into our schools. It has overseen the sharpest decline in American literacy and international rankings. Thank you, @POTUS, for taking steps to dismantle the Dept. of Ed and hand education back to the states.”\nRep. Burgess Owens: “The Education Department was born out of a deal between President Carter and the teachers unions to hand education policy to a class of bureaucrats who care more about their own power than educating children. It’s time to put states in charge and parents in the driver’s seat.”\nRep. Scott Perry: “The Constitution provides no mandate for the federal government to be involved in education — for a reason.   The responsibility of educating our children was rightfully entrusted to the States, and I support its return to them — while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which the American People rely.    The Department of Education has spent TRILLIONS since 1980, without improving student achievement. Change is long overdue.”\nRep. August Pfluger: “We all want the same thing: a strong education system that puts the needs of our children first. Unfortunately, the Biden administration weaponized the Department of Education resulting in taxpayer funding for public schools being at an all-time high, while test scores are at an all-time low. Today’s executive order returns power to the states and parents to decide what goes on in schools.”\nRep. Chip Roy: “A VICTORY for students, teachers, and parents. A LOSS for union bosses and bureaucrats.”\nRep. Keith Self: “Groundbreaking news for every parent and student in America:   Washington bureaucrats will no longer wield education authority and enact progressive social experiments on your children.   Power over education is going back to YOUR state and to YOUR family! Thank you, President Trump for keeping your promise!”\nRep. Adrian Smith: “We owe it to American students to examine whether they are better off since the Department of Education’s inception more than a half-century ago. Just since 2000, federal spending has ballooned 649 percent while student proficiencies and the number of ED employees have declined. It’s clear such ineffectiveness is not worth such a monumental expense. Parents deserve a greater voice in the classroom, and the federal government should return this issue to the states.”\nRep. Dale Strong: “I’ve long supported abolishing the Department of Education to prioritize students over bureaucracy. President Trump took the first step today with his Executive Order to return decision-making power to the states and parents. I will work with him to make sure this gets done for our parents and kids.”\nRep. Greg Steube: “President Trump’s executive order was a great first step. Congress must follow @POTUS’ lead by abolishing the Department of Education once and for all.”\nRep. Marlin Stutzman: “The federalist system of government our country was founded upon gives states the distinct privilege to make laws that are best for their residents. When it comes to an issue as important as the education of our children, no one knows better than those closest to them. Unelected federal bureaucrats who have minimal knowledge of the real needs of the future generation have only wasted tax dollars and made the education our kids receive worse.  President Trump and Secretary McMahon are putting education back to where it belongs – with our states.”\nRep. Tom Tiffany: “President Trump is returning control of education to parents & local communities. Washington bureaucrats have spent trillions since creating the Department of Ed, yet student achievement has declined. It’s time to give our children the education they need to succeed.”\nRep. William Timmons: “Under the Biden Administration, the Department of Education wasted more than $1 billion in grants focused on entrenching radical ideologies in education. Under President Trump’s administration, Taxpayers will no longer be burdened with progressive social experiments and obsolete programs.”\nRep. Randy Weber: “President Trump just put parents back in the driver’s seat on education! No more DC bureaucrats calling the shots—power is returning to the states where it belongs. A huge win for students, parents, and freedom!”\nRep. Daniel Webster: “President @realDonaldTrump is fighting to take education out of Washington bureaucrats hands and give it back to parents! @POTUS’s plan will cut waste, expand school choice, and put the education of America’s children first!”\nRep. Tim Walberg: “I was honored to be on hand as @realDonaldTrump empowers students, parents, and teachers over bureaucrats”\nRep. Rudy Yakym: “The Department of Education has failed its mission — spending more while student test scores don’t improve. Putting control back in the hands of states means putting parents back in charge and empowering families, teachers, and communities to create better opportunities for our kids’ futures.”\nOklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters: “For too long, the federal government has weaponized education, using it to push radical, leftist ideology while stripping parents of their rights and directing funds to union bosses President Trump’s executive order marks a pivotal moment in American history, the federal money grab ends today.”\nVirginia Secretary of Education Aimee Rogstad Guidera: “Virginians know best what Virginia students need and what works here in Virginia, and accordingly, we should be both responsible and accountable for results to the families of the Commonwealth. T he President’s Executive Order ensures that federal dollars will arrive in Virginia with less red tape and bureaucracy and allow the State Board of Education, Virginia Department of Education, and local school divisions to invest those resources in the most efficient and effective ways that lead to the ultimate goal of improving student outcomes.”\nVirginia Board of Education President Grace Creasey: “President Trump’s executive order to return education leadership to the states empowers parents and reduces federal overreach. For too long, bureaucrats in Washington have dictated one-size-fits-all policies that fail to address the unique needs of the Commonwealth’s students and schools. Returning decision-making authority and funding to the states can foster innovation, accountability, and better educational outcomes. This is about putting parents and state and local leaders back in charge of education.”\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton: “I’m proud to stand with @POTUS as he returns education back to the states and empowers parents and students, not federal bureaucrats.”\nAmerica First Policy Institute Chair Erika Donalds: “President Trump’s bold action to return control of education to states and local communities marks a pivotal moment for American families. … By eliminating federal overreach in education, we can foster an environment where innovation thrives, parents have greater choice, and students receive the high-quality education they deserve. This move will allow states to tailor educational approaches to their unique needs, free from one-size-fits-all federal mandates, and voters can hold their state and local elected officials accountable for the resulting academic outcomes.”\nHeritage Foundation President Dr. Kevin Roberts: “From the moment it was created, the Department of Education was a mistake. It was founded on the false premise that unelected bureaucrats in Washington know better than parents and local communities when it comes to educating children. For decades, it has funneled billions of taxpayer dollars into a failing system—one that prioritizes leftist indoctrination over academic excellence, all while student achievement stagnates and America falls further behind. As a fifth-generation educator—a professor, college president, and founder of a classical school—I’ve seen firsthand what actually works: empowering parents, keeping decision-making at the local level, and ensuring that funding follows students, not bureaucracies. Now, President Trump is once again proving he keeps his promises. He’s putting America first, restoring common sense, and dismantling the bloated, ideological bureaucracies that have hollowed out our institutions—starting with the Department of Education.”\nCenter for Education Policy Director Lindsey Burke: “This is a tremendous step toward restoring education control to states, localities, and parents … Since the Department’s creation in 1980, inflation-adjusted federal education spending has more than doubled, yet student learning outcomes have remained flat, achievement gaps have persisted, and college prices have soared. Federal bureaucrats’ central planning cannot compare to the expertise that parents have about the needs of their own children. I applaud the Trump administration for taking steps to finally bring the agency’s closure to fruition.”\nDiscovery Institute’s American Center for Transforming Education Senior Fellow Dr. Keri D. Ingraham: “With today’s executive order, President Trump is delivering on his promise to the American people to dismantle the ineffective and bureaucracy-ridden U.S. Department of Education and return education to the states where it rightfully belongs. It is a historic day in our nation that takes us one step closer to the goal of education freedom for all families nationwide.”\nACE Scholarships CEO Norton Rainey: “Education should be focused on our children. But too often, it’s hijacked by special interests and those more concerned with advancing their own agendas than serving the best interests of students. For 40 years, the Department of Education’s K-12 efforts have been, at best, a wasteful distraction. It’s time for a new approach that puts children first by increasing choice and empowering parents instead of Washington bureaucrats.”\nAmerican Federation for Children CEO Tommy Schultz: “With this executive order, President Trump continues taking steps to fulfill his campaign promises on education, and now it is time for Congress to send school choice legislation to his desk so that he can fulfill his other mandate to the voters. As soon as President Trump signs this executive order directing the end of the federal Department of Education, and later signs the Educational Choice for Children Act into law, he will have both brought down a failed bureaucratic machine in DC, and brought school choice to every state.”\nAmerican Principles Project President Terry Schilling: “The Department of Education has drastically failed its core mission. Instead of improving student outcomes, it has become a bloated bureaucratic mess that wastes billions of tax dollars and has been weaponized by the far left to inject DEI and radical gender ideology into classrooms and sports fields across this country. As a dad who had to pull his kids out of public schools because of horrific educational outcomes, harmful ideology, and rejection of all parental input, I know first-hand the damage that our failing schools have on our kids. We cannot continue down the path we’ve been on for the last 50 years – it’s insanity. I am very thankful that President Trump recognizes the Department’s shortcomings and is going to dismantle this ineffective agency.”\nDefense of Freedom Institute: “The Department’s rules and burdens have hurt, not helped, students. Despite spending $3 trillion over 45 years, the Department has overseen the cratering of academic progress and achievement in the United States. We applaud President Trump and Secretary McMahon for their continued commitment to enforcing our civil rights laws and funding for low-income students and students with disabilities.”\nAmerican Legislative Exchange Council CEO Lisa B. Nelson: “President Trump’s bold vision to shrink the federal bureaucracy within the Department of Education and restore authority to the states marks a long-overdue return of constitutional order. This is the natural, unstoppable evolution of the parental empowerment movement sparked amid the pandemic lockdowns. The states are ready for it, and they’ve been clamoring for it. This executive order is a fundamental step forward in the American education revolution. We fully support President Trump’s leadership in eliminating wasteful, bureaucratic mandates that push political agendas and divert taxpayer funds away from students. By putting the states back in charge of this funding, students, families, and teachers will be put first – rather than the bloated bureaucracy in Washington, DC.”\nFreedom Foundation CEO Aaron Withe: “The Department of Education has failed America’s children, parents, and communities for more than four decades. … Our Founders understood that decisions about how to education children are best made by those closest to them—parents, local educators, and community leaders who understand their unique needs and values. By eliminating this unnecessary federal department, we have the opportunity to free states and local districts from burdensome regulations and finally shrink the excessive power of teachers unions.”\nThe Center for Education Reform: “This long-overdue shift empowers parents, educators, and local communities – those who truly understand the needs of students – to lead the way in shaping the future of education.”\nMoms for Liberty: “President Trump is taking important steps to restore education to where it should be: in the hands of educators who are closest to students in their classrooms across the country.”\nIndependent Women’s Forum Senior Legal Analyst Inez Stepman: “Starting the process to shutting down the Department of Education is the beginning of the end of an error. … The big sum of money that paid these bureaucrats and their six-figure salaries will now flow back to state education systems, where it can be used for what the American people think of as education: for students, teachers, and classrooms.”\nManhattan Institute Senior Fellow Christopher Rufo: “This is the culmination of a long campaign. Republicans have promised to abolish the Department of Education for almost fifty years, but only President Trump is getting it done. An incredible moment in history.”\nSchool Choice Activist Corey DeAngelis: “Make Education Great Again.”"

    "content": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nOur Nation proudly commemorates the 250th anniversary of Patrick Henry’s address to the Second Virginia Convention — a seminal moment in our great American story and a fateful turning point in America’s epic struggle for Independence.\nOn March 23, 1775, Patrick Henry rose to the pulpit of St. John’s Church in Richmond, Virginia, to speak those immortal words that remain etched upon every American heart:  “Give me Liberty, or give me death!”\nIn the wake of escalating tensions between the Patriots and the Redcoats, Henry delivered this stirring address before more than 100 delegates, including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and many of the statesmen who would go on to sign the Declaration of Independence.  Following the bloody Boston Massacre and the British Parliament’s authoritarian imposition of the Intolerable Acts — which closed the Boston Harbor and stripped New England Colonists of their right to self-govern — American leaders deliberated whether to continue their pursuit of peace, or as a final recourse, to take up arms in the rebellion.\nWith British tyranny on the rise and American confidence in retreat, the Second Virginia Convention assembled.  Patrick Henry, a respected lawyer who had recently served as a delegate to the Continental Congress, arrived at the Convention with one goal in mind:  to galvanize militiamen into securing “our inestimable rights and liberties, from those further violations with which they are threatened.”\nSome members cautioned against such decisive action, insisting that peaceful reconciliation was still possible, but as Henry listened, he grew more impatient.  A Baptist minister who observed the proceedings later recalled that he had “an unearthly fire burning in his eye.”  Overcome with righteous indignation, Henry rose from his seat with no notes in hand, boldly beseeching his fellow Virginians:  “If we wish to be free… we must fight!”\nAt a moment when America’s fate hung in the balance, Henry’s words sparked daring action in the souls of patriots, fortified the cause of freedom, and set America on the path to ultimate triumph over forces of tyranny and oppression.  By a narrow margin, the Second Virginia Convention passed the resolution to form a militia — the first critical step to Independence.\n“It is not now easy to say what we should have done without Patrick Henry,” Thomas Jefferson later wrote. “He was before us all in maintaining the spirit of the Revolution.”\nAs we approach the 250th anniversary of our Nation’s Independence on July 4, 2026, we look to Patrick Henry, a son of the frontier, the first and sixth Governor of Virginia, an unflinching advocate for American Independence, and a true man of his moment.  Today, we invoke his courage, we honor his legacy, and we fearlessly summon the spirit of 1776 to build a future that we will be proud to impart on our children.  Like Patrick Henry and the giants of American liberty who came before us, now is our time to ring that great bell of American freedom and to propel our Nation into a new and radiant golden age.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 23, 2025, as a day in celebration of the 250th anniversary of Patrick Henry’s speech to the Second Virginia Convention.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this\ntwentieth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.\nDONALD J.

Trump signed an Executive Order consolidating federal procurement for common goods and services in the General Services Administration (GSA)—the agency designed to conduct procurement—which will eliminate waste, inefficiencies, and duplication and enable agencies to focus on their core mission of delivering excellent services to the American people.\n- Since January 20th, 2025, GSA has coordinated the termination or economization of over 6,000 contracts across the federal government.  This Executive Order expands upon those efforts by directing:Agency Heads to submit proposals to GSA for consolidating domestic procurement functions for common goods and services within GSA, the agency with expertise in such procurement.GSA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop a comprehensive plan for consolidating common goods and services procurement across the government to eliminate waste and duplication, while delivering the best possible services to the

to designate GSA as the executive agent for the administration of government-wide acquisition contracts.\nRESTORING COMMON SENSE TO ACQUISITION: President Trump believes that a streamlined, centralized approach to procurement is essential to ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and efficiently.\n- The government spends about $490 billion per year on federal contracts for common goods and services, making it the largest buyer of goods and services in the world.\n- For too long, agencies have independently purchased office productivity software, leading to numerous challenges and inefficiencies, including pricing inconsistencies.For example, the cost of a comprehensive suite of Microsoft Office 365 services could vary between agencies by more than $200 per license.\n\nConsolidating the acquisition of this software in GSA could result in more than $100M in savings per year.\n- For example, the cost of a comprehensive suite of Microsoft Office 365 services could vary between agencies by more than $200 per license.\n- Consolidating the acquisition of this software in GSA could result in more than $100M in savings per year.\n- Agencies buy a wide range of common goods like band saw blades and televisions, which could be centralized in GSA and result in major savings for the American taxpayer.For a 32-7/8″ band saw blade, GSA’s average purchase price is 22% lower than that available through other government procurement vehicles and on the commercial market.\n\nFor a 50-inch flat screen TV, GSA’s average purchase price is 20% lower than that available through other government procurement vehicles, and almost 30% lower than commercial market pricing.\n- For a 32-7/8″ band saw blade, GSA’s average purchase price is 22% lower than that

government procurement vehicles, and almost 30% lower than commercial market pricing.\n- The federal government routinely handles sensitive information and buys identity protection services to prevent and respond to data breaches—however, these are purchased in a decentralized manner, leading to inconsistent pricing and underutilization of volume-based discounts.\n\nGSA has an established purchasing solution that channels government-wide demand and saved $150 million in FY 24 alone.\n- GSA has an established purchasing solution that channels government-wide demand and saved $150 million in FY 24 alone.\n- Every government agency needs to purchase computers for their employees to effectively serve the American people, totaling well over $1 billion annually.Over the last 10 years, almost $6 billion has gone through GSA, which realizes an average savings rate of 38%.\n\nWhile NASA, NIH, Army, and GSA have set up a program to establish minimum computer standards and leverage the volume of government purchasing to achieve savings, not every agency has taken advantage of the program to reduce their costs.\n- Over the last 10 years, almost $6 billion has gone

purchasing to achieve savings, not every agency has taken advantage of the program to reduce their costs.\n- Centralizing and standardizing procurement will make purchasing as simple and efficient as possible.\n- Using the aforementioned savings examples as a proxy, a 10% reduction in spending through this consolidation initiative could result in approximately $50 billion in savings to the taxpayers per year.\nELIMINATING WASTE: Since Day One, President Trump has been laser focused on eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government.\n- This Executive Order builds on his administration’s broader commitment to fiscal responsibility, cutting unnecessary bureaucratic bloat and redirecting resources to priorities that directly benefit the American people.\n- President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has already identified more than $100 billion in estimated savings from a “combination of asset sales, contract/lease cancellations and renegotiations, fraud and improper payment deletion, grant cancellations, interest savings, programmatic changes, regulatory savings, and workforce reductions.”"

ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  The United States possesses vast mineral resources that can create jobs, fuel prosperity, and significantly reduce our reliance on foreign nations.  Transportation, infrastructure, defense capabilities, and the next generation of technology rely upon a secure, predictable, and affordable supply of minerals.  The United States was once the world’s largest producer of lucrative minerals, but overbearing Federal regulation has eroded our Nation’s mineral production.  Our national and economic security are now acutely threatened by our reliance upon hostile foreign powers’ mineral production.  It is imperative for our national security that the United States take immediate action to facilitate domestic mineral production to the maximum possible extent.\nSec. 2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this order:\n(a)  “Mineral” means a critical mineral, as defined by 30 U.S.C. 1606(a)(3), as well as uranium, copper, potash, gold, and any other

and the production of processed critical minerals and other derivative products.\n(c)  The term “processed minerals” refers to minerals that have undergone the activities that occur after mineral ore is extracted from a mine up through its conversion into a metal, metal powder, or a master alloy.  These activities specifically occur beginning from the point at which ores are converted into oxide concentrates, separated into oxides, and converted into metals, metal powders, and master alloys.\n(d)  The term “derivative products” includes all goods that incorporate processed minerals as inputs.  These goods include semi-finished goods (such as semiconductor wafers, anodes, and cathodes) as well as final products (such as permanent magnets, motors, electric vehicles, batteries, smartphones, microprocessors, radar systems, wind turbines and their components, and advanced optical devices).\nSec. 3.  Priority Projects.  (a)  Within 10 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department and agency (agency) involved in the permitting of mineral production in the United States shall provide to the Chair of the NEDC a list of all mineral production projects for which a plan of operations, a permit application, or other application for approval has been submitted to such agency.  Within 10 days of the submission of such lists, the head of each such agency shall, in coordination with the Chair of the NEDC, identify priority projects that can be immediately approved or for which permits can be immediately issued, and take all necessary or appropriate actions within the agency’s authority to expedite and issue the relevant permits or approvals.\n(b)  Within 15 days of the date of this order, the Chair of the NEDC, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies, shall submit to the Executive Director of the Permitting Council mineral production projects to be considered as transparency projects on the Permitting Dashboard established under section 41003 of title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, Public Law 114-94, 129 Stat. 1748.  Within 15 days of receiving the submission, the Executive Director shall publish any projects selected and establish schedules for expedited review.\n(c)  The Chair of the NEDC, in consultation with relevant agencies, shall issue a request for information to solicit industry feedback on regulatory bottlenecks and other recommended strategies for expediting domestic mineral production.\nSec. 4.  Mining Act of 1872.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Chair of the NEDC and the Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs shall jointly prepare and submit recommendations to the President for the Congress to clarify the treatment of waste rock, tailings, and mine waste disposal under the Mining Act of 1872.\nSec. 5.  Land Use for Mineral Projects.  (a)  Within 10 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall identify and provide the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs with a list of all Federal lands known to hold mineral deposits and reserves.  The

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to enable parents, teachers, and communities to best ensure student success, it is hereby ordered:Section 1.  Purpose and Policy.  Our Nation’s bright future relies on empowered families, engaged communities, and excellent educational opportunities for every child.  Unfortunately, the experiment of controlling American education through Federal programs and dollars — and the unaccountable bureaucracy those programs and dollars support — has plainly failed our children, our teachers, and our families.Taxpayers spent around $200 billion at the Federal level on schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, on top of the more than $60 billion they spend annually on Federal school funding.  This money is largely distributed by one of the newest Cabinet agencies, the Department of Education, which has existed for less than one fifth of our Nation’s history.  The Congress created the Department of Education in 1979 at the urging of President Jimmy Carter, who received a first-ever Presidential endorsement from the country’s largest teachers’ union shortly after pledging to the union his support for a separate Department of Education.  Since then, the Department of Education has entrenched the education bureaucracy and sought to convince America that Federal control over education is beneficial.  While the Department of Education does not educate anyone, it maintains a public relations office that includes over 80 staffers at a cost of more than $10 million per year.Closing the Department of Education would provide children and their families the opportunity to escape a system that is failing them.  Today, American reading and math scores are near historical lows.  This year’s National Assessment of Educational Progress showed that 70 percent of 8th graders were below proficient in reading, and 72 percent were below proficient in math.  The Federal education bureaucracy is not working.  Closure of the Department of Education would drastically improve program implementation in higher education.  The Department of Education currently manages a student loan debt portfolio of more than $1.6 trillion.  This means the Federal student aid program is roughly the size of one of the Nation’s largest banks, Wells Fargo.  But although Wells Fargo has more than 200,000 employees, the Department of Education has fewer than 1,500 in its Office of Federal Student Aid.  The Department of Education is not a bank, and it must return bank functions to an entity equipped to serve America’s students.Ultimately, the Department of Education’s main functions can, and should, be returned to the States. Sec. 2.  Closing the Department of Education and Returning Authority to the States.  (a)  The Secretary of Education shall, to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.\n(b)  Consistent with the Department of Education’s authorities, the Secretary of Education shall ensure that the allocation of any Federal Department of Education funds is subject to rigorous compliance with Federal law and Administration policy, including the requirement that any program or activity receiving Federal assistance terminate illegal discrimination obscured under the label “diversity, equity, and inclusion” or similar terms and programs promoting gender ideology.Sec. 3.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nDONALD J.

Trump and his administration believe we can, and must, be better.\nInstead of maintaining the status quo that is failing American students, the Trump Administration’s bold plan will return education where it belongs — with individual states, which are best positioned to administer effective programs and services that benefit their own unique populations and needs.\nInstead of a bloated federal system that burdens schools with regulations and paperwork, the Trump Administration believes states should be empowered to expand educational freedom and opportunity for all families.\nWhy would we keep doing the same thing over and over again and expect a different result?"

Trump as he solidifies the U.S. as the global leader in artificial intelligence.\n“Having the support of an administration who cares about the success of this industry and not allowing energy to be an obstacle is a phenomenal result for AI in the U.S.,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\nHere’s what they’re saying:\n- Axios: “It’s another win for President Trump’s push to increase U.S. manufacturing, with a parade of corporations announcing American expansion.”\n- The Guardian: “Chipmaker’s promise is a sign that Trump’s ‘America First’ policy is affecting investment”\n- Financial Times: “The huge spending projection from the world’s most valuable semiconductor group follows multibillion-dollar US investment plans announced by other technology companies including Apple, as the impact of Trump’s ‘America First’ trade policies ripples through the global economy.”\n- Yahoo Finance: “…the latest company to consider plans to expand in the country as the Trump administration pushes forward with tariffs.”\nThat’s in addition to the trillions of dollars in new investments President Trump has already secured in tech-based manufacturing. In January, President Trump announced a $500 billion private investment in AI infrastructure led by OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank, while Apple announced a $500 billion investment and TSMC announced a $100 billion investment in chips manufacturing last month.\nIt goes well beyond tech as companies make plans to onshore their operations amid President Trump’s America First trade policy. This week, a Canadian furniture manufacturer opted to move its production to the U.S., while the biggest toymaker in the U.S. said it will move a “large percentage” of its China-based manufacturing back home.\nIn the auto sector, Stellantis announced a $5 billion investment in its U.S. manufacturing network as it pledges to build more vehicles domestically, Hyundai Motor is planning to “localize production in the U.S,” Nissan is considering moving production from Mexico to the U.S., and Honda is expected to produce its next-generation Civic hybrid model in Indiana.\nThe list of manufacturing wins is endless."

The meeting of the senior officials from both nations significantly helped in moving toward ending the war.\nPresident Zelenskyy thanked President Trump for the support of the United States, especially the Javelin missiles that President Trump was first to provide, and his efforts towards peace. The leaders agreed Ukraine and America will continue working together to bring about a real end to the war, and that lasting peace under President Trump’s leadership can be achieved.\nPresident Trump fully briefed President Zelenskyy on his conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the key issues discussed. They reviewed the situation in Kursk and agreed to share information closely between their defense staffs as the battlefield situation evolved.  President Zelenskyy asked for additional air defense systems to protect his civilians, particularly Patriot missile systems, President Trump agreed to work with him to find what was available particularly in Europe.\nThe two leaders also agreed on a partial ceasefire against energy. Technical teams will meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to discuss broadening the ceasefire to the Black Sea on the way to a full ceasefire. They agreed this could be the first step toward the full end of the war and ensuring security. President Zelenskyy was grateful for the President’s leadership in this effort and reiterated his willingness to adopt a full ceasefire.\nPresident Trump also discussed Ukraine’s electrical supply and nuclear power plants.  He said that the United States could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise.  American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.\nPresident Zelenskyy also thanked President Trump for continuing to push humanitarian concerns, including the exchange of POWs.  He noted they had just had a successful exchange and thanked the President for his leadership.  President Trump also asked President Zelenskyy about the children who had gone missing from Ukraine during the war, including the ones that had been abducted.  President Trump promised to work closely with both parties to help make sure those children were returned home.\nThey agreed all parties must continue the effort to make a ceasefire work. The Presidents noted the positive work of their advisors and representatives, especially Secretary Rubio, National Security Advisor Waltz, Special Envoy Kellogg, and others.  The Presidents instructed their teams to move ahead with the technical issues related to implementing and broadening the partial ceasefire. The Presidents instructed their advisors and representatives to carry out this work as quickly as possible. The Presidents emphasized that in further meetings, the teams can agree on all necessary aspects of advancing toward lasting peace and security.”"

Commonsense approaches and investments by State and local governments across American infrastructure will enhance national security and create a more resilient Nation. Federal policy must rightly recognize that preparedness is most effectively owned and managed at the State, local, and even individual levels, supported by a competent, accessible, and efficient Federal Government. Citizens are the immediate beneficiaries of sound local decisions and investments designed to address risks, including cyber attacks, wildfires, hurricanes, and space weather.

Policy. It is the policy of the United States that State and local governments and individuals play a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness, thereby saving American lives, securing American livelihoods, reducing taxpayer burdens through efficiency, and unleashing our collective prosperity.

Updating Federal Policy to Save Lives and End the Subsidization of Mismanagement. (a) National Resilience Strategy. Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), in coordination with the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and the heads of relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies), shall publish a National Resilience Strategy that articulates the priorities, means, and ways to advance the resilience of the Nation.

For purposes of this order, critical infrastructure policies do not include any policies related to purported “misinformation,” “disinformation,” or “malinformation,” nor so-called “cognitive infrastructure,” which should be reevaluated consistent with the policy set forth in Executive Order 14149 of January 20, 2025 (Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship), through a separate process. The policies to be reviewed and recommended for modification, as appropriate, include:\n(i) National Security Memorandum 16 of November 10, 2022 (Strengthening the Security and Resilience of United States Food and Agriculture);\n(ii) National Security Memorandum 22 of April 30, 2024 (Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience);\n(iii) Executive Order 14017 of February 24, 2021 (America’s Supply Chains); and\n(iv) Executive Order 14123 of June 14, 2024 (White House Council on Supply Chain Resilience).\n(c) National Continuity Policy.

The policies to be reviewed and recommended for modification, as appropriate, include:\n(i) Executive Order 12656 of November 18, 1988 (Assignment of Emergency Preparedness Responsibilities);\n(ii) Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 of February 28, 2003 (Management of Domestic Incidents);\n(iii) Presidential Policy Directive 8 of March 30, 2011 (National Preparedness);\n(iv) Presidential Policy Directive 22 of March 28, 2013 (National Special Security Events); and\n(v) Presidential Policy Directive 44 of November 7, 2016 (Enhancing Domestic Incident Response).\n(e) National Risk Register.

The Federal Government organizes national preparedness and continuity through the bureaucratic and complicated lens of overlapping and overbroad “functions,” which include: the National Essential Functions, Primary Mission Essential Functions, National Critical Functions, Emergency Support Functions, Recovery Support Functions, and Community Lifelines. Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall propose changes to the policies outlining this framework and any implementing documents to ensure State and local governments and individuals have improved communications with Federal officials and a better understanding of the Federal role. This proposal shall be coordinated through the process established by National Security Presidential Memorandum 1 of January 20, 2025 (Organization of the National Security Council and Subcommittees), or any successor processes, before being submitted to the President through the APNSA.\nSec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,March 18, 2025."

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 16, 2025, through March 22, 2025, to be National Poison Prevention Week.  I call upon all Americans to observe this week by taking actions to safeguard their families from poisonous products, chemicals, medicines, and drugs found in their homes, and to raise awareness about these dangers in order to prevent accidental injuries and deaths.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.\nDONALD J.

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 18, 2025, as National Agriculture Day.  I encourage all Americans to observe this day by recognizing the preeminent role that agriculture plays in our daily lives, acknowledging agriculture’s continuing importance to rural America and our country’s economy, and expressing our deep appreciation of farmers, growers, ranchers, producers, national forest system stewards, private agricultural stewards, and those who work in the agriculture sector across the Nation.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.\nDONALD J.

    "content": "The American steel industry will be “reinvigorated” by President Donald J. Trump’s tariffs on steel imports, writes Steel Manufacturers Association President Philip K. Bell in today’s Pittsburgh Post-Gazette — describing how President Trump’s action to close loopholes and exemptions will strengthen the critical industry.\n“The American steel industry, in other words, is going in reverse, primarily because of increasing imports from exempt countries and product exclusions. With global overcapacity soaring, foreign producers everywhere will take advantage of any gaps in America’s tariffs to find an outlet for their excess steel in the U.S. market.\nThe harmful impact of a ton of imported steel sold at the domestic industry’s expense does not depend on whether it comes from an ‘ally’ or ‘adversary’ country.\nA stable supply of domestically produced steel is more important than ever to America’s national, economic and energy security. In the face of the considerable pressure likely to come to exempt certain countries and weaken the tariffs, the president has stayed strong and continued to put America first on steel trade.”\nRead the full op-ed here."

    "content": "This weekend, the Trump Administration deported ruthless terrorist gang members — illegal immigrants who invaded our country and brought unspeakable devastation to our communities — as part of President Donald J. Trump’s utilization of every possible tool to protect the safety and security of the American people and reverse the damage done by years of feckless Democrat leadership. This bold, necessary action was immediately heralded by administration officials, members of Congress, and the American people: Vice President JD Vance: “There were violent criminals and rapists in our country. Democrats fought to keep them here. President Trump deported them.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio: “We have sent 2 dangerous top MS-13 leaders plus 21 of its most wanted back to face justice in El Salvador. Also, as promised by @POTUS, we sent over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars. President @nayibbukele is not only the strongest security leader in our region, he’s also a great friend of the U.S. Thank you!” Border Czar Tom Homan: “The Biden Administration released thousands of Venezuelan Tren de Aragua criminals into the US.  They have committed armed robberies, sex trafficked young girls, attacked US citizens, assaulted our police and raped and murdered young women and children. But now, thanks to the American people, we have President Trump!  Last night, 238 Tren de Aragua members along with 21 MS13 gang members, were deported from this country adding to the thousands of criminal aliens already deported. Under President Trump’s leadership, this country is becoming safer every day.  With each criminal illegal alien being deported, neighborhoods are becoming safer.   Criminal illegal aliens, gang members and national security threats can try to hide with the help of sanctuary cities, however, know this, ICE will not stop until they are found and deported. This important work, that ICE is doing will continue while Attorney General Pam Bondi takes the sanctuary jurisdictions to court.  We have much more to do AND IT WILL BE DONE!!!” Sen. John Barrasso: “Deporting violent criminals, rapists, terrorists, and drug dealers who came to America illegally is commonsense. Thank you President Trump for making America safer.” Sen. Tom Cotton: “President Trump campaigned and won on making Americans safer. The deportation of depraved Tren de Aragua savages is the first step towards repairing our country after years of open border policies.” Sen. Chuck Grassley: “Another day, another judge unilaterally deciding policy for the whole country. This time to benefit foreign gang members If the Supreme Court or Congress doesn’t fix, we’re headed towards a constitutional crisis. Senate Judiciary Cmte taking action” Sen. Mike Lee: “Do you miss the foreign terrorists now that Trump has deported them? I don’t” Sen. Markwayne Mullin: “You’d think everyone would believe this, but we’re facing another 80/20 issue… I 100% support the Trump admin’s effort to deport violent illegal aliens from the United States of America. This includes Venezuelan gang members.” Sen. Eric Schmitt: “While you slept, your government sent three planes full of Tren de Aragua and MS-13 thugs to the beautiful prisons of El Salvador. Thanks to the leadership of this administration—and our friend @nayibbukele—America is safer today than it was yesterday.” Rep. Brian Babin: “Judge Boasberg is endangering Americans! He blocked the deportation of violent Tren de Aragua gang members—rapists, murderers, and thugs. No judge should have the power to override @POTUS’ national security decisions.” Rep. Lauren Boebert: “Democrats in Colorado called the threat of Tren De Aragua a ‘figment of imagination.’ Thank you @POTUS and President @NayibBukele for doing what’s necessary to keep Americans safe!” Rep. Andrew Clyde: “Let me get this straight… Joe Biden could blatantly violate our immigration laws to flood our country with criminal illegal aliens—but President Trump can’t deport them?” Rep. Mike Collins: “It’s ridiculous that a Democratic president can import violent gang members, but a Republican president can’t deport them.” Rep. Eli Crane: “The activist judges were suspiciously quiet when Joe Biden enacted all the policies that led to gang members ENTERING America. How’s that work? Only vocal when President Trump DEPORTS them?” Rep. Byron Donalds: “These are criminal aliens to our nation. These are gang members, murderers, and rapists. Under President Trump, they are rightly being arrested and deported, but the left wants them to stay. We are Making America Safe Again” Rep. Lance Gooden: “Democrats gave illegal criminals luxury hotels. President Trump gave illegal gang members a one-way ticket to the world’s most feared prison. Thank you, President @nayibbukele and El Salvador!” Rep. Wesley Hunt: “It is incredible to see Democrats defend Tren De Aragua and MS-13 members. Tom Homan says these flights will continue. The Trump administration will NOT stop until every last criminal alien is out of this country!” Rep. Darrell Issa: “The day @realDonaldTrump returned to the White House, America started sending criminal illegals out of our country.” Rep. Nick Langworthy: “Radical Left Democrats put our country in danger every single day and made every state a border state. That ended the day President Trump took his oath. He is cleaning up our country and making America safe again.” Rep. Nicole Malliotakis: “Thank you to President Trump & El Salvador President Bukele for getting these dangerous gang members removed from the United States. Shame on ACLU for working to shield these foreign gangs who have wreaked havoc & committed heinous crimes in our country from deportation.” Rep. Addison McDowell: “Yesterday, an Obama-appointed judge ruled that two flights carrying rapists and murderers from the Tren de Aragua gang be turned around & brought back to the U.S. This is flat out disgusting and I’m glad @realdonaldtrump is moving full steam ahead.” Rep. Mary Miller: “The government’s first duty is to protect its people. President Trump stands in sharp contrast to the Biden regime and the entire Democrat Clan—they’ve completely failed America. Now, they’re watching what real leadership looks like. This is how it’s done” Rep. Ralph Norman: “These are gang leaders, rapists, and murderers who thought they could find refuge in America. NOT ANYMORE!!” Rep. Scott Perry: “Why did an activist judge try to stop the deportation of illegal, criminal migrants – hardcore rapists, gang members, and cartel / drug traffickers – who not only broke laws in their own country before invading our Nation, but came here to break ours as well?” Rep. Chip Roy: “Judge Boasberg should be on a plane to Houston to sit with Alexis Nungaray & explain why we must keep TDA gang members who killed her daughter. Radical progressive Dems endangered us by fueling an invasion of our communities. Trump is right to take quick action to reverse it.” Rep. María Elvira Salazar: “BRAVO @nayibbukele and President Trump! Bukele is an expert at LOCKING UP every gang member, murderer and criminal. It’s great to see us working with our allies in the hemisphere again to get the thugs out of the USA.” Rep. Keith Self: “Incredible. All we needed was a new President.” Rep. Greg Steube: “Thank you, President Trump and President Bukele, for taking a zero-tolerance approach to criminal illegal immigrants and terrorists. The Trump administration secured a deal with El Salvador to extradite and imprison Tren de Aragua gang members who exploited Biden’s open-border disaster. No country should tolerate terrorists and criminals roaming free. This is how you lead with strength.” Rep. Marlin Stutzman: “Cartel members who engaged in kidnapping, sexual abuse of children, robbery, and aggravated assault on a police officers belong in prison. Anyone standing in the way of their deportation and jailing is no friend of our country. Glad these criminals are off of our streets.” Rep. Tom Tiffany: “First, Democrats allowed Tren de Aragua members into our country. Now, a rogue judge and Democrats are fighting to keep them here. Why are they protecting illegal gang members instead of U.S. citizens?” Rep. Derrick Van Orden: “I am not sure Americans understand how amazingly terrible this rogue judge’s ruling was. He wanted to keep violent criminal illegal aliens, including rapist, in the United States. @realDonaldTrump & @JDVance are protecting Americans.” Rep. Randy Weber: “The only words Democrats should be saying right now are: ‘Thank you, President Trump, for taking action to get terrorists out of our country.’ These are dangerous thugs who despise everything America stands for. God bless President Trump.” Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares: “Radicals want you to believe Trump is acting illegally by deporting Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang. These aren’t U.S. citizens—they’re violent criminals who exploited Biden’s border failures to terrorize Americans. I’ll always fight for the rule of law.” America First Legal: “President Trump has deported 238 criminals in the violent Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador to be imprisoned in CECOT, the country’s maximum-security prison. Tren de Aragua is a real and present danger, and President Trump’s decisive action will protect Americans.” Retired CIA Senior Operations Officer Rick de la Torre: “President Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to expel Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang members from U.S. soil is not only the right move—it’s a long-overdue strike against a growing national security threat.” Attorney Mike Davis: “Amen. For 4 years, Democrats pretended grandmas trespassing into the Capitol were a graver threat than foreign terrorists invading America. Robbers, rapists, and murderers. President Trump is fulfilling his constitutional duty, as commander-in-chief, to repel foreign invasion.” Commentator Joe Pagliarulo: “The Trump Administration is sending back violent gang members … Everybody in the United States, no matter which side you are on politically, should agree that they should go back.” Discovery Institute Senior Journalism Fellow Jonathan Choe: “This is what awaits violent criminal illegals in America. Look at this recent batch of Tren De Aragua gang members deported to an El Salvadoran prison.” The Conservative Caucus’s Jim Pfaff: “Trump took action. While a judge blocked the deportation of Tren de Aragua criminals to Venezuela, Nayib Bukele agreed to take them into his Salvadoran prisons which are much worse for them than anything they faced In Venezuela.”"

    "content": "This morning, the Trump Administration took to the TV networks to make clear to the country and world that American strength is back – and no longer will terrorist attacks on U.S. troops and vital international commerce be tolerated.\nHere’s what you missed:President Trump on Full Measure\n- On securing the border: “You just needed a new president … I said, ‘close the border’ — and they closed the border.”\n- On tariffs: “We have companies moving into the United States at levels that has never been seen before.”\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio on Face the Nation\n- On Houthi terrorist attacks in the Red Sea: “In the last 18 months, the Houthis have struck or attacked … the U.S. Navy 174 times, and 145 times, they’ve attacked commercial shipping. So, we basically have a band of pirates with guided precision anti-ship weaponry exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. That’s just not sustainable.”\n- On revoking visas for terrorist sympathizers: “When you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you are a guest … If you tell us when you apply for a visa, ‘I’m coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events,’ that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States … If you had told us you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa.”\n- On tariffs: “I understand why these countries don’t like it — because the status quo of trade is good for them. It benefits them … We are going to set a new status quo … We have de-industrialized the United States of America. There are things we can no longer make.”\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Sunday Morning Futures\n- On U.S. strikes against Houthi terrorists: “An era of peace through strength is back … This campaign is about freedom of navigation and restoring deterrence … The minute the Houthis say ‘we’ll stop shooting at your ships, we’ll stop shooting at your drones,’ this campaign will end. But until then, it will be unrelenting.”\n- On President Trump’s agenda: “Shipbuilding, long-range munitions, hypersonics, long-range drones, a Golden Dome, southern border – the president has laid out very clearly his agenda to rebuild the U.S. military … We have revived the warrior ethos.”\nNational Security Advisor Mike Waltz on This Week\n- On U.S. strikes against Houthi terrorists: “These were not pinprick, back and forth, what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks. This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.”\nNational Security Advisor Mike Waltz on Fox News Sunday\n- On negotiations for peace in Ukraine: “As both President Putin and Zelensky said on our first call just a few weeks ago, only President Trump could drive this to an end … We know who we’re dealing with on all sides.”\nSecretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Meet the Press\n- On President Trump’s economic agenda: “One week does not the market make… It would have been very easy for us to come in, run these reckless policies that have been happening before. We’ve got these large government deficits… We are bringing those down in a responsible way.”\n- On tariffs: “Chinese manufacturers will eat the price … I believe that the currency adjusts … If we’re de-regulating, if we’re getting energy prices down, then if we look across the spectrum, Americans will realize lower prices and better affordability.”\nSpecial Envoy Steve Witkoff on State of the Union\n- On negotiations to end the war in Ukraine: “Before this visit, there was another visit, and before that visit, the two sides were miles apart … The two sides are, today, a lot closer … We’ve narrowed the differences.”\n- On when a deal to end the war could be possible: “The president uses the timeframe weeks — and I don’t disagree with him. I am really hopeful that we’re going to see some real progress here.”\n- On dealing with Hamas: “What happened with the Houthis yesterday, what happened with our strike, ought to inform as to where we stand with the regard to terrorism and our tolerance level for terrorist actions — and I would encourage Hamas to get much more sensible.”\nPress Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Sunday Morning Futures\n- On securing our homeland: “The president signed a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act against Tren de Aragua members who have invaded our country … The president invoked this authority to deport nearly 300 of them who are now in El Salvador, where they will be behind bars where they belong.”\n- On activist legal challenges: “President Trump is not shy of resistance … Clearly, there are left-wing activists who sit behind a bench in a courthouse who don’t like this president and his policies, but the fact is everything President Trump is doing is within his executive authority.”"

They rape, maim and murder for sport. TDA is responsible for some of the most heinous crimes that have occurred on US soil in recent years, including the murders of Laken Riley and Jocelyn Nungaray.\nTDA is a direct threat to the national security of the United States.\nThis weekend, at the President’s direction, the Department of Homeland Security successfully arrested nearly 300 Tren de Aragua terrorists, saving countless American lives. Thanks to the great work of the Department of State, these heinous monsters were extracted and removed to El Salvador where they will no longer be able to pose any threat to the American People.\nPresident Trump will always put the safety of the American People first — and he will never allow foreign terrorist enemies to operate on American soil and endanger our people.

    "slug": "presidential-message-on-the-birthday-of-president-andrew-jackson-2025",
    "content": "Today, we celebrate the birthday of our seventh Commander-in-Chief, Andrew Jackson, “the People’s President.”\nThroughout his life, Andrew Jackson was a steadfast patriot.  Raised on the battlefield of the Revolutionary War, he was just 13 years old when he left home with his two older brothers to fight for Independence.  At 14, he was the only surviving member of his immediate family.  During the War of 1812, he went on to lead a ragtag militia to a resounding victory over the British in the epic Battle of New Orleans.  As a fierce defender of democracy and a warrior for the people, he ran for President in 1828, shocking the establishment class when he won the popular vote in a landslide.\nTo return power to the people, President Jackson cut ten percent of the Federal workforce and fearlessly combatted forces of corruption in our Nation’s Capital.  He imposed tariffs on foreign nations to safeguard American workers and pay off our national debt.  Through it all, he defied relentless slanders and smears—including the infamous “corrupt bargain” of the 1824 election—in defense of our Country.\nMy Administration is proudly upholding the vision of President Jackson’s historic movement by reining in unwieldy government spending, advancing a strong manufacturing base, and restoring a Government that answers to the American People.  Every day, we are dismantling bloated bureaucracy, cutting wasteful programs, slashing excess regulations, bringing back fair trade, restoring our manufacturing base, and ensuring that not a single American tax dollar goes to waste.\nPresident Jackson is an American icon, a military hero, and a gallant guardian of democracy.  As we commemorate his 258th birthday, we commit to furthering his legacy, expanding his vision, honoring his memory, and restoring the full might of American democracy for many years to come.  Today, I am once again proud to hang his portrait in the Oval Office of the People’s House.\nAs our Nation prepares to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence next year, President Jackson’s birthday is a particularly meaningful opportunity to remember the heroes who embody the best of the American Spirit—and whose legacy continues to inspire us and lead our Nation to a future of greatness.\nHappy birthday, President Jackson!"

    "date": "2025-03-15",
    "slug": "president-trump-is-standing-up-to-terrorism-and-protecting-international-commerce",
    "content": "It has been over a year since a U.S.-flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.Our economic and national security have been under attack by the Houthis for too long. Today, President Trump’s action and leadership are moving to end this.\nShipping Disruption\n- Houthi attacks against shipping since 2023 have caused a sustained negative effect on global trade and the economic security of the United States. A 2024 Defense Intelligence Agency report detailed how container shipping through the Red Sea has precipitously declined due to Houthi attacks.\n- Before their attacks, 25,000 merchant ships passed through the Red Sea annually. The current number has dropped to around 10,000 ships annually.\n- Imports of consumer goods and cars to the United States, as well as agricultural exports from our own Gulf of America, have been rerouted due to the Houthi attacks.\n- In November 2023, the Houthis seized the ship M/V Galaxy Leader and began to attack commercial ships with anti-ship missiles and unmanned vehicles.\n- Houthi attacks caused approximately 75% of U.S.- and UK-affiliated vessels to reroute around Africa instead of transiting the Red Sea. Traveling around Africa takes an average of ten days longer than sailing through the Red Sea. Additional fuel costs are roughly one million dollars more for each voyage around Africa.\n- Higher shipping rates caused by Houthi attacks probably increased global consumer goods inflation between 0.6 and 0.7 percent in 2024.\nImpacts to Allies and Partners\n- The Red Sea serves a primary conduit for trade between Europe and Asia. Around 95% of ships traveling between Europe and Asia normally would go through the Red Sea.\n- Out of the top ten importers (by value) of trade through the Red Sea, five are EU nations.\n- Houthi attacks caused approximately 60% of EU-affiliated vessels to reroute around Africa instead of transiting the Red Sea\nThe Houthis have attacked U.S. warships 174 times and commercial vessels 145 times since 2023.2023\n- October 19, 2023: The USS Carney, a U.S. Navy destroyer, intercepted multiple missiles launched from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen. These missiles posed a threat to U.S. forces.\n- November 19, 2023: The Houthis attacked and seized the M/V Galaxy Leader and held the multinational crew hostage for over a year.\n- December 3, 2023: Houthi forces launched missiles and drones targeting three commercial ships in the Red Sea. The USS Carney responded to distress calls and intercepted three drones during this assault.\n- December 16, 2023: The USS Carney engaged and destroyed 14 drones launched by the Houthis in the southern Red Sea, preventing potential attacks on U.S. military and commercial maritime vessels.\n- December 26, 2023: The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and USS Gravely responded to a distress call from the commercial vessel Maersk Hangzhou, which was under attack by Houthi forces. U.S. Navy helicopters engaged, resulting in the sinking of three Houthi boats.\n- December 30, 2023: Houthi forces fired anti-ship ballistic missiles targeting the USS Gravely. The destroyer successfully intercepted the incoming missiles, preventing any damage.\n2024\n- January 10, 2024: The Houthis launched a large-scale missile and drone attack against U.S. and UK naval forces in the Red Sea. The coordinated defense successfully neutralized all incoming threats.\n- January 15, 2024: The Houthis rebels targeted the U.S.-owned M/V Gibraltar Eagle with a missile, resulting in damage to the vessel.\n- January 17, 2024: The Houthi rebels targeted the U.S.-owned cargo ship Genco Picardy in the Gulf of Aden using drones, resulting in damage to the vessel.\n- January 26, 2024: The oil tanker Marlin Luanda, linked to British interests, was attacked by Houthi missiles in the Gulf of Aden, causing a fire onboard.\n- August 21, 2024: The Houthi rebels attack the Greek-flagged oil tanker M/V Sounion, threatening a massive oil-spill and followed by a months-long salvage effort.\n- September 27, 2024: The USS Spruance, USS Stockdale, and USS Indianapolis were targeted by a barrage of missiles and drones launched by Houthi forces in the Red Sea. All threats were intercepted without any damage to the U.S. warships.\n- November 11, 2024: Houthi forces launched a coordinated attack involving drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles against the USS Spruance and USS Stockdale in the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. The U.S. destroyers successfully intercepted all incoming threats.\n- December 1, 2024: While escorting U.S.-flagged merchant vessels in the Gulf of Aden, the USS Stockdale and USS O’Kane intercepted multiple missiles and drones launched by Houthi forces, ensuring the safety of the convoy.\n- December 9–10, 2024: The USS Stockdale and USS O’Kane again faced Houthi-launched drones and missiles while escorting merchant vessels in the Gulf of Aden. All threats were neutralized without any damage."

    "content": "BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\nA PROCLAMATION\nTren de Aragua (TdA) is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization with thousands of members, many of whom have unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States. TdA operates in conjunction with Cártel de los Soles, the Nicolas Maduro regime-sponsored, narco-terrorism enterprise based in Venezuela, and commits brutal crimes, including murders, kidnappings, extortions, and human, drug, and weapons trafficking. TdA has engaged in and continues to engage in mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States citizens, undermining public safety, and supporting the Maduro regime’s goal of destabilizing democratic nations in the Americas, including the United States.\nTdA is closely aligned with, and indeed has infiltrated, the Maduro regime, including its military and law enforcement apparatus. TdA grew significantly while Tareck El Aissami served as governor of Aragua between 2012 and 2017. In 2017, El Aissami was appointed as Vice President of Venezuela. Soon thereafter, the United States Department of the Treasury designated El Aissami as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, 21 U.S.C. 1901 et seq. El Aissami is currently a United States fugitive facing charges arising from his violations of United States sanctions triggered by his Department of the Treasury designation.\nLike El Aissami, Nicolas Maduro, who claims to act as Venezuela’s President and asserts control over the security forces and other authorities in Venezuela, also maintains close ties to regime-sponsored narco-terrorists. Maduro leads the regime-sponsored enterprise Cártel de los Soles, which coordinates with and relies on TdA and other organizations to carry out its objective of using illegal narcotics as a weapon to “flood” the United States. In 2020, Maduro and other regime members were charged with narcoterrorism and other crimes in connection with this plot against America.\nOver the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA. The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States. Indeed, in December 2024, INTERPOL Washington confirmed: “Tren de Aragua has emerged as a significant threat to the United States as it infiltrates migration flows from Venezuela.” Evidence irrefutably demonstrates that TdA has invaded the United States and continues to invade, attempt to invade, and threaten to invade the country; perpetrated irregular warfare within the country; and used drug trafficking as a weapon against our citizens.\nBased upon a review of TdA’s activities, and in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury, on February 20, 2025, acting pursuant to the authority in 8 U.S.C. 1189, the Secretary of State designated TdA as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\nAs President of the United States and Commander in Chief, it is my solemn duty to protect the American people from the devastating effects of this invasion. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. 21 et seq., hereby proclaim and direct as follows:\nSection 1. I find and declare that TdA is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States. TdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela. I make these findings using the full extent of my authority to conduct the Nation’s foreign affairs under the Constitution. Based on these findings, and by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 50 U.S.C. 21, I proclaim that all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA, are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. I further find and declare that all such members of TdA are, by virtue of their membership in that organization, chargeable with actual hostility against the United States and are therefore ineligible for the benefits of 50 U.S.C. 22. I further find and declare that all such members of TdA are a danger to the public peace or safety of the United States.\nSec. 2. I direct the Attorney General, within 60 days of the date of this proclamation, to prepare and publish a letter under her signature declaring the policy described in section 1 of this proclamation as the policy of the United States and attaching this proclamation. I direct the Attorney General to transmit this letter to the Chief Justice of the United States, the chief judge of every circuit court of appeals, the chief judge of every district and territorial court of the United States, each Governor of a State and territory of the United States, and the highest-ranking judicial officer of each State and territory of the United States.\nSec. 3. I direct that all Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation are subject to immediate apprehension, detention, and removal, and further that they shall not be permitted residence in the United States.\nSec. 4. Pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law, apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove every Alien Enemy described in section 1 of this proclamation. The Secretary of Homeland Security retains discretion to apprehend and remove any Alien Enemy under any separate authority.\nSec. 5. All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall collaborate with law enforcement officials of the United States and with appropriate State, local, and tribal officials, to use all lawful means to apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation.\nSec. 6. Pursuant to my authority under 50 U.S.C. 21 to direct the conduct to be observed on the part of the United States toward the Alien Enemies subject to this proclamation, to direct the manner and degree of the restraint to which such Alien Enemies shall be subject and in what cases, to provide for the removal of such Alien Enemies, and to establish any other regulations which are found necessary “in the premises and for the public safety,” I hereby direct the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to execute all the regulations hereinafter contained regarding the Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security are further directed to cause the apprehension, detention, and removal of all members of TdA who otherwise qualify as Alien Enemies under section 1 of this proclamation. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security are authorized to take all necessary actions under the Alien Enemies Act to effectuate this proclamation, consistent with applicable law. In doing so, and for such purpose, they are authorized to utilize agents, agencies, and officers of the United States Government and of the several States, territories, dependencies, and municipalities thereof and of the District of Columbia. All such agents, agencies, and officers are hereby granted full authority for all acts done by them in the execution of such regulations when acting by direction of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as the case may be.\nPursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. 21 et seq., I hereby declare and establish the following regulations which I find necessary “in the premises and for the public safety”:\n(a) No Alien Enemy described in section 1 of this proclamation shall enter, attempt to enter, or be found within any territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Any such Alien Enemy who enters, attempts to enter, or is found within such territory shall be immediately apprehended and detained until removed from the United States. All such Alien Enemies, wherever found within any territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, are subject to summary apprehension.\n(b) Alien Enemies apprehended pursuant to this proclamation shall be subject to detention until removed from the United States in such place of detention as may be directed by the officers responsible for the execution of these regulations.\n(c) Alien Enemies shall be subject to removal to any such location as may be directed by the officers responsible for the execution of these regulations consistent with applicable law.\n(d) All property in the possession of, or traceable to, an Alien Enemy, which is used, intended to be used, or is commonly used to perpetrate the hostile activity and irregular warfare of TdA, along with evidence of such hostile activity and irregular warfare, shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture.\nThe Attorney General is further granted authority, pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act and 3 U.S.C. 301, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, to issue any guidance necessary to effectuate the prompt apprehension, detention, and removal of all Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation. Any such guidance shall be effective immediately upon issuance by the Attorney General.\nThis proclamation and the directives and regulations prescribed herein shall extend and apply to all land and water, continental or insular, in any way within the jurisdiction of the United States.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand thisfourteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.\n"

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Background.  Global law firms have for years played an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles.  Many have engaged in activities that make our communities less safe, increase burdens on local businesses, limit constitutional freedoms, and degrade the quality of American elections.  Additionally, they have sometimes done so on behalf of clients, pro bono, or ostensibly “for the public good” — potentially depriving those who cannot otherwise afford the benefit of top legal talent the access to justice deserved by all.  My Administration will no longer support taxpayer funds sponsoring such harm.  My Administration has already taken action to address some of the significant risks and egregious conduct associated with law firms, and I have determined that similar action is necessary to end Government sponsorship of harmful activity by an additional law firm:  Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (Paul Weiss).  In 2021, a Paul Weiss partner and former leading prosecutor in the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller brought a pro bono suit against individuals alleged to have participated in the events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, on behalf of the District of Columbia Attorney General.In 2022, Paul Weiss hired unethical attorney Mark Pomerantz, who had previously left Paul Weiss to join the Manhattan District Attorney’s office solely to manufacture a prosecution against me and who, according to his co-workers, unethically led witnesses in ways designed to implicate me.  After being unable to convince even Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg that a fraud case was feasible, Pomerantz engaged in a media campaign to gin up support for this unwarranted prosecution.Additionally, Paul Weiss discriminates against its own employees on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws.  Paul Weiss, along with nearly every other large, influential, or industry leading law firm, makes decisions around “targets” based on race and sex.  My Administration is committed to ending such unlawful discrimination perpetrated in the name of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process.  Those who engage in blatant discrimination and other activities inconsistent with the interests of the United States should not have access to our Nation’s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds.\nSec. 2.  Security Clearance Review.  (a)  The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Paul Weiss and Mark Pomerantz, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.(b)  The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Paul Weiss.  The heads of all agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision.\nSec. 3.  Contracting.  (a)  To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Paul Weiss and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract.(b)  The heads of all agencies shall review all contracts with Paul Weiss or with entities that disclose doing business with Paul Weiss under subsection (a) of this section.  To the extent permitted by law, the heads of agencies shall:(i)   take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, for which Paul Weiss has been hired to perform any service;(ii)  otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, all agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with Paul Weiss or with entities that do business with Paul Weiss effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order.\nSec. 4.  Racial Discrimination.  Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the action authorized by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP).\nSec. 5.  Personnel.  (a)  The heads of all agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Paul Weiss when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States.  In addition, the heads of all agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Paul Weiss employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States.     (b)  Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of Paul Weiss, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States.\nSec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.                               DONALD J.

into focus as Americans saw needed economic relief following years of Bidenflation.\n\nConsumer inflation “eased more than expected” in February, with core inflation at its lowest level in nearly four years — driven by a decline in airfare prices as Americans prepare for Spring Break.\n\n\n\nWholesale inflation came in much lower than expected in February.\n\n\n\nMortgage rates dropped to their lowest levels since December, while home purchase applications are at their highest level since January.\n\n\n\nThe price of a dozen eggs is down 36.6% since President Trump’s inauguration.\n\n\n\nThe

news that illegal crossings have plummeted to the lowest levels ever recorded.\n\nIn President Trump’s first 50 days, ICE arrested 32,809 illegal immigrants — nearly 75% of whom were accused or convicted criminals — virtually the same number of arrests over the entirety of Biden’s final year in office.\n\n\n\nJust 77 “gotaways” were recorded in the past three weeks — a 95% decrease from the average daily number of “gotaways” under Biden in 2023.\n\n\n\nMigration to the U.S. through Panama’s Darien Gap has dropped by 99% as would-be illegal border crossers turn around.\n- In President

playing field for American workers.\n\nSteel Manufacturers Association: “As the revised steel tariff goes into effect today, President Trump is boldly declaring that America will no longer be a dumping ground for cheap, subsidized foreign steel … By closing loopholes in the tariff that have been exploited for years, President Trump will again supercharge a steel industry that stands ready to rebuild America.”\n\n\n\nFive major organizations representing the steel industry issued a statement lauding the tariffs.\n- Steel Manufacturers Association: “As the revised steel tariff goes into

    "content": "Oval Office\n12:33 P.M. EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Hello, everybody.  It’s great to be with a friend of mine, who was prime minister of the Netherlands, so I got to know him very well.  We had a great relationship always.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Absolutely.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Mark Rutte.  Now he’s secretary general of NATO and doing a fantastic job.  Everybody — every report I’ve gotten is what a great job he did.  And I’m not at all surprised when I hear it.  We had to support him, and we supported him as soon as I heard the name.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  But he was a fantastic prime minister, and he’s doing a fantastic job. An even tougher job.  Which is tougher: being the prime minister of Netherlands or?\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  This job is quite tough.  Yeah.  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I would think this is a little tougher.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  But — but Dutch politics is also brutal.  So — (laughter).\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.  But this is pretty tough.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  But you’re doing good.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’re going to be discussing a lot of things.  Obviously, we’ll be discussing what’s happening with respect to Ukraine and Russia.\nAt this moment, we have people talking in Russia.  We have representatives over there — Steve Witkoff and others.  And they’re in very serious discussions.  As you know, Ukraine has agreed, subject to this — what’s happening today — to a complete ceasefire, and we hope Russia will do the same.\nThousands of people are being killed — young people, usually, mostly young people.  We were just talking about it.  Thousands of young people are being killed a week, and we want to see that stop.  And they’re not Americans, and they’re not from the Netherlands for the most part.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  No.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  They’re not from — they’re from Russia and they’re from Ukraine, but they’re people.  And I think everybody feels the same way.  We want it to stop.\nIt’s also a tremendous cost to the United States and to other countries.  And it’s something that would have never happened if I were president, and it makes me very angry to see that it did happen.  But it happened, and we have to stop it.\nAnd Mark has done some really good work over the last week.  We’ve been working together, and he’s done some really good work.  So, I’m very happy about that.\nWe’ll also be talking about trade and various other things, and I think we’ll have a very, very strong day.  We’re going to have lunch afterwards.  That’ll go.  And then we’ll see you all later.\nBut, Mark, would you like to say something?\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.  First of all, thank you so much, Mr. President, dear Donald, again for hosting me and — but also for taking time in Florida a couple of weeks after you —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.  That’s right.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — you were reelected.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s right.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  And, of course, our phone call a couple of weeks ago.  And I must say, Trump 45 — you basically — you originated the fact that in Europe we are now spending, when you take it to aggregate, $700 billion more on defense —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — than when you came in office in 2016 — in 2017.\nBut that was Trump 45.  But when look at Trump 47 —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Going to be hard to top.  (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — what happened the last couple of weeks is really staggering.  The Europeans committing to a package of $800 billion defense spending.  The Germans now —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — potentially up to half a trillion extra in defense spending.  And then, of course, you have Keir Starmer here, the British prime minister, and others all committing to much higher defense spending.\nThey’re not there.  We need to do more.  But I really want to work together with you in a run-up to The Hague summit to make sure that we will have a NATO which is really reinvigorated under your leadership.  And we are getting there.\nWe also discussed defense production, because we need to produce more weaponry.  We are not doing enough — not in the U.S., not in Europe.  And we are lagging behind when you compare to the Russians and the Chinese.  And you have a huge defense industrial base, Europeans buying mo- — four times more here than the other — the other way around, which is good, because you have a strong defense industry.\nBut we need to do more there to make sure that we ramp up production and kill the red tape.  So, I would love to work with you on that.\nAnd finally, Ukraine — you broke the deadlock.  As you said, all the killing, the young people dying, cities getting destroyed.  The fact that you did that, that you started the dialogue with the Russians and the successful talks in Saudi Arabia now with the Ukrainians — I really want to commend you for this.\nSo, well, The Hague is my hometown.  I’d love to host you there in the summer and work together to make sure that —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’ll do that.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — that will be a splash, a real success, projecting American power on the world stage.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  What Mark is saying is: When I first went to NATO, my first meeting, I noticed that very few people were paying.  And if they were, they weren’t paying their fair share.  There were only seven countries that were paying what they were supposed to be paying, which was —\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  It’s even worse, there were three.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  That’s even worse.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  It could be even worse.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  But there were just very few countries that were paying.  And even the paying, it was at 2 percent, which is too low.  It should be higher.  It should be quite a bit higher.\nBut you had Poland and I remember Poland was actually paying a little bit more than they were supposed to, which I was very impressed with.  And they’ve been actually terrific and some of the others.  But most of them weren’t paying or they were paying very little.\nAnd I didn’t think it was appropriate to bring it up there, but I said, “It’s going to be brought up at my next meeting.”  And my next meeting — you know, the first meeting, you want to give them a little break.  The second meeting, it began.\nAnd I was able to raise —\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  You did.  (Laughs.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  — hundreds of billions of dollars.  I just said, “We’re not going to be involved with you if you’re not going to pay.”  And the money started pouring in.  And NATO became much stronger because of my actions and working along with a lot of people, including Mark.\nBut they would not pay for other presidents.  I don’t think other presidents even knew that they weren’t paid.  I asked, first question, “Has everybody paid up?”  And literally, I mean, they showed — they told me seven.  You could be right.  It could be three.  But — that makes it even worse — but they just weren’t paying.\nAnd I said, “No, I won’t protect if you’re not paying.  If you’re delinquent or if the money isn’t paid, why would we do that?”\nAnd as soon as I said that, got a little hit from the press, because they said, “Oh, gee, that’s not very nice.”  But if you said the other, nobody would have paid.  And the money started coming in by the billions.\nAnd, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars flowed into NATO, and NATO became strong.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And you remember that.  And your predecessor, who I thought was a very good man actually.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Absolutely.  Jens Stoltenberg.  He sends his best greetings.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.  He was terrific.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Stoltenberg, secretary general.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Great man.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And he made the statement that when Trump came in, the money started coming in like we never saw before.  Hundreds of billions — it was actually probably close to $600 billion came in.  And NATO became strong from that standpoint.\nAnd now, we have to use it wisely.  And we have to get this war over with.  And you’ll be back to a normal — much more normal life.\nAnd maybe we’re close.  We’re getting words that things are going okay in Russia, and it doesn’t mean anything until we hear what the final outcome is.\nBut they have very serious discussions going on right now with President Putin and others.  And hopefully, they all want to end this nightmare.  It’s a nightmare.  It’s a horrible thing, when you look.  I get pictures every week.  They give me the pictures of the battlefield, which I almost don’t want to see.  It’s so horrible to see.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  It’s so terrible.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Young people laying — arms and legs and heads laying all over the field.  It’s the most terrible thing that you’ll ever see.\nAnd it’s got to stop.  These are young people with mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers and friends, and it’s got to stop.\nSo, we hopefully are going to be in a good position sometime today to have a good idea.  We’ll have — we know where we are with Ukraine, and we are getting good signals outside of Russia as to where we are with Russia, and hopefully they’ll do the right thing.\nIt’s a really — humanity — we’re talking about humanity.  We’re not talking about the money.  But then you add the money to it, and, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars is being spent and, really, wasted so unnecessarily.  It should have never happened.\nSo, it’s an honor to have you here.  They picked a great gentleman.  I’ll tell you, that was — I was so happy to hear, because you had somebody — Stoltenberg was really good.  And you have somebody that’s going to do an incredible job.  And I was so much in favor of you, you have no idea.\nThey had another person that I did not like.  (Laughter.)  I was not happy.  And I think I kept him from — you know what I’m talking about.  I said, “This is the right man to do it.”  And he really did.  He was a great prime minister of the Netherlands.  He did a great job.  And that’s what he’s doing right now.\nSo, thank you, everybody, for being here.  And very great honor to have you.  And we even have some of our great energy people here today, right?  We have the governor, and we have Chris.  You know Chris.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.  Absolutely.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  He’s supposed to be the most talented man in the world of energy, according to the governor.  (Laughter.)  So, I don’t know if he’s right.\nAnd we have — General, you’ve been fantastic.  Thank you very much.\nAnd we have a lot of good people that won’t be so much involved with this, but they wanted to see what was happening.  It’s become a little bit of a show — (laughter) — but they wanted to see what was happening.  And I think a lot of good things are happening.\nSo, with that, if anybody would have a question.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Mr. President, o- — on Russia.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Please, go ahead.\nQ    Vlad- —     Q    Sorry.  Sorry, Mary.  Steve Witkoff’s trip to Moscow, you spoke about it.  What sort of agreement do you hope he comes away from there with?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we’d like to see a ceasefire from Russia.  And we have, you know, not been working in the dark.  We’ve been discussing with Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost and all of the other elements of a final agreement.\nThere’s a power plant involved — you know, a very big power plant involved.  Who’s going to get the power plant and who’s going to get this and that.  And so, you know, it’s not an easy process.\nBut phase one is the ceasefire.  A lot of the individual subjects have been discussed, though.  You know, we’ve been discussing concepts of land, because you don’t want to waste time with the ceasefire if it’s not going to mean anything.  So, we’re saying, “Look, this is what you can get.  This is what you can’t get.”\nThey discussed NATO and being in NATO, and everybody knows what the answer to that is.  They’ve known that answer for 40 years, in all fairness.\nSo, a lot of the details of a final agreement have actually been discussed.  Now we’re going to see whether or not Russia is there, and if they’re not, it’ll be a very disappointing moment for the world.\nYeah.\nQ    And Vladimir Putin just said he is open to a ceasefire, but he does still have some concerns.  He suggested that you two should speak directly.  Do you have plans to speak to him soon?  If so, when?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I would.  Yeah, sure.\nQ    And are you confident you can get this across the finish line?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Sure.  He did say that today.  It was a very promising statement, because other people are saying different things, and you don’t know if they have anything to really — if they have any meaning, or I don’t know.  I think some of them were making statements.  I don’t think they have anything to do with it.\nNo, he put out a very promising statement, but it wasn’t complete.  And, yeah, I’d love to meet with him or talk to him, but we have to get it over with fast.  You know, every day people are being killed.  It’s not like — as we sit here, two people will be killed.  Think of it.  Two people are going to be killed during this little period of time.      Thousands of people a week are dying, so we really don’t have very much time.  We have to make this fast.  It shouldn’t be very complicated.\n(Cross-talk.)\nYes.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.  A representative of Canada, the finance minister, are in town and will meet members of your administration during the day.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Sure.  Yeah.\nQ    Any chances that you will ban on the tariffs on aluminum and — and the — the ones that are planned for April 2nd?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  No.\nQ    You are not going to change your mind?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, I’m not.  Look, we’ve been ripped off for years, and we’re not going to be ripped off anymore.  No, I’m not going to bend at all on aluminum or steel or cars.  We’re not going to bend.  We’ve been ripped off as a country for many, many years.  We’ve been subjected to costs that we shouldn’t be subjected to.\nIn the case of Canada, we’re spending $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada.  I love Canada.  I love the people of Canada. I have many friends in Canada.  “The Great One,” Wayne Gretzky, the great.  Hey, how good is Wayne Gretzky?  He’s the Great One.\nBut we have — I know many people from Canada that are good friends of mine.  But, you know, the United States can’t subsidize a country for $200 billion a year.  We don’t need their cars.  We don’t need their energy.  We don’t need their lumber.  We don’t need anything that they give.\nWe do it because we want to be helpful, but it comes a point when you just can’t do that.  You have to run your own country.  And to be honest with you, Canada only works as a state.  We don’t need anything they have.  As a state, it would be one of the great states anywhere.\nThis would be the most incredible country visually.  If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it — between Canada and the U.S.  Just a straight artificial line.  Somebody did it a long time ago — many, many decades ago — and makes no sense.\nIt’s so perfect as a great and cherished state, keeping “O Canada,” the national anthem.  I love it.  I think it’s great.  Keep it, but it’ll be for the state.  One of our greatest states.  Maybe our greatest state.\nBut why should we subsidize another country for $200 billion?  It costs us $200 billion a year.  And again, we don’t need their lumber.  We don’t need their energy.  We have more than they do.  We don’t need anything.  We don’t need their cars.  I’d much rather make the cars here.\nAnd there’s not a thing that we need.  Now, there’ll be a little disruption, but it won’t be very long.  But they need us.  We really don’t need them.  And we have to do this.  I’m sorry, we have to do this.\nYes.\nQ    Mr. President —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.\nQ    — you have made it very clear that NATO needs to step up, although great progress —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.\nQ    — has been made in your first mandate.  How do you envision this new transatlantic —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Are you talking about NATO stepping up?\nQ    Yes.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, NATO is stepping up through this man. This man is a man that only knows how to step up.  And we have the same goal in mind: We want the war ended.  And he’s doing his job.  He only knows how to do a good job.  That’s one thing.  That’s why I fought for him to get that job —\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Thank you so much.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  — because they had some other candidates that I’ll tell you would not have done a very good job.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  I need this part of the — of the movie for my family.  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s right.  That’s right.  We’ll get you a clip.      SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.  Exactly.  (Laughs.)     PRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’re going to get him a clip of that — of that little last essay.  But the rest of the statements he doesn’t care about.\nQ    Sir, how does this new transatlantic cooperation — how do you envision it?  What is it going to look like?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we have — that’s one thing.  I mean, you know, we’re the other side of the ocean, and they’re right there.  And yet, we’re in for $350 billion because of Biden, and they’re in for $100 billion.  So, it’s a big difference, and it’s unfair.\nAnd I said, “You have to equalize.”  They should equalize.  They should have — it should have never happened, where Biden just gave his money away.\nNow, as you know, we have an agreement with Ukraine on the rare earths and other things, and that’ll get us\nsomething back — a lot back.  It’ll get us our money back.  We’re not doing it for that, though.  We’re doing — I’m just doing this to get the war stopped.  I’m doing it, really, to save lives.\nBut, at the same time, we were treated very unfairly, as we always are by every country.  And we’re in for very substantially more than the European nations are in for, and that shouldn’t be.\nYou know, they’re much more affected by it than we are, because we do have an ocean in between.\nBut I don’t know.  I think good things are going to happen.  I really do.  I think good things are going to happen.\nI do say — we were talking before, and Mark was very nice.  He said, “If you wouldn’t get involved, there would be” — you’d just be going on.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  This thing would have gone on for a long time.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Breaking a deadlock.  It was crucial.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, we broke a deadlock.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  We did break a deadlock.  I hope it’s meaningful.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, did you have one?\nQ    Mr. President —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, please.\nQ    Yes, sir.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Amanda Head with Just the News.  On the southern border, you’ve got DHS and ICE, who are reporting that there was a little bit of fudging of numbers during the Biden administration —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.\nQ    — on both the catch and the release side with respect to reporting the number of illegals coming into the country who were released.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  They cheated on the numbers.  They were — the numbers were — I love that question.\nQ    Right.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Who are you with?\nQ    Just the News.  Amanda Head.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Very nice.  That’s good.  That’s good.\nQ    Do you know how many of those are criminal illegal aliens?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Many of them.\nQ    And Biden is out of office —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:   Yeah.\nQ    — Alejandro Mayorkas.  Who gets held accountable?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, Biden fudged the numbers.  The numbers were totally fake, and he gave fake numbers.  I knew they were fake.  Everybody knew they were fake, but now it came out.  And terrible what — what they did.  That administration was a horror show for this country.\nQ    Can you hold anyone accountable?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I don’t know.  They gave phony numbers, and phony numbers are a very bad thing to give.  But I’m not sure about that.  I don’t know how it would play.  We want to get it straightened out.\nWe have — we’re after many, many bad people that were let into our country.  And Kristi Noem and my friend Homan — how good is Tom Homan doing, right?  And they’re after them.  And they — I mean, you see: They’re taking them out in record numbers.  Gang members, gang leaders, drug dealers.\nThis is a problem the Netherlands does not have.  The Netherlands never had this problem.  If you’d like to take —\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  We have a few drug- — drug dealers, I’m afraid.  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I could deliver some people.  I could deliver some nice people to the Netherlands if you’d like.  (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  I’m not sure.  (Laughs.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, what he did to this country, letting 21 million people flow through an open border — many of those people were hard criminals from prisons and jails, from mental institutions, and I always say “insane asylums,” because they were seriously deranged.  And they’re here from not South America, from all over the world.  From South America, but from all over the world.  And it’s so sad.\nYou’d say, “Why would anybody do this?  Why?”\nYeah, go ahead.\nQ    And — and one more.  There’s some new internal Democrat polling that doesn’t look great for Democrats, but it also has 54 percent unfavorability for Republicans in swing states and battlegrounds for the midterms.  Do you consider those voters cap- — capturable for — for Republicans?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, well, we did — you know, I won every swing state, as you know, by a lot, and I won the popular vote by a lot, and we won the counties.  If you look at the counties and district plan, we had 2,725, and they had 501.  That’s a real — that’s why the map is all red.  So, we had a great thing.\nYeah, I think winning from the Democrats — I saw — if you looked the other night, I made a speech, and I introduced two young ladies who were killed.  Two killed.  Viciously, violently killed.  Young.  Unbelievable.  Both outstanding people.  They were killed by illegal aliens.  And the Democrats wouldn’t get up and applaud.  The mothers were, I mean, inconsolable.  They were crying, and everybody was crying.  The Democrats sat there with stone faces.  They didn’t clap, they didn’t stand, they didn’t do anything.\nWe had a young man with very serious cancer, wanted to — his dream is to be with the police department someday, and he was introduced.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  That was very touching.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  They didn’t even clap.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah, I saw it.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I mean, they were disgusting.  Frankly, they were disgusting.  There’s something wrong with them.  They’re deranged.  They’re deranged.  Like Jack Smith, they’re deranged people.\nAnd I never saw anything like it.  I’m standing up, and I introduce the mother and the parents of these two young girls that were just recently, essentially, killed.  Violently killed.  And the Democrats are like this.  It’s so sad.\nAnd I saw this morning where — one of them is pretty well-known — one is arguing, fighting like crazy over men being able to play in women’s sports.  I said, “Yeah, I thought that was tried.”  I thought that was about a 95 — I think it’s a 95 percent issue.\nBut, in a way, I want them to keep doing it, because I don’t think they can win a race.  I mean — and I tell the Republicans, I said, “Don’t bring that subject up, because there’s no election right now.  But about a week before the election, bring it up, because you can’t lose.”\nAnd everything is “transgender this, transgender that.”  You know, they have bad politics.\nBut one thing: They stick together.  You know?\nI wish — and the Republicans stick together, mostly, but we have a couple that are grandstanders.  You know, you always have grandstanders in life.\nBut the Democrats, they don’t seem — they have grandstanders, but when it comes to a vote, they do stick together, right?\nVICE PRESIDENT VANCE:  They get in line.  Yes, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  So.\nQ    It seems like they’ll stick together on the shutdown.  Will that hurt Democrats going into midterms?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, if they do a shutdown and, ultimately, that might lead to very, very high taxes, because we’re talking about a shutdown.  We’re talking about getting to work immediately on the greatest tax bill ever passed.  That was the one we did.  It’s a renewal, and it’s an addition to it.  And we’re going to cut people’s taxes.\nAnd if we don’t open, the Democrats are stopping all of these good things that we’re providing.  We’re providing the greatest package of benefits that this country has ever provided.\nThe biggest part of that’s going to be tax cuts for the middle class and for businesses, small businesses, employers — people that hire people and jobs.\nAnd if it’s shut down, it’s only going to be — if there’s a shutdown, it’s only because of the Democrats, and they would really be taking away a lot from our country and from the people of our country.\nQ    Mr. President, on — on tariffs.  You made clear you’re not backing down from this, but many American small-business owners say they are concerned that these tariffs are going to hurt them.  What’s your message to them?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  They’re going to be so much richer than they are right now.\nAnd we have many — yesterday, General Motors was in.  They want to invest $60 billion.  The people from Facebook were in yesterday.  They’re going to invest $60 billion by the end of the year.  Other people are talking about numbers.\nApple, as you know, a few days ago, announced $500 billion investment.  They’re going to build their plants in the United States, which, as you know, almost all of their plants are in China.  Now they’re building in the United States.\nLook, the reason is two things.  Number one, the election. November 5th.  And the other thing is tariffs.  I think, probably, in that order.\nBut Tim Cook came in and he announced 500 — think of it, $500 billion, not million.  Five hundred million is a lot, when you think about it, right?  But —\nVICE PRESIDENT VANCE:  Yes, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I would have been happy with $500 million.  But it’s $500 billion investment by Apple in the United States, and that’s because of the election result and it’s because of the tariffs and the tax incentives too.  You know, tariffs and tax incentives.  And I’ve never seen anything like it.\nWe have plants going up now in Indiana.  We have plants going up in Michigan.  A lot of plants going to be planned from — I’m trying to steer them to Michigan, because Michigan got so badly beaten by, you know, what happened with Europe.\nYou know, if you look at Europe. Take a look at the EU.  We’re not allowed to sell cars there.  It’s prohibitive because of their policies, and also their nonmonetary tariffs.  They put obstacles in your way that you can do nothing about.\nBut if you take a look at what happens — so, we sell no cars to Europe — I mean, virtually no cars — and they sell millions of cars to us.  They don’t take our agriculture.  We take their agriculture. It’s like a one-way street with them.\nThe European Union is very, very nasty.\nThey sue our companies.  Apple was forced to pay $16 billion on a case that — very much like my cases that I won.  They shouldn’t have been even cases.  But we felt they had no case, and they ended up having an extremely favorable judge and decision.\nBut they’re suing Google, they’re suing Facebook, they’re suing all of these companies, and they’re taking billions of dollars out of American companies, many more than the ones I just mentioned.  And I guess they’re using it to run Europe or something.  I don’t know what they’re using it for.\nBut they treat us very badly.  China obviously treats this very badly.  Almost everybody does.  And I blame past presidents, to be honest.\nBecause when I was president, I — we received, so far, about $700 billion from China, over the years, on the tariffs that I put in.  No other president got 10 cents from China.  And that was only beginning.  Except for COVID, it would have — I would have been able to finish the process.  But we had to fight the COVID thing, and we did really well with it.  But we had to fight.\nAnd then we had actually — as you remember, Mark, we actually handed over the stock market.  It was higher than just previous to COVID coming in, which was sort of a miracle, frankly.  We did a good job.\nBut the tariffs are very important.  And I think the psychology — there’s great spirit.  When Mark came in, he said, “Congratulations.  There’s a whole new spirit.  There’s a whole new light over this country, and really over the world” —\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  — because you have somebody that — a whole group of people, really, because I talk about this whole group, that we know what we’re doing.  And a lot of great things are happening.\nBut I’ve never seen investment like this.  Trillions of dollars is being invested in the United States now that would have never — our country could have failed.  Another four years of this, what happened in the last four years, our country would have been a crime-ridden mess.\nAnd I don’t know if you noticed — a little thing, they call it, but it’s not a little thing if you don’t have — if you like eggs and you don’t have a lot of money — eggs have gone down 25 percent in the last couple of weeks.  We inherited that problem: eggs.\nGroceries have gone down a little bit.  Energy has gone down.\nDo you want to speak to that for a second, Governor?  Would you just say a couple of words, you and Chris, about energy, what’s happened?\nSECRETARY BURGUM:  Well, happy to, but I think that — Chris and I just came from CERAWeek, which is the largest conference in the world.  So, global leaders, people from the EU, officials from all the energy-producing countries all there.  And all the global nationals, all the U.S.  The — the spirit of that group is through the roof, because now they realize that in the United States, that President Trump’s policies are pro — pro developing more energy, as opposed to we’re trying to shut down energy.\nAnd that pro-growth, pro-business, pro- — pro-energy approach is giving people the optimism.  So, then the markets are reacting to that, and energy prices on the futures market are going to go down because people know we’re — we’re not going to be killing off the energy we need for prosperity in all of our countries, but also for peace, because people have used energy to fuel these wars that President Trump is working so hard to end.  And — and we — we know that energy — high energy prices were driving the inflation that he talked about.\nSo, it accomplishes two goals for us — which is prosperity for the world, peace for the world — when we have smart energy policies.  And — and President Trump has brought common sense back to how we think about energy.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And it’s brought down now $65 a barrel,  I saw this morning.  That’s phenomenal news, and that’s going to bring — that’s what brought it up.  The energy went — they took our beautiful energy policies and they just messed them up.  And then they went immediately back to them, because — but by that time, they lost it.  They lost that bronco, as the expression goes.\nChris, do you have something to say?\nSECRETARY WRIGHT:  I think Doug said it well, but you just can’t overstate how important the return of common sense, the return of knowledge about energy and pro-American consumers, pro investment in our country.  I think, globally, that was welcomed.  It means capital flows.  It means more sobriety and lower energy prices, more economic opportunity for Americans.\nSo, yeah, it was elated atmosphere at a global energy conference.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we’re working on one project, and it should be very easy.  It’s a pipeline going through a small section of New York.  New York has held it up for years, actually.  For years they’ve wanted to do it. For years and years.  And it will reduce —\nThe most expensive energy, almost, in the world is in New England, because they have no way of getting it there because it’s been held up by New York.  And the whole of New England and Connecticut and New York — the energy prices are through the roof.  And this one pipeline will save per family, $2,500 just on heating and another $2,500 on everything else.  So, the energy — by just a simple pipeline going through an area that wants it — an area that’s not a rich area; it’s actually a very poor area — would create jobs and everything else.\nAnd it’s going to be way underground.  Nobody’s going to see it.  Once they fill it up, nobody’s going to see it.  Nobody’s going to know it’s there.\nAnd families in New York and Connecticut and New England are going to save $5,000 a family.  Think of that.  Because, right now, they have the highest energy prices maybe in the world, they say.  New England is a disaster.\nSo, we’re working on that.  In fact, the governor is coming in — governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, who’s a very nice woman.  She’s coming in tomorrow morning at 9 o’clock to meet me on that and other things — not only that, but other things.\nSo, I hope we don’t have to use the extraordinary powers of the federal government to get it done, but if we have to, we will.  But I don’t think we’ll have to.\nI can tell you, Connecticut wants it and all of New England wants it.  And who wouldn’t want it?  And it’s also jobs on top of everything else.  So, that’s going to be very exciting.  So, we’re meeting with the governor tomorrow morning.\n(Cross-talk.)\nYeah.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.  Greenland.  What is your vision for the potential annexation of Greenland and getting them, potentially, to —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.\nQ    — to statehood?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think it’ll happen.  And I’m just thinking — I didn’t give it much thought before, but I’m sitting with a man that could be very instrumental.  You know, Mark, we need that for international security — not just security, international.  We have a lot of our favorite players, you know, cruising around the coast, and we have to be careful.  And we’ll be talking to you.\nAnd it’s a very appropriate — really, a very appropriate question.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  It’s an —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — an issue in the high north, so the Arctic.  So, what you did —\nSo, when it comes to Greenland, yes or no, joining the U.S., I would leave that outside, for me, this discussion, because I don’t want to drag NATO in that.\nBut when it comes to the high north in the Arctic, you are totally right.  The Chinese and — are using these routes.  We know that the Russians already arming.  We know we have a lack of icebreakers.  So, the fact that the seven — outside of Russia, there are seven Arctic countries — working together on this, under U.S. leadership — it’s very important to make sure that that region, that that a part of the world stays safe.  And — and we know things are changing there, and we have to be there.\nQ    Well, they just had an election there the other day.  I mean, do you see a referendum, a plebiscite where the people of Greenland would be in a position to decide if they want to become part of the United States?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, it was a good election for us, as you know.  It was not a referendum.  It wouldn’t be called that.  It was an individual election.  But the person that did the best is a very good person, as far as we’re concerned.  And so, we’ll be talking about it.  And it’s very important.\nMark mentioned the word “icebreaker.”  So, we’re in the process of ordering 48 icebreakers, and Canada wants to know if they could use them.  I said, “Well, you know, you got to pay for them.”  Think of it.  Canada.  We pay for their military.  You know, Canada pays very little for their military, because they think we’re going to protect them, but — even with the icebreakers.\nSo, we’re going to order 48, and Canada wants to be part of the deal.  I say, “You got to get your own icebreakers.  I mean, if you’re a state, you can be part of the deal, but if you’re a separate country, you’ve got to get your own icebreakers.”\nRussia, as you know, has about 40 of them, and we have 1 big icebreaker.  But that whole area is becoming very important and for a lot of reasons.  The routes are, you know, very direct to Asia, to Russia, and you have ships all over the place.  And we have to have protection.  So, we’re going to have to make a deal on that.\nAnd Denmark is not able to do that.  You know, Denmark is very far away and really has nothing to do.\nWhat happens?  A boat landed there 200 years ago or something, and they say they have rights to it.  I don’t know if that’s true.  I’m not — I don’t think it is, actually.\nBut we’ve been dealing with Denmark.  We’ve been dealing with Greenland.  And we have to do it.  We really need it for national security.  I think that’s why NATO might have to get involved in a way, because we really need Greenland for national security.  It’s very important.\nYou know, we have a couple of bases on Greenland already, and we have quite a few soldiers that — maybe you’ll see more and more soldiers go there.  I don’t know.\nWhat do you think about that, Pete? Don’t answer that, Pete.  (Laughter.)  Don’t answer that question.\nBut we have bases, and we have quite a few soldiers on Greenland already.\nQ    Mr. President, some people question your commitment to NATO.  Will everything — anything change?\nYour com- — your commitment to NATO, will anything change?  Same amount of money?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think they made —\nQ    Same number of troops?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  — a great step by putting Mark in charge.  I think, to me, that’s a great step, because he and I have seen eye to eye on everything for a long time.  We’ve been doing this a long time now.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Nine years now.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And so, that’s a great step.\nYou have to keep NATO strong.  You have to keep it relevant.\nBut the biggest thing we have to worry about right now is what’s going on right now.  I think the rest is going to take care of itself.\nI don’t see this having — this was a fluke.  This was something that if we had a competent president, it would not have happened.  The man was grossly incompetent.  All you have to do is look in — take a look at — he signs by autopen.\nWho was signing all this stuff by autopen?  Who would think you signed important documents by autopen?  You know, these are major documents you’re signing.  You’re proud to sign them.  You have your signature on something — in 300 years, they say, “Oh, look.”  Can you imagine?  Everything was signed by autopen — almost everything.  Nobody has ever heard of such a thing.\nQ    Do you —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  So —\nQ    Sorry.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Should have never happened.\nQ    You’re speaking tomorrow at the Justice Department about law and order.  Could you tell us a little bit about that?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, we’re going to be with the Justice Department.  We have a great Justice Department.  Pam Bondi is so fantastic.  And Todd Blanche and Emil — you got to know him a little bit; he was acting for a little while — and some other people are incredible in the Justice Department.\nAnd I consider the FBI to be a part of it, in a sense, and Kash is going to be fantastic, and all the people he’s — Dan Bongino, I love that.  I mean, I love that.  I think Dan is great.\nI think we have unbelievable people.  And all I’m going to do is set out my vision.  It’s going to be their vision, really, but it’s my ideas.  And basically, we don’t want to have crime in the streets.  We don’t want to have people pushed into subways and killed, and then the — the person that did the pushing ends up in a 15-year trial and gets off scot-free.  We want to have justice, and we want to have safety in our cities, as well as our communities.\nAnd we’ll be talking about immigration.  We’ll be talking about a lot of things.  Just the complete gamut.  So, I look forward to that.  That will be tomorrow at the Justice Department.\nQ    Mr. President, you are a man of peace.  You’ve said it several times and made it very clear.  A man of peace dealing with belligerent people.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.\nQ    And I’m thinking we saw you handled Zelenskyy in this very own room.  What is your leverage on Putin?  Are you thinking sanctions?  What if he refuses to —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I do have leverage, but I don’t want to talk about leverage now, because right now we’re talking to him.  And based on the statements he made today, they were pretty positive, I think, so I don’t want to talk about that.\nI hope Russia is going to make the deal too.  And I think once that deal happens, you’re never going to be in a process.  I don’t think they’re going back to shooting again.  I really believe if we get a peace treaty, a ceasefire treaty, I think that leads to peace.  That’s going to really lead to a —\nI don’t think anyone wants to go back.  They’ve been doing this for a long time, and it’s vicious and violent.  And I think if President Putin agrees and does a ceasefire, I think we’re going to be in very good shape to get it done.  We want to get it over with.  That’s why — it was very important what I instructed everybody, including Steve, what we’re looking for: to discuss concepts of land, concepts of —\nMR. WALTZ:  Yes, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  — of power plants because it’s complicated.  You know, you have a whole — you’re sort of creating the edge of a country.\nThe sad part is that country, if they didn’t — if this didn’t happen — and it wouldn’t have happened — I don’t know if they would have to give anything back.  I guess Crimea?\nYou know, I said it last time, Crimea was given by Obama, Biden gave them the whole thing, and Bush gave them Georgia.  And Trump didn’t give them anything.\nI gave them — you know what I gave them?  I gave them Javelins.  And the Javelins were very effective, as you know.  I gave them nothing —\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  2019.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And then also, if you take a look, I was the one that stopped the pipeline going into Europe.  It was totally stopped: Nord Stream 2.  Nobody ever heard of Nord Stream 2 before I came along.\nBut I got along very well with President Putin.  I got along with most of them.  I get along great with President Xi.  I got along great with Kim Jong Un.  I got along great with all of them.  And we had no wars.  We had no problems.  We wiped out ISIS in record time. General “Razin” Kane.  And he wiped them out.\nAnd he is going to be our new chief, right?  He’s going to be —\nSECRETARY HEGSETH:  Yes, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  — the head of Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he’s a highly respected man.  He’s going to be great.\nPete is going to be fantastic.  I have no doubt about it.  We have a great team.  A really great team.\nYeah, please.  Go ahead, please.\nQ    Mr. President, some of our allies have said that they’re worried that they could be the next to be attacked by Russia.  You’ve spoken directly with the Russian president.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.\nQ    Do you think those fears are justified?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, I don’t.  I think when this gets done, it’s done.  They’re going to all want to go home and rest.  I don’t see it happening.  Nope, I don’t see that happening.  And we’ll make sure it doesn’t happen.  Not going to happen.  But we’ll make sure it doesn’t happen.\nYeah, go ahead, please.\nQ    Leaders from Russia and Iran are heading to Beijing tomorrow to discuss nuclear programs.  What do you hope to get out of that?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, maybe they’re going to talk about non-nuclear programs.  Maybe they’re going to be talking about the de-escalation of nuclear weapons, because, you know, I was talking about that with President Putin very strongly.  And we could have done something.  Had that election not been rigged, we would have had something.  I think I would have made a deal with Putin on de-escalation, denuclearization, as they say.  But we would have de-escalated nuclear weapons, because the power of nuclear weapons is so great and so devastating.\nAnd, right now, Russia and us have by far the most, but China will catch us within five years.  China doesn’t have — but they’re in the process of building.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: And they build.  And within four or five years, they’ll probably have the same.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  And, by the way, you — this is a Republican tradition.  Ronald Reagan, when he negotiated with Gorbachev —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — in the 1980s —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s right.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — about bringing down the number of nuclear weapons is what you have been doing your first term.  And it is important.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  It would be a great achievement if we could bring down the number.  We have so many weapons, and the power is so great.\nAnd we — number one, you don’t need them to that extent.  And then we’d have to get others, because, as you know, in a smaller way — Kim Jong Un has a lot of nuclear weapons, by the way — a lot — and others do also.  You have India.  You have Pakistan.  You have others that have them, and we’d get them involved.\nBut we started off with Russia and us.  We have, by far — actually, by far, the most.  And we were going to denuclearize, and that was going to happen.\nAnd then we were going to China.  And I spoke to China.  I spoke to President Xi about it.  And he really liked the idea.  You know, he’d like not to spend trillions of dollars building weapons that, hopefully, he’s never going to have to use.  And — because they are very expensive also.  So, that would have been great.\nOkay, one or two more.\n(Cross-talk.)\nYeah, go ahead.\nQ    Thank you.  We are looking at an impending government shutdown Friday at midnight.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.\nQ    Democrats, for 30 years straight, have said, if there’s a shutdown, bad things happen.  Do you anticipate direct negotiations yourself with conference leader of the Democrats, Chuck Schumer?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, if they need me, I’m there a hundred percent.  It’s — right now, it’s two or three people.  If it shuts down, it’s not the Republicans’ fault.  You know, we passed a bill where we had an incredible Republican vote.  We only had one negative vote, a grandstander.  You know, one grandstander.  There’s always a grandstander in the lot.      But it was amazing.  People were amazed that the Republicans were able to vote in unison like that so strongly.      If there’s a shutdown, even the Democrats admit it will be their fault.  And I’m hearing a lot of Democrats are going to vote for it, and I hope they do.  This is an extension.\nBut ultimately, we want to vote for one big, beautiful bill where we put the taxes in, we put everything in.  We’re going to have big tax cuts.  We’re going to have tremendous incentives for companies coming into our country and employing lots of people.       It’ll be — I called it, in a rare moment, one big, beautiful bill.  That’s what I like.  And it seems to be that’s where they’re heading.  And we’ll have to take care of something to do with Los Angeles.      A place called Los Angeles almost burned to the ground.  By the way, I broke into Los Angeles.  Can you believe it?  I had to break in.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I invaded Los Angeles.  And we opened up the water, and the water is now flowing down.  They have so much water, they don’t know what to do.  They were sending it out to the Pacific for environmental reasons.  Okay?  Can you believe it?  And in the meantime, they lost 25,000 houses.  They lost — and nobody’s ever seen anything like it.      But we have the water.  I’d love to show you a picture.  You’ve seen the picture.  The water is flowing through the half pipes.  You know, we have the big half pipes that go down.  Used to — 25 years ago, they used to have plenty of water, but they turned it off for — again, for environmental reasons.  Well, I turned it on for environmental reasons and also fire reasons.\nAnd I’ve been asking them to do that during my first term.  I said, “Do it.”  I didn’t think anything like — could happen like this, but they didn’t have enough water.      Now the farmers are going to have water for their land, and the water is in there.\nBut I actually had to break in.  We broke in to do it because we had people that were afraid to give water.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  They were — in particular, they were trying to protect a certain little fish.  And I say, “How do you protect a fish if you don’t have water?”  They didn’t have any water, so they’re protecting a fish, and that didn’t work out too well, by the way.       So, they have a lot of water going down throughout California, all coming out from the Pacific Northwest, even some from Canada.\nThank you, Canada, very much.  I appreciate it.      Next thing you know, they’ll want to turn the water off.  They’ll want to charge us for the water.     But it comes up from the Pacific Northwest, and it’s a beautiful thing to see.  I mean, it is brimming with water.      Now, if they would have had that done, you wouldn’t have had the damage, because the fire would have been put out.  The fire hydrants would have been loaded.  The sprinklers in people’s living rooms and bedrooms would have been loaded up with the — they had no water.  The government makes them put sprinklers in.  They had no water in the sprinklers because they had no water.      So, the water is flowing, and we’re going to have to give a lot of money to Los Angeles to help them, and the Democrats are going to want to do that.  So, that’s the one thing different.      And I frankly, I think that makes it a lot easier.  But one of the big thing is we have the big, beautiful bill.  We got to get that done.  And that will put our country in a position like it’s never been in.      It’s a reduction of taxes.  It’s tremendous incentives for companies to come from all over the world into our country.  It’s great environmentally, but it’s not this environmental scam that we went through — that we all went through.  It provides for everything.\nIt’s a big, beautiful bill, and I hope we can get it approved.  And that will be next.      But in the meantime, we have the continuing resolution, and the Republicans have approved it, and now the Democrats have to approve it.  And I hope they will.      And I think a lot of them — I can tell you, they want to.  I’ve spoken to some of them.  They really want to.  Their leadership may not want them to.  And if it closes, it’s purely on the Democrats.      All right, one more.     Q    On Korea, sir.  We’ve seen tension increasing in the Peninsula.  You’ve talked about Kim Jong Un.  Do you have any plans of getting — of reestablishing the relationship you had during the first meeting?     PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.  Well, I would.  I had a great relationship with Kim Jong Un, North Korea.  If I wasn’t elected, if Hillary got in, you would have had a nuclear war with North Korea.  He expected it.  He expected it.  And they said, “Oh, thousands of people.”  No, millions of people would have been killed.       But I got in.  We went to Singapore.  We met.  We went to — to Vietnam.  We met.  We got along really good.  We had a very good relationship.  And we still do.  We still do.  You don’t have that threat that you had.\nQ    You have talked with — have you talked to him?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I mean, look, when I was running the first time, it looked like there was going to be a war with North Korea.  You know that better than anyone.     SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Tensions were high.  Yes.  Yeah.     PRESIDENT TRUMP.  Yeah.  And it started off —     SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  And everybody was — was startled that you —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — invited him for talks.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.\nSECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  But you did, and it —     PRESIDENT TRUMP:  It started out very rough.       SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.  Yeah.     PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And he wouldn’t meet with Obama.  Wouldn’t take his calls.  I said, “How many times did you call?” They called a lot.  He wouldn’t take their call.  He told me, “I wouldn’t take his call.”      But with me, it did start off rough, if you remember.  Very rough, actually.  Very nasty.  And —      SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  That was in Singapore, the first one?     PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, but then — no, before that.  Then it stopped.  The rhetoric was extremely tough.  It was a little bit —     SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  You had it in your speech at the U.N. I remember.  (Laughs.)     PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, that’s right.  It was a little bit dangerous.\nAnd then we met.  They asked for a meeting, and then we met.  And the meeting caused the Olympics, which was in South Korea, to become a tremendous success.  Nobody was buying tickets for the Olympics because they didn’t want to be nuked.       And I met, and not only did the Olympics become successful, but North Korea participated in the Olympics.     SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.  His sister visited.     PRESIDENT TRUMP:  It was an amazing thing.     SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.     PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And that was something that was an achievement of the Trump administration. Great achievement.  And so, I have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un.  And we’ll see what happens.      But certainly, he’s a nuclear power.     Okay?  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.                                  END            1:20 P.M.

Core consumer prices, which is the best measure of inflation, dropped to its lowest level in FOUR years. This inflation report, much like last week’s jobs report, is far better than the media predicted and the so-called ‘experts’ expected. When will they learn to stop doubting President Trump? As he successfully did in his first term, President Trump is driving down costs through massive deregulation and energy dominance. The entire Trump Administration will continue to focus on fixing the economic and inflation nightmare created by the Biden-Harris Administration to unlock the Golden Age of America.”  — Karoline Leavitt, White House Press Secretary\nToday’s Consumer Price Index showed inflation “eased more than expected” in February as Americans finally see some welcome relief following years of unending Bidenflation — with core inflation at its lowest level in nearly four years and mortgage rates dropping to their lowest levels since December.\nAnd the wins don’t stop there. President Trump’s commitment to deregulation and leveling the playing field for American workers continues to attract unprecedented investment in manufacturing and job creation:\n- GE Aerospace announced it will invest $1 billion in its U.S.-based manufacturing operation across 16 states — creating 5,000 new jobs.\n- Asahi Group Holdings, one of the largest Japanese beverage makers, announced a $35 million investment to boost production at its Wisconsin plant.\n- Merck opened its $1 billion North Carolina manufacturing facility as it plans to invest $8 billion in the U.S. over the next several years.\nMeanwhile, new reports indicate migration to the U.S. through Panama’s Darien Gap has dropped by 99% and would-be illegal border crossers are turning around amid the Trump Administration’s commitment to border security.\nAmerica is roaring back."

    "content": "MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES\nSubject:       Ensuring the Enforcement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c)\nIn recent weeks, activist organizations fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars in donations and sometimes even Government grants have obtained sweeping injunctions far beyond the scope of relief contemplated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, functionally inserting themselves into the executive policy making process and therefore undermining the democratic process.\nThis anti-democratic takeover is orchestrated by forum-shopping organizations that repeatedly bring meritless suits, used for fundraising and political grandstanding, without any repercussions when they fail.  Taxpayers are forced not only to cover the costs of their antics when funding and hiring decisions are enjoined, but must needlessly wait for Government policies they voted for.  Moreover, this situation results in the Department of Justice, the Nation’s chief law enforcement agency, dedicating substantial resources to fighting frivolous suits instead of defending public safety.\nThe effective administration of justice in the Federal courts depends on mechanisms that deter frivolous litigation, protect parties from unwarranted costs, and streamline judicial processes.  One key mechanism is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) (Rule 65(c)), which mandates that a party seeking a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order (injunction) provide security in an amount that the court considers proper to cover potential costs and damages to the enjoined or restrained party if the injunction is wrongly issued.  Consistent enforcement of this rule is critical to ensuring that taxpayers do not foot the bill for costs or damages caused by wrongly issued preliminary relief by activist judges and to achieving the effective administration of justice.\nTherefore, it is the policy of the United States to demand that parties seeking injunctions against the Federal Government must cover the costs and damages incurred if the Government is ultimately found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.  Federal courts should hold litigants accountable for their misrepresentations and ill-granted injunctions.\nConsistent with applicable law, the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies), in consultation with the Attorney General, are directed to ensure that their respective agencies properly request under Rule 65(c) that Federal district courts require plaintiffs to post security equal to the Federal Government’s potential costs and damages from a wrongly issued injunction.  The scope of this directive covers all lawsuits filed against the Federal Government seeking an injunction where agencies can show expected monetary damages or costs from the requested preliminary relief, unless extraordinary circumstances justify an exception.\nIn requests for security under Rule 65(c), agencies shall include, among other things, that:\n(a)  Rule 65(c) mandates the court to require, in all applicable cases, that a movant for an injunction post security in an amount that the court considers proper to cover potential costs and damages to the enjoined or restrained party;\n(b)  the security amount the agency is requesting is based on a reasoned assessment of the potential harm to the enjoined or restrained party; and\n(c)  failure of the party that moved for preliminary relief to comply with Rule 65(c) results in denial or dissolution of the requested injunctive relief.\nThis memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J. TRUMP\n"

    "content": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Joint Base Andrews\n(March 9, 2025)\n7:08 P.M. EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.\nQ    Hi, Mr. President.\nQ    Hello.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  How are you?  Very good.  Wow, it’s a lot of people.  That’s a lot of people.  Any questions?\nQ    Sir, on Russia.  Have you made a final decision about what sanctions or tariffs you might impose on Russia and when that might be?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’re looking at a lot of things.  We have big meetings coming up, as you know, in Saudi Arabia.  That’s going to include Russia.  It’ll be Ukraine.  We’ll see if we can get something done.  I’d like to get something done.\nA lot of people died this week, as you know, in Ukraine. Not only Ukrainians, but Russians.  So, I think everybody wants to see it get done.  We’re going to make a lot of progress, I believe, this week.\nQ    Mr. President, is Putin disrespecting you by attacking Ukraine when you’re trying to make peace there?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Who?  Who?\nQ    Is President Putin disrespecting you by attacking Ukraine when you’re trying to make peace there?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  What did he do?\nQ    Well, he’s attacked Ukraine.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Is he disrespecting me?\nQ    Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Who are you with?\nQ    I’m Michael Birnbaum, with the Washington Post.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You’ve lost a lot of credibility.\nGo ahead.  What else?\nQ    What do you say to Americans who have seen their retirements accounts fall in recent day and are getting very nervous about these tariff conversations?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I think the tariffs are going to be the greatest thing we’ve ever done as a country.  It’s going to make our country rich again.\nWe have many companies — as you know, auto companies are opening up plants now.  We’ve had four or five announced already, but many more are coming.  And we’re basically going to take back the money — a lot of the money that we’ve given away over many decades.\nWe’ve lost our jobs.  We’ve lost our factories.  We’ve lost 90,000 factories since the beginning of NAFTA.  It’s not that long ago.  Ninety thousand factories.  Think of that.  And we’re going to get them back.  And they’re coming back, and they’re coming back in records.\nLook at what happened with the big chip company — the biggest in the world — by far, the most powerful chip company in the world, from Taiwan.  And they’re going in with $200 billion of money, and they’re going to build something that’s going to give us 35, 40 percent of the chip market in one — just in one company.\nNo, it’s going to bring it back, and I think it’s going to make to bring us to a level that we’ve never had before.\nQ    Is there going to be a government shutdown this week?\nQ    Mr. President, many of your supporters are concerned about conservative — that they’re — your supporters are attacking SCOTUS Justice Amy Coney Barrett.  You put her on the bench.  She — they’re saying she’s a DEI hire.  Do you regret putting her on the bench?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Look, she’s a very good woman.  She’s very smart.  And I don’t know about people attacking her.  I really don’t know.  I think she’s a very good woman, and she’s very smart.\nQ    Is there going to be a government shutdown at the end of this week?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It could happen.  I mean, the Democrats want that.  They want to destroy the country.  So, I can’t tell you, but it could happen.  It shouldn’t have happened, and it probably won’t.  I think the CR is going to get passed.  We’ll see.  But it could happen.  You never know.\nThe Democrats are out of control.  You saw that the other night during the speech when they wouldn’t stand up for two of the young ladies were killed by illegal aliens, one with the cancer — the young man with the cancer.  And all you want to do is stand up and applaud the man and the boy, the young boy.  And nobody has ever seen anything like that.  They’re out of control.  They’ve lost their minds.\nQ    Mr. President, are you alarmed by escalatory rhetoric —\nQ    Sir, do you think there’s going to be a deal on TikTok?\nQ    — from the Chinese in response to your tariffs, and are you planning to meet with Xi Jinping about trade anytime soon?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, they took that rhetoric back, as you know.  They were very tough.  And I said, “Whoa, what’s that all about?”  And that rhetoric was taken back.  You know that, right?\nQ    My question to you is are you —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I mean, but if you know that, why would you ask that question?\nQ    Are you planning to meet with Xi Jinping anytime soon?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, at some point I will.  I have a very good relationship with President Xi.  Very good.  And at some point, I’ll be meeting with him.\nQ    Sir, do you think there’s going to be a deal on TikTok soon?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  There could be.  We’re dealing with four different groups, and a lot of people want it, and it’s up to me.  So, there could be.\nQ    What are you leaning towards?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  All four are good.\nQ    Mr. President —\nQ    Mr. President —\nQ    — you have said there’s no feud between your Cabinet members and Elon Musk.  You even had dinner with him last night and Secretary Rubio.  However, tensions are high between your Cabinet and Mr. Musk.  How are you going to simmer down tensions?  Does Mr. Musk need to back off a little bit?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t think the tensions are high.  Look, Elon is a very special person, and these Cabinet people are special people.  You know, these are very successful people, or they wouldn’t have gotten — you know, they’ve attained the highest heights of government.  And I think they have fantastic relationship to Elon.\nAnd DOGE has been incredible.  You know, hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and fraud and abuse has been already found.  And that doesn’t mean they don’t have a little bit of an argument here and there about something or maybe personnel arguments.\nThere’s not too many contract arguments.  You know, contracts have been found.  This is much more than just personnel.  And we found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraudulent contracts — or very wasteful, but I think fraud.  I think it’s fraud.\nQ    There was just another plane crash in Pennsylvania.\nTHE PRESIDENT: I actually think they — I think, really, the Cabinet — for the most part, I think they get along really well with Elon.\nQ    There was just another plane crash in Pennsylvania.  Today, Secretary Duffy’s big concern is his department is being gutted.  He’s been, you know, dealing with these crashes ever since he was sworn in.  Does he have a legitimate concern with Elon Musk —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, that has nothing to do with the department.  That was a small plane, and that would have happened whether you had a big department or a small department, as you understand.\nIt’s just they’re in — they have spates like this.  You know, they have times when things happen a little bit more often than normal.  And then it goes back, and you go many years without having a problem.\nI’ll tell you, I think the Southwest pilot did a fantastic job last week when he lifted that plane off there, because if he put the brakes on, that wouldn’t have been good.  And I think the license should be maybe revoked for the plane that got in the way — from the pilot — revoked for the plane that got its way.  But the way he immediately stepped on the gas and lifted up, as opposed to, you know, thinking for about three seconds when it would have been too late.  The Southwest pilot, or pilots, they did a great job.\nQ    Russia, China, and Iran are doing military exercises together.  Does that concern you?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, not at all.  Not at all.\nQ    Why not?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Because we’re stronger than all of them.  We have more power than all of them.\nI rebuilt the military.  Unfortunately, Biden did nothing with it, but I rebuilt the military.  But we don’t want to even talk about that.\nI think if you look at what’s happening, and if you see what we’ve done, and if you see where we’ve come — and let’s see what happens with the whole Russia-Ukraine thing.  I think you’re going to have, eventually — and maybe not in the distant future, you’re going to have some pretty good results coming out of Saudi Arabia this week.\nQ    Are you going to resume aid to Ukraine if they sign the minerals deal with you?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think they will sign the minerals deal.  But we want them to — I want them to want peace.  Right now.\nQ    How do they show that?  How do they show that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, right now, they haven’t shown it to the extent that they should.  I think, right now, they haven’t, but I think they will be, and I think it’s going to become evident over the next two or three days.  I think eventually, look, we have to have peace.\nAnd I’m doing this — money is one thing.  We’re going to lose — we spent $350 billion on this.  But the big thing: human life.  Thousands of people — this week — thousands of young soldiers died this week.  Hundreds of people died in cities in Ukraine.  And we got to get it stopped.\nIt would have never happened if I was president.  And it didn’t happen.  This was not going to happen.\nBy the way, October 7th wouldn’t have happened.  Inflation wouldn’t have happened.  The Afghanistan — the way they — not that they left, but the way that they left.  It looked so bad.  Probably the most embarrassing day in the history of our country.  That wouldn’t have happened.  A lot of things wouldn’t have happened, but it is what it is.\nI think we’re going to have a good time.  I think we’re going to have a good result in Saudi Arabia — meaning they’re hosting the various talks, and we have a lot of good people going out there.  And I think Ukraine is going to do well, and I think Russia is going to do well.  I think some very big things could happen this week.  I hope so.\nSo, 2,000 people — at least 2,000 young soldiers have died this week, and this is almost on a constant basis.  A couple of thousand soldiers a week.  It’s a killing field, and we got to stop it.  And if I can stop it, I’ll be very happy.\nQ    Would you consider — would you consider —\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Would you consider lifting the intel pause on Ukraine?  What does Ukraine have to do?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we just about have.  I mean, we really just about have.  And we want to do anything we can to get Ukraine to be serious about getting something done.\nYou know, I say they don’t have the cards.  Nobody really has the cards.  Russia doesn’t have the cards.  They don’t.\nWhat you have to do is you have to make a deal, and you have to stop the killing.  It’s a senseless war, and we’re going to get it stopped.\nQ    You hesitated when Maria Bartiromo —\n(Cross-talk.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Where are we?  Are we just about —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yes, sir, we’re landing.\nQ    We’re close.  We’re close.\nMS. LEAVITT:  They’re trying to land the plane.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’re just about ready to land.\nQ    Are you worried about a recession?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No.\nQ    Maria Bartiromo asked you, and — and you kind of hesitated.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’ll tell you what, of course you hesitate.  Who knows?\nAll I know is this: We’re going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, and we’re going to become so rich, you’re not going to know where to spend all that money.  I’m telling you, you just watch.  We’re going to have jobs.  We’re going to have open factories.  It’s going to be great.\nAnd the plane is landing.\nMS. LEAVITT:  We’ve got to go.  Thanks, guys.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And thank you for a lot of good questions.  Okay?\nThank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.\nEND                7:18 P.M. EST\n"

    "content": "This morning, President Donald J. Trump and his administration were on the airwaves in force as they explained how, in just seven weeks, the Golden Age of America is here.\nHere’s what you missed:\n- On pausing tariffs on certain imports: “I wanted to help the American car makers — until April 2nd. April 2nd, it becomes all reciprocal — what they charge us, we charge them.”\n- On Democrats’ disgusting behavior during his joint address: “There’s something wrong with them. I can’t even believe it … They were talking about men playing in women’s sports … Republicans were going wild and the Democrats were having their little signs up — their little signs, their little, tiny signs … It’s unbelievable. They don’t get it.”\n- On resurrecting American shipbuilding: “What we’re doing is we’re building a tremendous foundation for the future … You just saw one of the biggest shipbuilders in the world in the Oval Office … He’s announcing a $20 billion investment in the United States.”\n- On Ukrainian President Zelensky: “He took money out of this country, under Biden, like candy from a baby … I just don’t think he’s grateful.”\n- On Russia: “Nobody has been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump … The biggest job they’ve ever done was the pipeline, Nord Stream 2… They were going to supply Germany and everybody else all over Europe. And what did I do? I stopped it.”\n- On the Panama Canal: “The Carter administration gave the Panama Canal, for $1, gave the Panama Canal to Panama for no reason … We’re taking the Panama Canal back.”\n- On protecting Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security: “I’m not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we’re going to get fraud out of there … Everybody wants us to get the fraud out, and therefore you’ll make it better.”\n- On DOGE: “What [Elon Musk] has done is unbelievable … He has found hundreds of billions of dollars worth of fake contracts.”\n- On education: “We want to bring the schools back to the states because we have, literally, we have the worst education department and education in the world … We’re ranked at the bottom of the list, and yet we’re number one when it comes to cost per pupil.”\n- On illegal border crossings reaching record lows: “This isn’t Joe Biden’s world anymore. This is President Donald Trump’s country — where we have a border, where we have laws, and it applies equally to everybody.”\n- On deporting criminal illegal immigrants: “We have almost 700 gang members that have been deported out of the country in just a month.”\n- On Biden’s failure to secure the border: “President Biden didn’t follow the law. He didn’t follow the law in the fact that it’s always been equally applied until his administration and then he made decisions to ignore federal law in how he handled immigration and enforcement within our borders.”\n- On holding Mexico and Canada accountable for fentanyl: “In the past, promises have been made by both Mexico and Canada that they didn’t follow through on … Every day in this country, people are dying of overdoses.”\n- On the February jobs report: “In just one month alone, after losing 110,000 manufacturing jobs, we made 10,000 in February alone — 9,000 of them were auto jobs.”\n- On tariffs: “We’ll unleash America out to the world, grow our economy in a way we’ve never grown before. You are going to see over the next two years the greatest set of growth coming from America.”\n- On government funding: [The continuing resolution] “freezes spending while allowing the government to continue to function, allowing ICE agents and Border Patrol to continue their mass deportation effort, allows President Trump’s cabinet continue to identify waste, fraud, and abuse across the federal bureaucracy — so the president supports this CR, and we’re hopeful and expect Republicans to get on board so we can pass it and continue moving forward implementing President Trump’s agenda.”\n"

Trump signed an Executive Order to end taxpayer-funded student loan forgiveness for anti-American activists.\n- The Order directs the Secretary of Education to revise the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program to exclude from eligibility organizations that engage in activities that have a substantial illegal purpose.\n- It stops taxpayer funds from subsidizing through loan forgiveness activities that advance illegal immigration, terrorism, child abuse, discrimination, and public disruptions.\n- It refocuses PSLF on its original intent of encouraging Americans to enter essential public service roles, such as nursing, rather than activist groups.\n- It protects national security and American values by ending federal support for organizations that harm American values and the public interest.\nCORRECTING THE ABUSE OF THIS FORGIVENESS PROGRAM BY THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION: President Trump believes that organizations whose activities have a substantial illegal purpose shall not be eligible for public service loan forgiveness.\n- The PSLF program was created in 2007 to encourage Americans to enter critical public service jobs by forgiving the student loans of those who take such jobs after 10 years of service and loan payments.\n- The current eligibility rules allow people working for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that advance illegal immigration, terrorism, discrimination, and violent protests to obtain taxpayer-funded loan forgiveness.\n\nThe Biden Administration was accused of using the student loan forgiveness program to pay pro-Palestinian and pro-Hamas activists and criminals with taxpayer dollars.\n- The Biden Administration was accused of using the student loan forgiveness program to pay pro-Palestinian and pro-Hamas activists and criminals with taxpayer dollars.\n- Further, the prior administration’s waiver process misused taxpayer funds to forgive loans years early.\n\nBiden made immediate forgiveness available for people who didn’t pay the full amount, didn’t pay on time, or didn’t even enroll in the right repayment plan.\n- Biden made immediate forgiveness available for people who didn’t pay the full amount, didn’t pay on time, or didn’t even enroll in the right repayment plan.\n- Prior to Biden taking office, PSLF had forgiven debt for just 7,000 borrowers, but Biden ballooned this program to erase student loans for over 1 million borrowers.\n- This abuse has increased the cost of tuition, burdened students with debt, and encouraged them to join organizations that undermine national security and the societal good.\n- This Executive Order corrects this abuse by ensuring only legitimate public servants benefit, not those engaged in illegal or harmful activities.\nSTOPPING TAXPAYER DOLLARS FROM FUNDING RADICAL AGENDAS: President Trump is ensuring American values guide the use of taxpayer funds.\n- By signing this Executive Order, President Trump continues to fulfill his promise to halt taxpayer funding of radical agendas.\nThis action builds on others he has taken in his second term to align taxpayer dollars with American values, including by terminating radical “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) preferences in federal contracting, reinstating the Mexico City Policy to stop federal funding of abortion overseas, and ending radical indoctrination in K-12 schooling."

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:Section 1.  Purpose.  In 2007, the Congress established the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program to encourage Americans to enter the public service sector by promising to forgive their remaining student loans after they completed 10 years of service in those jobs while making 10 years of minimum payments.\nThe prior administration abused the PSLF Program through a waiver process, using taxpayer funds to pay off loans for employees still years away from the statutorily required number of payments.  Moreover, instead of alleviating worker shortages in necessary occupations, the PSLF Program has misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.  The PSLF Program also creates perverse incentives that can increase the cost of tuition, can load students in low-need majors with unsustainable debt, and may push students into organizations that hide under the umbrella of a non-profit designation and degrade our national interest, thus requiring additional Federal funding to correct the negative societal effects caused by these organizations’ federally subsidized wrongdoing.\nAs President of the United States, I have a duty to protect, preserve, and defend the Constitution and our national security, which includes ending the subsidization of illegal activities, including illegal immigration, human smuggling, child trafficking, pervasive damage to public property, and disruption of the public order, which threaten the security and stability of the United States.  Accordingly, it is the policy of my Administration that individuals employed by organizations whose activities have a substantial illegal purpose shall not be eligible for public service loan forgiveness.     Sec. 2.  Restoring Public Service Loan Forgiveness.  The Secretary of Education shall propose revisions to 34 C.F.R. 685.219, Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury as appropriate, that ensure the definition of “public service” excludes organizations that engage in activities that have a substantial illegal purpose, including:\n(a)  aiding or abetting violations of 8 U.S.C. 1325 or other Federal immigration laws;\n(b)  supporting terrorism, including by facilitating funding to, or the operations of, cartels designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1189, or by engaging in violence for the purpose of obstructing or influencing Federal Government policy;\n(c)  child abuse, including the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children or the trafficking of children to so-called transgender sanctuary States for purposes of emancipation from their lawful parents, in violation of applicable law;\n(d)  engaging in a pattern of aiding and abetting illegal discrimination; or\n(e)  engaging in a pattern of violating State tort laws, including laws against trespassing, disorderly conduct, public nuisance, vandalism, and obstruction of highways.Sec. 3.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n"

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Well, thank you very much everyone.  Great honor to have you.  I know you’ve all been working very hard and very successfully.  And it’s a wonderful place, the White House.\nI want to begin — is Gianni here from World Cup?  I want to thank you for this election, and they just had a presentation in the Oval Office, and I thought this was such a beautiful — this is the trophy.  This is a big deal.  The World Cup is the biggest sporting event.\nAnd Gianni Infantino is my friend for a long time.  And during my first term, we worked out a deal to get the World Cup.  And then, because of lots of interesting things that happened, I ended up being president when it showed up.  I was always disappointed I wasn’t going to make it.  I was going to serve eight straight.  Instead, we did it the — we did it the hard way, but maybe the more important way.\nSo, I will be with you as president, Gianni.  So, maybe you could just say a few words and show how beautiful the World Cup trophy is.  Thank you.\nMR. INFANTINO:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, sure.  Please.\nMR. INFANTINO:  This is —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nMR. INFANTINO:  — the famous key.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s a great key.\nMR. INFANTINO:  You want to open it, President, or shall I?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, you go ahead.  (Laughter.)  I trust you.\nMR. INFANTINO:  So, this is the new trophy of a new competition.  It’s called the FIFA Club World Cup — the 32 best clubs in the world with the absolute best players in the world.  And for the first time in history, this competition takes place in United States.  Opening game on the 14th of June —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\nMR. INFANTINO:  — opening day in Miami.  Final on on the 13th of July, this year, in New York/New Jersey.  But it’s not that.  The trophy is special because it has a key and because, as you can see, if I manage to do it — it’s a bit tricky.  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Wow.\nMR. INFANTINO:  So, this is trophy.  It is a trophy which represents — and that’s why I think it’s interesting to show this trophy exactly in this forum here, because it represents the past, but it’s also projected to the future.  There is no other sports trophy which looks like that.\nIt has engraved a history of the game of soccer — or football, as we call it — the participating teams on the first edition, the stadiums — beautiful stadiums in the United States — the United States of America where this competition will take place.  So, at the same time, past, present, and projected for the future.\nAnd if I may, President, say another two words and then I let you work.  I’d like to congratulate the president and the administration for — not only for the World Cup — the Global Cup, the World Cup, and the great work done, but also for this initiative that you are speaking about here.\nIf I may add something in this respect, I’m not an expert at all, but FIFA, as you know, is a brand which is globally known and a very strong brand.  The soccer economy in the world is worth around $170 billion a year.  Seventy percent of that, Mr. President, is in Europe.  So. imagine the potential that there is around the world, only in soccer, if we develop it.\nAnd so, FIFA is very, very interested, under my presidency, to develop a FIFA coin — to do it from here, from America, and to conquer the 5 billion soccer fans in the world.\nSo, if there is anyone here who is interested to team up with FIFA — (laughter) — here we are together with the United States of America, and we will conquer the world of soccer with the FIFA coin.\nThank you very much.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That coin — (applause) — that coin may be worth more than FIFA in the end.  It could be quite a coin, actually.  (Laughter.)\nAnyway, thank you, Gianni.  Great job.\nI just thought you should see this trophy, because it’s really — you know, it’s the biggest sporting event in the world, and we have it here, and we appreciate being selected.  Thank you very much, Gianni.  You do a fantastic job.\nAnd welcome to the first-ever White House Digital Asset Summit.  I know that many of you have been fighting for years for this, and it’s an honor to be with you at the White House.\nI want to thank the White House AI and crypto czar, David Sacks.  Treasury secretary — this is David right here, in case you don’t know.  You know David.\nAnd a man who’s doing a great job as the secretary of Treasury, Scott Bessent, who’s right here.  Scott, thank you very much.\nCommerce secretary, Howard Lutnick — wherever you may be, Howard.\nMR. SACKS:  Right there.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Hi, Howard.\nSECRETARY LUTNICK:  How are you?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s doing some interesting work right now with all that’s going on.  He’s right in the middle of it, and doing a great job.  Thank you.\nSBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler.  And hi, Kel.\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce.  Thank you, Hester.\nActing CFTC Chairman Caroline Pham.\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer.  Hello, Tom.\nREPRESENTATIVE EMMER:  Hello, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Representative Bryan Steil, thank you.\nREPRESENTATIVE STEIL:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Bryan, thank you very much.\nDigital Assets Council Director Bo Hines.  Good, Bo.  Great job.\nAnd many other distinguished guests.  We have a lot of very distinguished people around the table.  Some of them will be speaking.\nI want to thank Marco Rubio also, who’s right over there.  And we have tremendous people very interested in this subject.\nAnd last year, I promised to make America the Bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet.  And we’re taking historic action to deliver on that promise.\nAs you know around the table, yesterday, I signed an executive order officially creating our Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and this will be a virtual Fort Knox for digital gold to be housed within the United States Treasury.  Right?  That’s a big thing, Scott.  (Applause.)  That’s good.\nThe federal government is already among the largest holders of Bitcoin, as you know — really one of the largest holders in the world, with as many as 200,000 Bitcoin obtained via civil law and various other forms of law and including enforcement actions.  These existing holdings will form the foundation of the new reserve.\nUnfortunately, in recent years, the U.S. government has foolishly sold tens of thousands of additional Bitcoin that were worth billions and billions of dollars had they not sold them.  But they did sell them, mostly during the Biden administration, and not a good thing to have done.\nFrom this day on, America will follow the rule that every Bitcoin knows very well, never sell your Bitcoin.  That’s a little phrase that they have.  I don’t know if that’s right or not.  Who the hell knows, right?  (Laughter and applause.)\nWho knows?  Who knows?  But so far, it’s been right, and let’s keep it that way.\nThe Treasury and Commerce departments will also explore new pathways to accumulate additional Bitcoin holdings for the reserve, provided it’s done at no cost to the taxpayers.  We don’t want any cost to the taxpayers.\nIn addition, my order directs federal agencies to conduct an inventory of all crypto assets currently held by the U.S. government and determine how they can be transferred easily to the Treasury.\nNon-Bitcoin digital assets will be held at a new U.S. digital assets stockpile where they will be managed properly.\nMy administration also is working to end the federal bureaucracy’s war on crypto, which was really going on pretty wildly during Biden, until the election came about.  About five months before the election, he became a big fan because he heard how many people were in favor of it and how many people love it and respect it.  But I guess it didn’t work out too well for him.  People understood what was going on.\nAnd paved the way for groundbreaking innovations in institutional finance.\nUnder the Bitcoin administration, regulators strongarmed banks.  I mean, they really did.  They strongarmed banks into closing the accounts of crypto businesses and entrepreneurs, effectively blocking some money transfers to and from exchanges, and they weaponized government against the entire industry.\nBut I know that feeling also.  (Laughter.)  Maybe better than you do.  (Laughter.)\nAll of that will soon be over.  And we are ending Operation Choke Point 2.0.  (Applause.)\nPARTICIPANT:  Hear, hear!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, some people really suffered.  It was ridiculous what they were doing.  But in the end, they came around, but they came around for the wrong reasons.  They came around only because they wanted votes and they saw that tens of millions of people are — you know, were against them because of what they were doing.\nI also want to express my strong support for the efforts of lawmakers in Congress as they work on bills to provide regulatory certainty for dollar-backed stablecoins and the digital assets market.  They’re working very hard on that.  This is a tremendous opportunity for economic growth and innovation in our financial sector and will really go a long way.  I think there’s going to be a tremendous — we feel like pioneers, in a way — a tremendous method of growth.\nAnd things are very much tied, and we want to keep it that way — the U.S. dollar — long into the future.  We’re going to keep it that way.\nI hope lawmakers will send that legislation to my desk before August recess, if they can.  And they’re very much working with you.  And you know a lot of them, and a lot of them were committed right from the very beginning.\nSo, I just want to congratulate you all for being at the White House today.  And a man who knows more about Bitcoin and AI and just about everything else than anybody — David Sacks.  And I’d like to have you say a few words, David.\nMR. SACKS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  We’re all here today because of your leadership, your vision, and your generosity.  And I really want to thank you for that.\nI — we’re also here because of your desire to make America great and to introduce a golden age in America, including for digital assets.  And we’re here because of your love of — of innovators or, as you might say, high-IQ people.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, high-IQ people.  (Laughter.)\nMR. SACKS:  We know you lo- — love high-IQ people.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We like them.\nMR. SACKS:  And we have — we have about 30 of them here in the room today.  These are the top people in the — in the digital asset industry.\nAnd I — and one other thing that I think that you love is — is legal fairness.  This is an industry that was subjected to prosecution and persecution for the last four years, horrible lawfare, and nobody knows what that feels like better than you do.  So, we really appreciate the fact that you understand legal fairness and that you’re always willing to fight for the right — for the right thing, for legal fairness.  You never back down.  You stand defiant, even in the face of an assassin’s bullet.\nIt’s an inspiration to everyone in this room, I think.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nMR. SACKS:  So, it’s an honor — (applause).\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s very nice.  Thank you.  Thank you.\nMR. SACKS:  So, I just want to say, it’s — it’s an honor to work for you.  It’s an honor to — to work for a president who — who works every day to get so much done on behalf of the American people.\nYour administration is moving at tech speed.  It’s really amazing.  It’s actually faster than any startup that I’ve been a part of.  (Laughter.)  Is — your administration moves even faster.\nSo, I just want to say thank you for having me be a part of it.  I’ve enjoyed every minute of it, I love working for you, and thank you again for this opportunity.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, David, very much.  Appreciate it.\nMR. SACKS:  And — (applause).\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Scott.\nMR. SACKS:  And now I just want to pass the ball to Secretary Bessent to say something.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Scott.\nSECRETARY BESSENT:  David.\nSo, the — today, when President Trump has signed the executive order to Establish the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Stockpile, we’re going to position the United States as a leader among nations in the digital asset strategy.  It’s important for the United States to recognize this fact and get ahead of the other nations in the digital age.\nWe applaud the president’s direction to use the digital assets already in possession of the nation, and we are going to establish this Bitcoin reserve.  We will use this authority to augment the assets side of the United States balance sheet.\nAs I’ve said many times, President Trump is creating assets for the American people, while most past presidents have created debt.  And a large part of this asset program can be in digital assets.\nWe are going to end the regulatory weaponization against digital assets.  The Biden administration’s actions did nothing other than publish and — punish innovators, and that all of you have made it here today is really a testament to your fortitude.\nMuch of Treasury’s responsibility in this order relates to the tax code and determinations around risk waivings.  And I’m here to assure you that we are going to work with the controller of the currency, the IRS, and we’re going to resend and amend all applicable previous guidance.\nAnd we are going to put a lot of thought into the stablecoin regime.  And as President Trump has directed, we are going to keep the U.S. the dominant reserve currency in the world, and we will use stablecoins to do that.\nThank you.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Scott.\nHoward.\nSECRETARY LUTNICK:  Technology is at the foundation of the Trump presidency.  He understands technology, he embraces technology, and he’s going to use technology to drive America forward.  The blockchain and Bitcoin technology are a key part of that thinking and embracing that.  And here today shows how much a leader the Trump administration and our president is.  He understands it.  He embraces it.\nAs you said, you’re a pioneer in this place, and this is where we’re going.  We’re using the blockchain.  We’re using Bitcoin.  We are going to use digital assets to pound forward, and Donald Trump is leading the way.\nCan’t be more proud of you today.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Howard.  (Applause.)\nKelly, go ahead, please.\nADMINISTRATOR LOEFFLER:  Thank you, Mr. President.  This is truly a historic day.  And as a crypto founder, I couldn’t be more proud to be part of your administration.  You’re moving at the speed of tech, for sure.\nAnd I will just say, it’s gr- — a great day to have the war on not just crypto, but the war on innovation done.  And under your administration, we are truly going to enter under the gold — into the golden age.\nAnd I’ll just say, as the administrator of the SBA: Small business is a tremendous network that crypto can be deployed against, and so the SBA is open to crypto.  So, I look forward to working with all of the leaders in this room to advance your efforts here.\nThank you.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Kelly.  Thank you very much.\nTom, please.\nREPRESENTATIVE EMMER:  Well, Mr. President, I want to say thank you.  I want to thank you for the amazing team that you put together.  I want to thank you for David.\nI mean this — this kind of a meeting — no one in this room could have envisioned this just a couple years ago.  You are the one that has the vision.  You’re the one that did — said we are going to do 21st century finance right here in the United States of America.\nI’ve been doing this for nine years.  It is amazing how far we’ve come, and that’s a credit to you, Mr. President, and your leadership.  And God bless you for doing this, because it’s going to make a huge difference with everything else you’re doing.\nAnd, by the way, Americans love it.  They’re going crazy.  Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Tom.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you very much.\nAnybody else?\nMR. SACKS:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead, please.\nMR. SACKS:  Does anyone want to say a couple of words?  Cameron or Tyler, do you want to —\nMR. ARMSTRONG: I’ll say —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You’re very shy in front of the cameras.\nMR. SACKS:  Actually, Cam- — Cameron, I — I think you said something earlier that I thought was really profound.  You said that a year ago you thought it would be more likely that you’d end up in jail than at the White House.  Do you — not to put you on the spot, because you didn’t do anything wrong, but that was the environment a year ago.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Hi, fellas.\nMR. SACKS:  But do you guys want to say something, either one of you?\nMR. CAMERON WINKLEVOSS:  Sure.  That was actually Tyler who said that.  (Laughter.)  But — but —\nMR. SACKS:  Sorry.  I still — I still get mixed up.\nMR. CAMERON WINKLEVOSS:  But yeah, we never thought that we’d be — get attacked the way we did in our backyard after trying to do the right thing for so many years and always trying to raise the bar with respect to regulation.  So, it’s truly wonderful to see how things have changed and how the pendulum has swung back in the way that it has.\nAnd we’ve always felt that the U.S. should lead in Bitcoin and crypto and it’s ours to sort of lead and win.\nAnd it’s just wonderful what President Trump has been doing with this, and we look forward to working together.\nAnd thanks for inviting us, David, and setting this up.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you both.\nPlease.\nMR. TYLER WINKLEVOSS:  I was just going to say thank you, Mr. President.  Cameron takes credit for a lot of my things I say, so it’s not the first time.  (Laughter.)\nBut the U.S. won the Internet, and the U.S. should win crypto.  So, thank you for your leadership on this.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you both very much.\nHigh-IQ individuals around this table.  That’s what I always say, we need high IQ.\nSo, thank you very much.  Would anybody like to say anything?\nMR. ARMSTRONG:  Sure.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Please.\nMR. SACKS:  Okay.  We’ll come around.\nMR. NAZAROV:  I just want to express my deep gratitude for the seriousness with which you’re approaching our industry and how you’re actually helping guide it in the right direction.\nI work with many central banks in other countries.  And when I was working there, I was wondering why I, as an American citizen, can’t help the United States financial system reach this higher level that the world is on course towards generally.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\nMR. NAZAROV:  And so, I’m very grateful that finally there’s been a new level of kind of common sense and — and adoption of — of these ideas.  Me and the other people in this room do believe that the crypto, blockchain, Web3 infrastructure is the next iteration of the financial system, and I think that the U.S. should have its leadership position continue in that new financial system.\nAnd I’m — I’m very, very happy to see people like David Sacks, Secretary Bessent, Secretary Lutnick taking this very seriously with their time, and very grateful to them too.  So, I’m — I’m just overjoyed to see this, and I think it is a big part of how the U.S. can continue its role in the global financial system.  So, thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I thought it was very important that we stay in the front of this one.  This is a big one.\nAnd as you know, China is pushing forward and very strongly as usual, but we’re way in the lead — as we are in AI and other things — and we want to stay there.  So, I thought this was very important.\nAnd we have some brilliant people sitting around this table, and it’s an honor to have you involved, but we want to stay at the forefront of everything.\nAnd this is a very important day in your lives.  I know you worked — some of you — very long, long before people really understood what was happening.  And so, I congratulate you.  But this is a big day.  Being in the White House is a big deal, and you have great support.\nThank you all very much.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nThank you.  Please.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, media.  Thank you.  Please.\nEND            4:06 P.M.

to centralize, secure, or maximize their value.\n- Taking affirmative steps to centralize ownership, control, and management of these assets within the Federal government will ensure proper oversight, accurate tracking, and a cohesive approach to managing the government’s cryptocurrency holdings.\n- This move harnesses the power of digital assets for national prosperity, rather than letting them languish in limbo.\nDELIVERING ON PLEDGE TO MAKE AMERICA THE CRYPTO CAPITAL OF THE WORLD: President Trump is fulfilling his promise to position America as the global leader in cryptocurrency.\n- President Trump promised to make the United States the “crypto capital of the world,” emphasizing the need to embrace digital assets to drive economic growth and technological leadership.\n- In his first week in office, President Trump signed an Executive Order to promote United States leadership in digital assets such as cryptocurrency.\n- President Trump has consistently advocated for a forward-thinking approach to crypto, stating: “I am very positive and open minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry. Our country must be the leader in the field.”\n- President Trump promised to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Assets Stockpile.\n- President Trump appointed a “crypto czar” and is hosting the first-ever crypto summit at the White House, just a few of the many ways this Administration is demonstrating its strong commitment to this digital asset.\n"

EST\n(March 4, 2025)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  It’s a great honor.  Thank you very much.\nSpeaker Johnson, Vice President Vance, the first lady of the United States — (applause) — members of the United States Congress, thank you very much.\nAnd to my fellow citizens, America is back.  (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the golden age of America.  From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country.\nWe have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years, and we are just getting started.  (Applause.)  Thank you.\nI return to this chamber tonight to report that America’s momentum is back, our spirit is back, our pride is back, our confidence is back, and the American dream is surging bigger and better than ever before.  (Applause.)  The American dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback, the likes of which the world has never witnessed and perhaps will never witness again.  There’s never been anything like it.  (Applause.)\nThe presidential election of November 5th was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades.  We won all seven swing states, giving us an electoral college victory of 312 votes.  (Applause.)  We won the popular vote —\nREPRESENTATIVE GREEN:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — by big numbers and won counties in our country —\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nAUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!\nREPRESENTATIVE GREEN:  You are — you have no right to cut Medicaid.\nAUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525 on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican.  (Applause.)\nNow, for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction.  In fact, it’s an astonishing record: 27-point swing, the most ever.  (Applause.)\nLikewise, small-business optimism saw its single largest one-month gain ever recorded.\nSPEAKER JOHNSON:  Mr. President —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  A 41-point jump.\n(Speaker Johnson strikes the gavel.)      SPEAKER JOHNSON:  Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the House and to cease any further disruptions.  That’s your warning.\nREPRESENTATIVE GREEN:  He has no mandate to cut Medicaid.\nSPEAKER JOHNSON:  Members are engaging in willful and continuing breach of decorum, and the chair is prepared to direct the sergeant at arms to restore order to the joint session.  (Applause.)\nMr. Green, take your seat.  Take your seat, sir.\nREPRESENTATIVE GREEN:  He has no mandate to cut Medicaid.\nSPEAKER JOHNSON:  Take your seat.\n(Cross-talk.)\nFinding that members continue to engage in willful and concerted disruption of proper decorum, the chair now directs the sergeant at arms to restore order.  (Applause.)  Remove this gentleman from the chamber.  (Applause.)\nREPRESENTATIVE GREEN:  Shame on all of you.     (Members of the audience sing “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye.”)\n(Cross-talk.)     You have no mandate.\nSPEAKER JOHNSON:  Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the House.\nMr. President, you can continue.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nOver the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 executive orders and taken more than 400 executive actions — a record — to restore common sense, safety, optimism, and wealth all across our wonderful land.  The people elected me to do the job, and I’m doing it.  (Applause.)\nIn fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency — it’s our presidency — (applause) — is the most successful in the history of our nation by many.  (Applause.)  And what makes it even more impressive is that — do you know who number two is?  George Washington.  How about that?  (Laughter and applause.)  How about that?  I don’t know about that list, but we’ll take it.\nWithin hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border — (applause) — and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country.  And what a job they’ve done.\nAs a result, illegal border crossings last month were, by far, the lowest ever recorded. Ever.  (Applause.)  They heard my words, and they chose not to come.  Much easier that way.\nIn comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history — (applause) — there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members, and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country.  Who would want to do that?\nThis is my fifth such speech to Congress, and, once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud.  Nothing I can do.  I could find a cure to the most devastating disease — a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded, and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand, and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements.  They won’t do it no matter what.\nFive times I’ve been up here.  It’s very sad, and it just shouldn’t be this way.  (Applause.)\nSo, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America?  For the good of our nation, let’s work together and let’s truly make America great again.  (Applause.)\nEvery day, my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs, to bring a future that America deserves, and we’re doing it.  This is a time for big dreams and bold action.\nUpon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid.  (Applause.)  I terminated the ridiculous Green New Scam.  I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying.  (Applause.)  I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization.  (Applause.)  And I also withdrew from the anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council.  (Applause.)\nWe ended all of Biden’s environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable.  And importantly, we ended the last administration’s insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our autoworkers and companies from economic destruction.  (Applause.)\nTo unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every 1 new regulation, 10 old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term.  (Applause.)  And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other president had done before.\nWe ordered all federal workers to return to the office.  They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job.  (Applause.)\nAnd we have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent, like me.  How did that work out? (Laughter.)  Not too good.  (Applause.)  Not too good.\nAnd I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America.  It’s back.  (Applause.)\nAnd two days ago, I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America.  (Applause.)\nI renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America.  (Applause.)\nAnd, likewise, I renamed — for a great president, William McKinley — Mount McKinley again.  (Applause.)  Beautiful Alaska.  We love Alaska.\nWe’ve ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and, indeed, the private sector and our military.  (Applause.)  And our country will be woke no longer.  (Applause.)\nWe believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer, or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender.  Very important.  (Applause.)  You should be hired based on merit.  And the Supreme Court, in a brave and very powerful decision, has allowed us to do so.\nThank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nWe have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools.  And I signed an order making it the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.  (Applause.)\nI also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women’s sports.  (Applause.)      Three years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete — one of the best — preparing for a future in college sports.  But when her girls’ volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton’s face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side, and ending her athletic career.  It was a shot like she’s never seen before.  She’s never seen anything like it.\nPayton is here tonight in the gallery.  And, Payton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls’ team or they will lose all federal funding.  (Applause.)\nAnd if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the woman’s boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming, or cycling, where a male recently finished a long-distance race five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record by five hours.  Broke the record by five hours.\nIt’s demeaning for women, and it’s very bad for our country.  We’re not going to put up with it any longer.  (Applause.)\nWhat I have just described is only a small fraction of the commonsense revolution that is now, because of us, sweeping the entire world.  Common sense has become a common theme, and we will never go back.  Never.  Never going to let that happen.  (Applause.)\nAmong my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families.  As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare.  Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans.  They’ve never had anything like it.\nWe suffered the worst inflation in 48 years but perhaps even in the history of our country. They’re not sure.  As president, I’m fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.  (Applause.)\nJoe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control.\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  The egg price is out of control, and we’re working hard to get it back down.\nSecretary, do a good job on that.  You inherited a total mess from the previous administration.  Do a good job.  (Applause.)\nA major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy.  The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95 percent, slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants.  We are opening up many of those power plants right now.  (Applause.)\nAnd, frankly, we have never seen anything like it.  That’s why, on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency.  (Applause.)  As you’ve heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth and by far.  And now I’ve fully authorized the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it.  It’s called drill, baby, drill.  (Applause.)\nMy administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska — among the largest in the world — where Japan, South Korea, and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each.  There’s never been anything like that one.  It will be truly spectacular.  It’s all set to go.  The permitting is gotten.\nAnd later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.  (Applause.)\nTo further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but we’ll be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.  (Applause.)  And to that end, I have created the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency – DOGE. (Applause.) Perhaps you’ve heard of it — perhaps — which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight.  (Applause.)\nThank you, Elon.  He’s working very hard.  He didn’t need this.  (Laughs.)  He didn’t need this.  Thank you very much.  We appreciate it.  Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it, I believe.  (Applause.)  They just don’t want to admit that.\nJust listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified.\n$22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens.\n$45 million for diversity, equity, and inclusion scholarships in Burma.\n$40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants.  Nobody knows what that is.  (Laughter.)\n$8 million to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of.  (Laughter.)\n$60 million for Indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America.  $60 million.\n$8 million for making mice transgender.  (Laughter.)  This is real.\n$32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova.\n$10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique.\n$20 million for the Arab “Sesame Street” in the Middle East.  It’s a program.  $20 million for a program.\n$1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee, headed up — and we know she’s involved — just at the last moment, the money was passed over — by a woman named Stacey Abrams.  Have you ever heard of her?\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  A $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring.\n$1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia.\n$14 million for social cohesion in Mali.\n$59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City.\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s a real estate developer.  He’s done very well.\n$250,000 to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia.\n$42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda.\n$14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia.\n$47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia.  Asia is doing very well with learning.  (Laughter.)  Don’t know what we’re doing.  We should use it ourselves.\nAnd $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education, the most ever paid.  Nothing even like it.\nUnder the Trump administration, all of these scams — and there are far worse, but I didn’t think it was appropriate to talk about them.  They’re so bad.  Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people, headed up by Elon.  And we appreciate it.  We’ve found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.  (Applause.)\nAnd we’ve taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things.  Taken back a lot of that money.  We got it just in time.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  This is just the beginning.  The Government Accountability Office, a federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation, and we are working very hard to stop it.  We’re going to.\nWe’re also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors and that our seniors and people that we love rely on.  Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119.  I don’t know any of them.  I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly.  (Laughter.)\n3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129.\n3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139.\n3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149.\nAnd money is being paid to many of them, and we’re searching right now.\nIn fact, Pam, good luck.  Good luck.  You’re going to find it.\nBut a lot of money is paid out to people because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does — and it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country.\n1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159.  And over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old.\nWe have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby.  (Laughter and applause.)\nIncluding, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229; one person between the age of 240 and 249; and one person is listed at 360 years of age.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  Joe Biden!  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: More than 100 years older than our country.\nBut we’re going to find out where that money is going, and it’s not going to be pretty.\nBy slashing all of the fraud, waste, and theft we can find, we will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors, and put more money in the pockets of American families.  (Applause.)\nAnd today, interest rates took a beautiful drop — big, beautiful drop.  It’s about time.\nAnd in the near future, I want to do what has not been done in 24 years: balance the federal budget.  We’re going to balance it.  (Applause.)\nWith that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the gold card, which goes on sale very, very soon.       For $5 million, we will allow the most successful, job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship.  It’s like the green card but better and more sophisticated.  (Laughter.)  And these people will have to pay tax in our country.  They won’t have to pay tax from where they came.  The money that they’ve made, you wouldn’t want to do that, but they have to pay tax, create jobs.\nThey’ll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them being forced out.  Number one at the top school, as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there.\nSo, while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers, and child predators who were allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people — the Democrats, the Biden administration — the open border, insane policies that you’ve allowed to destroy our country — we will now bring in brilliant, hardworking, job-creating people.  They’re going to pay a lot of money, and we’re going to reduce our debt with that money.  (Applause.)\nAmericans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change.  For nearly 100 years, the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America’s potential in every possible way.  The nation founded by pioneers and risk-takers now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt.\nApprovals that should take 10 days to get instead take 10 years, 15 years, and even 20 years before you’re rejected.  Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work.\nMy administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again. (Applause.)  Any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately — (applause) — because we are draining the swamp.  It’s very simple.  And the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over.  (Applause.)\nAnd the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody.  They’re in there.  They’re waiting for you to vote.  (Applause.)\nAnd I’m sure that the people on my right — I don’t mean the Republican right, but my right right here — I’m sure you’re going to vote for those tax cuts, because, otherwise, I don’t believe the people will ever vote you into office.  So, I’m doing you a big favor by telling you that.  (Applause.)\nBut I know this group is going to be voting for the taxes.  (Applause.)\nThank you.  It’s a very, very big part of our plan.  We had tremendous success in our first term with it.  A very big part of our plan.  We’re seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board.\nAnd to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation, I’m calling for no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors.  (Applause.)\n(Addressing Speaker Johnson.)  Good luck.\nAnd I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible but only if the car is made in America.  (Applause.)\nAnd, by the way, we’re going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody has ever seen.  Plants are opening up all over the place.  Deals are being made.  Never seen. That’s a combination of the election win and tariffs.\nIt’s a beautiful word, isn’t it?\nThat, along with our other policies, will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom.  It’s going to boom.  Spoke to the majors today — all three — the top people, and they’re so excited.  In fact, already, numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world.  (Applause.)\nAnd this has taken place since our great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country.  (Applause.)\nIn addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing.  And just as we did before, we will provide 100 percent expensing.  It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025, and it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country.  First term — we had a great first term.  (Applause.)\nIf you don’t make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and, in some cases, a rather large one.  Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it’s our turn to start using them against those other countries.\nOn average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico, and Canada — have you heard of them? — and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them.  It’s very unfair.  India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100 percent.  China’s average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them.  And South Korea’s average tariff is four times higher.  Think of that: four times higher.  And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea, but that’s what happens.\nThis is happening by friend and foe.  This system is not fair to the United States and never was.  And so, on April 2nd — I wanted to make it April 1st, but I didn’t want to be accused of April Fool’s Day.  (Laughter.)  Just one day, which cost us a lot of money.  (Laughter.)  But we’re going to do it in April. I’m a very superstitious person. April 2nd, reciprocal tariffs kick in.  And whatever they tariff us — other countries — we will tariff them.  That’s reciprocal, back and forth.  (Applause.)  Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.\nIf they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market.  There’s a lot of that too.  They don’t even allow us in their market.\nWe will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before.  I did it with China, and I did it with others.  And the Biden administration couldn’t do anything about it because it was so much money.  They couldn’t do anything about it.\nWe have been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer.  (Applause.)\nMuch has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them.  But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people — destroying families.  Nobody has ever seen anything like it.\nThey are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars.  We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico of hundreds of billions of dollars.  And the United States will not be doing that any longer.  We’re not going to do it any longer.  (Applause.)\nThanks to our America First policies we’re putting into place, we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks.  (Applause.)  The combination of the election and our economic policies — the people of SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200 billion investment.  OpenAI and Oracle — Larry Ellison — announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn’t have done if Kamala had won.  (Applause.)\nApple announced $500 billion investment.  Tim Cook called me.  He said, “I cannot spend it fast enough.”  It’s going to be much higher than that, I believe.  They’ll be building their plants here, instead of in China.\nAnd just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor — the biggest in the world, most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount — 97 percent of the market, announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the USA.  (Applause.)\nAnd we’re not giving them any money.  Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing.  We give hundreds of billions of dollars, and it doesn’t mean a thing.  They take our money, and they don’t spend it.  All that meant to them — we’re giving them no money.  All that was important to them was they didn’t want to pay the tariffs, so they came and they’re building.  And many other companies are coming.\nWe don’t have to give them money.  We just want to protect our businesses and our people.  And they will come because they won’t have to pay tariffs if they build in America.  And so, it’s very amazing.\nYou should get rid of the CHIP Act.  And whatever is left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to.  (Applause.)\nOur new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer — I love the farmer — (applause) — who will now be selling into our home market, the USA, because nobody is going to be able to compete with you.  Because those goods that come in from other countries and companies, they’re really, really in a bad position in so many different ways.  They’re uninspected.  They may be very dirty and disgusting, and they come in and they pour in, and they hurt our American farmers.\nThe tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America.  And our farmers, starting on April 2nd — it may be a little bit of an adjustment period.  We had that before, when I made the deal with China.  Fifty billion dollars of purchases, and I said, “Just bear with me,” and they did.  They did.  Probably have to bear with me again, and this will be even better.\nThat was great.  The problem with it was that Biden didn’t enforce it.  He didn’t enforce it.  Fifty billion dollars of purchases, and we were doing great, but Biden did not enforce it.  And it hurt our farmers, but our farmers are going to have a field day right now.\nSo, to our farmers, have a lot of fun.  I love you too.  I love you too.  (Applause.)  It’s all going to happen.\nAnd I have also imposed a 25 percent tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber, and steel, because if we don’t have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don’t have a military and, frankly, we just won’t have a country very long.\nHere today is a proud American steelworker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama.  Jeff Denard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department; raise seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole; and over the years, provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children.  So great, Jeff.  (Applause.)\nThank you, Jeff.  Thank you, Jeff.  (Applause.)\nStories like Jeff’s remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs.  They’re about protecting the soul of our country.  Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again.  And it’s happening, and it will happen rather quickly.\nThere will be a little disturbance, but we’re okay with that.  It won’t be much.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  No, we’re not!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, you’re not.  Oh.  (Laughter.)\nAnd look — and look where Biden took us.  Very low.  The lowest we’ve ever been.\nJeff, I want to thank you very much.\nAnd I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community.  She worked so hard on it.  A very loving person.  Our magnificent first lady of the United States.  (Applause.)\nMelania’s work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation’s future leaders as they enter the workforce.\nOur first lady is joined by two impressive young women — very impressive: Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the first lady’s Fostering the Future initiative and is poised to complete her education and become a teacher, and Elliston Berry, who became a victim of an illicit deepfake image produced by a peer.  With Elliston’s help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act —\nThis is so important.  Thank you very much, John.  John Thune, thank you.  (Applause.)  Stand up, John.  Thank you, John.  (Applause.)  Thank you all very much.  Thank you.\nAnd thank you to John Thune and the Senate.  A great job.\n— to criminalize the publication of such images online.  This terrible, terrible thing.  And once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law.  Thank you.\nAnd I’m going to use that bill for myself too, if you don’t mind — (laughter) — because nobody gets treated worse than I do online.  Nobody.  (Laughter.)\nThat’s great.  Thank you very much to the Senate.  Thank you.\nBut if we truly care about protecting America’s children, no step is more crucial than securing America’s borders.  Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States.  Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world.  Because of Joe Biden’s insane and very dangerous open border policies, they are now strongly embedded in our country, but we are getting them out and getting them out fast.  (Applause.)\nAnd I want to thank Tom Homan.  And, Kristi, I want to thank you.  And Paul of Border Patrol, I want to thank you.  What a job they’ve all done.  Everybody.  Border Patrol, ICE.  Law enforcement, in general, is incredible.  We have to take care of our law enforcement.  (Applause.)  We have to.\nLast year, a brilliant 22-year-old nursing student named Laken Riley — the best in her class, admired by everybody — went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia.  That morning, Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered.  Laken was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden’s open southern border and then set loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration.  It was indeed a failed administration.\nHe had then been arrested and released in a Democrat-run sanctuary city — a disaster — before ending the life of this beautiful young angel.\nWith us this evening are Laken’s beloved mother, Allyson, and her sister, Lauren.  (Applause.)\nLast year, I told Laken’s grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain.  That’s why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety.  It’s a very strong, powerful act.  (Applause.)  It’s called the Laken Riley Act.  (Applause.)\nSo, Allyson and Lauren, America will never, ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley.  (Applause.)\nThank you very much.\nSince taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history, and we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nThe media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation.  “We must have legislation to secure the border.”  But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president.  (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE:  Trump!  Trump!  Trump!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nJoe Biden didn’t just open our borders.  He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals, and communities throughout the country.  Entire towns, like Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody has ever seen before.  Beautiful towns destroyed.\nNow, just as I promised in my Inaugural Address, we are achieving the great liberation of America.  (Applause.)\nBut there still is much work to be done.\nHere tonight is a woman I have gotten to know: Alexis Nungaray from Houston.  Wonderful woman.  Last June, Alexis’s 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store.  She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge, and horrifically murdered.  Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela, released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border.\nThe death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly.\nAlexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter — your magnificent daughter.  And earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you.\nOne thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much.  She loved nature.  Across Galveston Bay from where Jocelyn lived in Houston, you will find a magnificent national wildlife refuge. A pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God’s creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America.\nAlexis, moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn.\nSo, Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order?  (Applause.)\n(The president holds up the executive order.)\nThank you very much.\nAll three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken’s murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang — the toughest gang, they say, in the world — known as Tren de Aragua.  Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations.  (Applause.)  They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that’s not good for them.\nCountless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration, but now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country, or, if they’re too dangerous, put in jails, standing trial in this country, because we don’t want them to come back ever.\nWith us this evening is a warrior on the front lines of that battle, Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz.  Great guy.  (Applause.)\nIn January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande, near an area known as Cartel Island — doesn’t sound too nice to me — when heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them.  Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed, in great danger, and he leapt into action, returning fire and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety, and just barely.  I have some of the prints of that event, and it was not good.\nAgent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and for your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed.  We honor you, and we will always honor you.  Thank you, Roberto, very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Roberto.\nAnd I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border.  He’s a great, great gentleman.\nThe territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture, and exercise total control — they have total control over a whole nation — posing a grave threat to our national security.  The cartels are waging war in America, and it’s time for America to wage war on the cartels, which we are doing.  (Applause.)\nFive nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them — think of this — handed over to us 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country.  That has never happened before.  They want to make us happy.  (Applause.)  First time ever.\nBut we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they’ve done, and they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the USA.  They’re going to stop it.\nI have sent Congress a detailed funding request laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than current record holder, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man but someone who believed very strongly in borders.  Americans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law.\nSo, Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you’re going to be able to do that.  Mr. Speaker, thank you.  Mr. Leader, thank you.  Thank you very much.  And let’s get it to me.  I’ll sign it so fast, you won’t even believe it.  (Applause.)\nAnd as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns.  (Applause.)  In recent years, our justice system has been turned upside down by radical-left lunatics.  Many jurisdictions virtually ceased enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me.\nMy administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law, starting at the FBI and the DOJ.\nPam, good luck.  Kash, wherever you may be, good luck.  (Applause.)  Good luck.  Pam Bondi, good luck.  So important.  Going to do a great job.  (Applause.)\nKash, thank you.  Thank you, Kash.  (Applause.)\nThey have already started very strong.  They’re going to do a fantastic job.  You’re going to be very proud of them.\nWe’re also, once again, giving our police officers the support, protection, and respect they so dearly deserve.  They have to get it.  They have such a hard, dangerous job, but we’re going to make it less dangerous.  The problem is the bad guys don’t respect the law, but they’re starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it.\n(Cross-talk.)\nThis also includes our great fire departments throughout the country.  Our firemen and women are unbelievable people, and I will never forget them.  And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers, so I have no choice.  (Applause.)\nOne year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer Jonathan Diller — unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer — was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island.  I went to his funeral.  The vicious criminal charged with his murder had 21 prior arrests, and they were rough arrests too.  He was a real bad one.\nThe thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests and went by the name of “Killer.”  He was Killer.  He killed other people.  They say a lot of them.\nI attended Officer Diller’s service, and when I met his wife and one-year-old son, Ryan, it was very inspirational, actually.  His widow’s name is Stephanie, and she is here tonight.  Stephanie, thank you very much, Stephanie.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nStephanie, we’re going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero — New York’s Finest.  And we’re going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets, and we’re going to do it fast.  Got to stop it.\nThey get out with 28 arrests.  They push people into subway trains.  They hit people over the back of the head with baseball bats.  We got to get them out of here.\nI’ve already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer.  And, tonight, I’m asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law.  (Applause.)\nI’m also asking for a new crime bill, getting tough on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America’s police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed.  They don’t want to be killed.  We’re not going to let them be killed.\nJoining us in the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police.  His name is D.J. Daniel.  He is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer.  (Applause.)\nBut in 2018, D.J. was diagnosed with brain cancer.  The doctors gave him five months at most to live.  That was more than six years ago.  (Applause.)\nSince that time, D.J. and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true, and D.J. has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer, actually, a number of times.  Pec- — the police love him.  The police departments love him.\nAnd tonight, D.J., we’re going to do you the biggest honor of them all.  I am asking our new Secret Service director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States Secret Service.  (Applause.)\n(Director Curran presents Mr. Daniel with a Secret Service Agent credential.)\nAUDIENCE:  D.J.!  D.J.!  D.J.!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, D.J.\nD.J.’s doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger.  Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40 percent.  Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to make America healthy again, chaired by our new secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.  (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  MAHA, baby!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  With the name “Kennedy,” you would have thought everybody over here would have been cheering.  (Laughter.)  How quickly they forget.\nOur goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong.\nAs an example, not long ago — you can’t even believe these numbers — 1 in 10,000 children had autism. 1 in 10,000.  And now it’s 1 in 36.  There’s something wrong.  One in 36.  Think of that.\nSo, we’re going to find out what it is, and there’s nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you — you have the best — to figure out what is going on.\nOkay, Bobby?  Good luck.  It’s a very important job.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.\nMy administration is also working to protect our children from toxic ideologies in our schools.      A few years ago, January Littlejohn and her husband discovered that their daughter’s school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl.  Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband, while encouraging her daughter to use a new name and pronouns — “they/them” pronouns, actually — all without telling January, who is here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse.  January, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.\nStories like this are why, shortly after taking office, I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology.  (Applause.)\nI also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth.  (Applause.)  And now I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body.  This is a big lie.  (Applause.)\nAnd our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way God made you.  (Applause.)\nBecause we’re getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military, and it’s already out, and it’s out of our society.  We don’t want it.  Wokeness is trouble.  Wokeness is bad.  It’s gone.  It’s gone.  And we feel so much better for it, don’t we?  Don’t we feel better?  (Applause.)       Our service members won’t be activists and ideologues.  They will be fighters and warriors.  They will fight for our country.           And, Pete, congratulations.  Secretary of Defense, congratulations.  (Applause.)     And he’s not big into the woke movement, I can tell you.  (Laughter.)  I know him well.      I am pleased to report that, in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services.  (Applause.)  What a difference.     And you know it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite.  We couldn’t recruit anywhere.  We couldn’t recruit.  Now we’re having the best results, just about, that we’ve ever had.  What a tremendous turnaround.  It’s really a beautiful thing to see.  People love our country again.  It’s very simple.  They love our country, and they love being in our military again.  So, it’s a great thing.  And thank you very much.  Great job.  Thank you.  (Applause.)     We’re joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty.  Jason’s father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all wore the uniform.      Jason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy, when he was just a boy, and now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service.  Jason is a senior in high school, a six-letter varsity athlete — a really good athlete, they say — a brilliant student, with a 4.46 — that’s good — GPA.  (Laughter.)  And his greatest dream is to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.  (Applause.)      And, Jason, that’s a very big deal getting in.  That’s a hard one to get into.  But I’m pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted.  You will soon be joining the Corps of Cadets.  (Applause.)      Thank you.  Jason, you’re going to be on the Long Gray Line, Jason.      As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future.  As a first step, I’m asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland, all made in the USA.  (Applause.)      And Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn’t there, not even close.  But now we have the technology.  It’s incredible, actually.  And other places, they have it: Israel has it.  Other places have it.  And the United States should have it too.  Right, Tim?  Right?  (Applause.)  They should have it too.  So, I want to thank you.      But it’s a very important.  This is a very dangerous world.  We should have it.  We want to be protected.  And we’re going to protect our citizens like never before.     To boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding.  (Applause.)\nAnd for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new Office of Shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs.      We used to make so many ships.  We don’t make them anymore very much, but we’re going to make them very fast, very soon.  It will have a huge impact.          To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it.  (Applause.)     Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.      The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others, but others could use it.  But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure.  Thirty-eight thousand workers died building the Panama Canal.  They died of malaria.  They died of snake bites and mosquitoes.  Not a nice place to work.  They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25 percent chance that they would die.  The most expensive project, also, that was ever built in our country’s history, if you bring it up to modern-day costs.     It was given away by the Carter administration for $1, but that agreement has been violated very severely.  We didn’t give it to China.  We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.  (Applause.)     And we have Marco Rubio in charge.  Good luck, Marco.  (Laughter and applause.)  Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong.  (Laughter.)\nNo, Marco has been amazing, and he’s going to do a great job.  Think of it.  He got a hundred votes.  (Applause.)  You know, he was approved with, actually, 99, but the 100th was this gentleman, and I feel very certain — so, let’s assume he got 100 votes.  And I’m either very, very happy about that or I’m very concerned about it.  (Laughter.)      But he’s already proven — I mean, he’s a great gentleman.  He’s respected by everybody.  And we appreciate you voting for Marco.  He’s going to do a fantastic job.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  He’s doing a great job.  Great job.      And I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland.  (Laughter.)  We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and, if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.      We need Greenland for national security and even international security, and we’re working with everybody involved to try and get it.  But we need it, really, for international world security.  And I think we’re going to get it.  One way or the other, we’re going to get it.\nWe will keep you safe.  We will make you rich.  And together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.       It’s a very small population but very, very large piece of land and very, very important for military security.     America is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism.      Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan — not that they were withdrawing; it was the way they withdrew.  Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.       Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.  (Applause.)     And I want to thank, especially, the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster.      This was a very momentous day for those 13 families, who I actually got to know very well, most of them, whose children were murdered, and the many people that were so badly — over 42 people — so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan.  What a horrible day.  Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, “Wow, maybe this is my chance.”  That’s how bad it was.  Should have never happened.  Grossly incompetent people.      I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones, and they’re all in our hearts tonight.  Just spoke to them on the phone.  We had a big call.  Every one of them called, and everybody was on the line, and they did nothing but cry with happiness.  They were very happy — as happy as you can be under those circumstances.  Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter was killed for no reason whatsoever.      In the Middle East, we’re bringing back our hostages from Gaza.  In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations: the Abraham Accords.  (Applause.)\nAnd now we’re going to build on that foundation to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region.  A lot of things are happening in the Middle East.  People haven’t been talking about that so much lately with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia, but a lot of things are happening in the Middle East.  It’s a rough neighborhood, actually.     I’m also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine.  Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict with no end in sight.      The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine’s defense with no security, with no anything.  (Applause.)     Do you want to keep it going for another five years?      SENATOR WARREN:  Yes!     THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Yeah, you would say — Pocahontas says, “Yes.”  (Laughter.)     AUDIENCE MEMBERS:  Booo —     THE PRESIDENT:  Two thousand people are being killed every single week — more than that.  They’re Russian young people.  They’re Ukrainian young people.  They’re not Americans.  But I want it to stop.     Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine, by far.  Think of that.  They’ve spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending.  And we’ve spent, perhaps, $350 billion.  Like taking candy from a baby, that’s what happened.  And they’ve spent $100 billion.  What a difference that is.  And we have an ocean separating us, and they don’t.      But we’re getting along very well with them, and lots of good things are happening.      Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars.  It’s hard to believe that they wouldn’t have stopped it and said, at some point, “Come on.  Let’s equalize.  You got to be equal to us.”  But that didn’t happen.     Earlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelenskyy of Ukraine.  The letter reads, “Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer.”  “Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,” he said.  (Applause.)  “My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.  We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence.  Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you.”      I appreciate that he sent this letter.  Just got it a little while ago.       Simultaneously, we’ve had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace.  Wouldn’t that be beautiful?  Wouldn’t that be beautiful?  (Applause.)  Wouldn’t that be beautiful?     It’s time to stop this madness.  It’s time to halt the killing.  It’s time to end this senseless war.  If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides.      Nearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Marc Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years in a penal colony.  Rough stuff.      The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him.  They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin.  But last summer, I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, that we would bring her boy safely back home.          After 22 days in office, I did just that, and they are here tonight.  (Applause.)      To Marc and his great mom, we are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us.      As fate would have it, Marc Fogel was born in a small, rural town — in Butler, Pennsylvania — have you heard of it? — where his mother has lived for the past 78 years.     I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally. That was not pleasant.  (Laughter.)  And that is where I met his beautiful mom, right before I walked onto that stage.  And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son.  And I never did, did I?  Never forgot.       Less than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out, and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper’s perch into a crowd of many thousands of people.           My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky.  Corey Comperatore was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and, above all, a protector.      When the sound of gunshots pierced the air — it was a horrible sound — Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do.  He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body.     Corey was hit really hard.  You know the story from there.  He sacrificed his life to save theirs.      Two others — very fine people — were also seriously hit.  But thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors, we thought they were gone, and they were saved.  So, those doctors had great talent.      We’re joined by Corey’s wife, Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allyson and Kaylee.  Thank you.  (Applause.)     To Helen, Allyson, and Kaylee, Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now, and he is cheering you on.  He loves you.  He is cheering you on.      Corey was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot.  It was love like Corey’s that built our country, and it’s love like Corey’s that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before.       I believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason.  I was saved by God to make America great again.  I believe that.  (Applause.)  Thank you.      Thank you.  Thank you very much.       From the patriots of Lexington and Concord to the heroes of Gettysburg and Normandy, from the warriors who crossed the Delaware to the trailblazers who climbed the Rockies, and from the legends who soared at Kitty Hawk to the astronauts who touched the Moon, Americans have always been the people who defied all odds, transcended all dangers, made the most extraordinary sacrifices, and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country, and our freedom.     And as we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love, and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people.  Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign, and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it till death.      We will never let anything happen to our beloved country, because we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters, and survivors.      Our ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness, and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier.  They chased our destiny across a boundless continent.  They built the railroads, laid the highways, and graced the world with American marvels, like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam, and the towering Golden Gate Bridge.      They lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, vanquished the communists, fascists, and Marxists all over the world, and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass, and steel.       We stand on the shoulders of these pioneers who won and built the modern age, these workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities, these warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.       Now it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty, and it is our turn to take America’s destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country.      This will be our greatest era.       With God’s help, over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher, and we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic, and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this Earth.      We are going to create the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world.      We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science, and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond.  (Applause.)     And, through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit, and we are going to renew unlimited promise of the American dream.      Every single day, we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.     AUDIENCE MEMBERS:  Fight!  Fight!  Fight!     THE PRESIDENT:  My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future, because the golden age of America has only just begun.  It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before.      Thank you.  God bless you.  And God bless America.  (Applause.)     Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.\nThank you very much.  Appreciate it.\nThank you very much.                             END                11:00 P.M.

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2025 as Irish-American Heritage Month.  I call upon all Americans to celebrate the achievements of Irish Americans and their contributions to our Nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.                                DONALD J.

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2025 as Women’s History Month.  I call on all Americans to celebrate the exceptional women in their lives and around our country.     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand thissixth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.                              DONALD J.

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Purpose. The dishonest and dangerous activity of the law firm Perkins Coie LLP (“Perkins Coie”) has affected this country for decades. Notably, in 2016 while representing failed Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Perkins Coie hired Fusion GPS, which then manufactured a false “dossier” designed to steal an election. This egregious activity is part of a pattern. Perkins Coie has worked with activist donors including George Soros to judicially overturn popular, necessary, and democratically enacted election laws, including those requiring voter identification. In one such case, a court was forced to sanction Perkins Coie attorneys for an unethical lack of candor before the court.\nIn addition to undermining democratic elections, the integrity of our courts, and honest law enforcement, Perkins Coie racially discriminates against its own attorneys and staff, and against applicants. Perkins Coie publicly announced percentage quotas in 2019 for hiring and promotion on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws. It proudly excluded applicants on the basis of race for its fellowships, and it maintained these discriminatory practices until applicants harmed by them finally sued to enforce change.\nMy Administration is committed to ending discrimination under “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant race-based and sex-based discrimination, including quotas, but purposefully hide the nature of such discrimination through deceiving language, have engaged in a serious violation of the public trust. Their disrespect for the bedrock principle of equality represents good cause to conclude that they neither have access to our Nation’s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds.\nSec. 2. Security Clearance Review. (a) The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Perkins Coie, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.\n(b) The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Perkins Coie. The heads of all agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision.\nSec. 3. Contracting. (a) To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, racial discrimination, falsified documents designed to weaponize the Government against candidates for office, and anti-democratic election changes that invite fraud and distrust, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Perkins Coie and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract.\n(b) The heads of all agencies shall review all contracts with Perkins Coie or with entities that disclose doing business with Perkins Coie under subsection (a) of this section. To the extent permitted by law, the heads of agencies shall:\n(i) take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, for which Perkins Coie has been hired to perform any service;\n(ii) otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate. Within 30 days of the date of this order, all agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with Perkins Coie or with entities that do business with Perkins Coie effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order.\nSec. 4. Racial Discrimination. (a) The Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall review the practices of representative large, influential, or industry leading law firms for consistency with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, including whether large law firms: reserve certain positions, such as summer associate spots, for individuals of preferred races; promote individuals on a discriminatory basis; permit client access on a discriminatory basis; or provide access to events, trainings, or travel on a discriminatory basis.\n(b) The Attorney General, in coordination with the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and in consultation with State Attorneys General as appropriate, shall investigate the practices of large law firms as described in subsection (a) of this section who do business with Federal entities for compliance with race-based and sex-based non-discrimination laws and take any additional actions the Attorney General deems appropriate in light of the evidence uncovered.\nSec. 5. Personnel. (a) The heads of all agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Perkins Coie when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States. In addition, the heads of all agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Perkins Coie employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States.\n(b) Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of Perkins Coie, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States.\nSec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,March 6, 2025."

Upon taking office, President Trump immediately blocked these proposed rules and has initiated an aggressive deregulatory agenda that requires substantial cuts in existing regulations for each new agency rule. President Trump is committed to cutting senseless red tape that will lower costs, lead to higher growth, and usher America into its Golden Age.\n- Since returning to office, President Trump has saved Americans over $180 billion, or $2,100 per family of four, by halting proposed Biden-era regulations.\n- The Biden Administration added more than $1.8 trillion, or $21,090 per family of four, in new regulatory costs, far surpassing any other administration on record.\n- 72% of these new regulatory burdens ($1.3 trillion or $15,457 per family of four) were the result of new EPA rules.\n- Rolling back just automobile-related rules will save consumers over $1.134 trillion.\n- In 2024, the Biden Administration set an all-time record by publishing 107,262 pages of final rules, proposed rules, and other public notices in the Federal Register.\n- This stands in stark contrast to President Trump, who recently announced a bold deregulation initiative that requires the elimination of ten existing rules or guidance documents for every new regulation.\nDetails\n- Notable regulatory actions by President Trump via executive order include:\n\nHalting the creation of new regulations, with a projected cost of $180 billion.\n\n\n\nThe creation of a new 1-in-10-out regulatory budget.\n\n\n\nAbolishing DEI across agencies.\n\n\n\nBoosting domestic energy production though eased access to energy resources and improved infrastructure.\n- Halting the creation of new regulations, with a projected cost of $180 billion.\n- The creation of a new 1-in-10-out regulatory budget.\n- Abolishing DEI across agencies.\n- Boosting domestic energy production though eased access to energy resources and improved infrastructure.\n- Among finalized Biden EPA rules, the following edicts were the most expensive:\n\n$870 billion: Mandated reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and a 50% reduction in other pollutant emissions from light-duty and medium-duty vehicles for model years 2027 and beyond.\n\n\n\n$180 billion: Mandated reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in passenger cars and light trucks for model years 2023 and beyond.\n\n\n\n$106.19 billion: Unnecessary water

    "content": "America Is Back. President’s Joint Address Will Celebrate ItU.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL)\nThe last four years were a dumpster fire—a total disaster. “Sleepy Joe” was worn slap out as soon as he got up in the morning. Thinking back on it now, I really don’t know how our country survived. It’s a miracle that we made it through those dark days. One thing is for sure: President Trump’s address will be nothing like the clown show we endured the last four years.But today, America is ready to usher in its golden age under President Donald J. Trump. We’re only a month and a half in, and President Trump is well on his way to renewing the American dream by reversing some of the Democrats’ most destructive policies. Most importantly, President Trump is keeping his promises to the 77 million Americans who voted for him and his “America First” agenda. A recent poll showed 70 percent of Americans believe President Trump is doing what he said he would do.\nRead full op-ed here.\nIt’s Time To Take Trump’s Win On Women’s Sports To The Next LevelU.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS)\nDemocrat politicians and extreme woke ideologues have shrugged their shoulders at the humiliation and disenfranchisement of millions of young women and girls, even though 80% of Americans agree with President Trump’s view that biological boys should not compete in girls’ sports.\nI believe America’s women and girls deserve to know that someone is fighting to protect the integrity and fairness of their competitive sports and standing up for their right to safe and protected spaces like bathrooms and locker rooms.\nThankfully, President Trump has taken up the mantle. Last month, he signed an executive order protecting women’s and girls’ sports.Read full op-ed here.Renewing the American Dream for the American WorkerU.S. Senator Jim Banks (R-IN)\nPresident Trump is renewing the hope of the American Dream from the ashes of an historic low point. Our nation has emerged stronger with a leader and an administration whose defining feature is their commitment to working families.\nDespite the downturn in prosperity and security America faced over the last four years, the American Dream is not an outdated ambition.\nUnder President Trump, the possibility of achieving the American Dream is back and within the grasp of every hard-working American.Already, President Trump has made good on a range of his promises, reinvigorating American society across the board—an achievement that’s unheard of for a president only 44 days into his term.\nRead full op-ed here.\nPresident Donald Trump is keeping his promise to Jewish studentsHouse Committee on Education and Workforce Chairman, U.S. Congressman Tim Walberg (MI-05)Columbia [University] leaders have made public and private promises to Jewish students, faculty, and Members of Congress that the university would take the steps necessary to combat the rampant antisemitism on its campus. Columbia has failed to uphold its commitments. But that is coming to an end. Now, the Committee and Jewish students and faculty have a strong ally in the White House. During the campaign Trump promised his administration would combat antisemitism on American campuses.\nOn day one, the Trump administration signed an executive order to combat antisemitism. As part of the executive order, the Department of Education has launched investigations into five universities for tolerating “widespread antisemitic harassment” in violation of Title VI.\nThe disease of antisemitism must be rooted out before it spreads to the next generation. President Trump’s firm hand on this issue is the remedy we need. We owe it to our youth to ensure they never face harassment, threats, or violence because of their faith. This is a promise we should always honor because it goes hand in hand with the promise of the American Dream. Thankfully, President Trump is delivering on this promise.\nRead full op-ed here.\nAmerica is backU.S. Congressman Richard Hudson (NC-09)Since his inauguration on Jan. 20, President Donald J. Trump has worked tirelessly to restore border security, enforce our nation’s laws and make clear that your constitutional rights shall not be infringed. Following four years of chaos, Trump has sent a clear message: America is back, and he’s just getting started.\nAfter just one month back in office, Trump reestablished the successful “Remain in Mexico” policy, restarted construction of the border wall, ramped up deportation flights of criminal illegals, and ended the dangerous Biden-era “catch-and-release” policy. These are just a few of the actions Trump has taken to regain control of our border and crack down on illegal immigration.\nTrump’s efforts to secure the border have been nothing less than historic, including sharply reducing illegal border crossings in just his first 11 days back in office. This is the “Trump Effect” in action, and it’s only just the beginning.\nRead full op-ed here.\nUnder President Trump, America’s Borders Are Secure AgainU.S. Congressman Andy Biggs (AZ-05)\nIn a few weeks, Donald Trump has done what his prevaricating predecessor declared to be impossible: he has brought the border under control.\nThe policies of Joe Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas will forever be a stain on America. The border is now almost completely controlled by America, not Mexican drug and human trafficking cartels. That only has happened because President Trump has the will and leadership skills to allow our law enforcement to actually enforce the law. Trump said he would do it. He is doing it.\nAmerica is safer now. Our borders are better now. Trump is delivering on one of his signature campaign promises. While the Left in America is face-melting, the majority of us recognize the success on the border of President Trump.\nRead full op-ed here.\nTrump Gives America A Much-Needed Shot Of OptimismU.S. Congressman Ralph Norman (SC-05)\nWe’re now 44 days into President Donald Trump’s second term, and a renewed sense of optimism is sweeping across America, reminiscent of the enduring promise of the American Dream. Central to this resurgence is the administration’s policies aimed at reigniting prosperity for small businesses, particularly evident in South Carolina’s 5th Congressional District.\nPresident Trump has been keen on drawing back the red tape in the federal bureaucracy and reminding everyone in the swamp that our government is supposed to serve the American worker, not the other way around.\nLast night the president made it clear: ‘We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in 4 years…and we are just getting started!’\nRead full op-ed here.\nTrump is Reviving the American Dream and Common SenseU.S. Congresswoman Diana Harshbarger (TN-01)\nTuesday night, President Donald Trump did what he does best — he told it like it is. He reviewed his administration’s impressive accomplishments, laid out his action plan to put our economy back on track, urged Congress to deliver additional funding for the United States Border Patrol, and shared his bold vision to bring peace and stability around the world.\nOnly weeks ago, the president signed an executive order keeping men out of women’s sports. I attended the signing, and it was a sight to see — the president with dozens of female athletes and young women who would now have a level playing field because of Republicans’ commitment to this cause — Trump’s commitment to this cause.\nThe president reiterated this commitment Tuesday night when he spoke on this issue, highlighting the story of Payton McNabb, saying, “When her girls’ volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton’s face, causing traumatic brain injury … ending her athletic career.This story has become all too common. When Trump told Payton’s story, not a single Democrat stood in solidarity.Read full op-ed here.\nEnding Biden’s disgraceful erosion of American deterrence U.S. Congressman August Pfluger (TX-01) andU.S. Congressman Zach Nunn (IA-03)\nWith Trump back in the White House, alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and national security adviser Mike Waltz, we’re setting a clear path forward for the U.S.: rebuild the military, restore our warrior ethos, and reestablish American deterrence.\nUnlike his predecessors, who viewed the military through the lens of social experimentation, Hegseth recognizes that the Department of Defense has one primary mission: to produce the most lethal fighting force on Earth. Under his leadership, we’re already seeing a renewed focus on combat training, eliminating wasteful programs, and stripping away ideological distractions.\nRead full op-ed here.\nCongress Must Act to Solidify Trump’s Border WinsU.S. Congressman Mark Harris (NC-08)\nFor the past four years, the most powerful nation in the history of the world has been under attack. Deadly cartels, gangs, human smugglers, and other criminal aliens flooded American communities and harmed our citizens. This chaos was an orchestrated attack led by the last administration not only on our nation, but on the American dream.\nBut on January 20th, a new era of leadership began. After being sworn into office, President Trump wasted no time taking action to take back our country and set our nation back on course.\nLast night, President Trump said, “The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation to secure the border. But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president.” And he is exactly right.\nPresident Trump’s decisive action and bold leadership has drastically changed the state of our border for the better.\nRead full op-ed here."

    "content": "Today our Nation commemorates the 255th anniversary of the Boston Massacre—the singular event that ignited the movement for American independence.  To this day, it stands as a defining crucible of the American Revolution.\nThe years leading up to this tragic moment were marked by escalating tensions between the Patriots and the British Parliament.  The imposition of unjust global trade regimes and burdensome taxes, including the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts, inspired the American Colonies in their bid for Freedom.\nOn the wintry evening of March 5, 1770, a fight broke out in the city of Boston, Massachusetts, between the British Redcoats and unarmed American Colonists.  The violence escalated as the soldiers fired their muskets into the crowd at the Custom House.  When the smoke cleared on King Street, three civilians were dead, two fatally wounded, and six more injured.\nThis massacre sparked outrage among the Colonists.  It has echoed throughout history as a seminal moment in the long and fraught battle for American liberty.  Roughly five years later, the first shots were fired in Revolutionary War—and the American Colonists ultimately secured their independence, paving the way for the birth of the greatest Nation in the history of the world. On this, the 255th Anniversary of the Boston Massacre, we pay tribute to and honor those who have paid the ultimate price in defense of America’s cherished values."

This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!”\n- During his first term as President of the United States, President Trump established the President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and declared the Opioid Crisis a public health emergency.\n- President Trump also has a long record of putting America first on trade. In his first term, President Trump successfully used threats of tariffs on Mexico to help secure our border.\n- When our national security was threatened by a global oversupply of steel and aluminum, President Trump took swift action to protect America’s national security by implementing tariffs on imports of these goods."

    "content": "Roosevelt Room\n2:38 P.M. EST     THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Thank you very much.\nThank you very much.  This is a very big day for a lot of reasons, but this gentleman is a very unique man.  I think I can say, in the world of chips, certainly, but in the world pretty much of business, nobody has done what he’s done.  For those of you that are into that world, you would say, “Wow, he’s a legend.”  But he is a legend.  And it’s an honor to be with you.  Very great honor.  Thank you very much.\nMR. WEI:  Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.\nWelcoming, from TSMC — which is the biggest there is, at a level that you can’t even calculate, frankly — C.C. Wei, to the White House for a very historic announcement.  This is a tremendous thing for our country and, hopefully, for his company.\nWe’re also pleased to be joined by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and White House AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, another two very highly respected people.  It’s great to have you guys involved.  And, David, thank you very much for coming on.\nDavid is sort of the king of intellect in that world.  We have some good people.     Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion dollars in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities.  I think, mostly, it’s going to be in Arizona, which is what I understand, which is a great state.  I like it because I won it.  But I won most of them — (laughs) — actually.  So — but I did.  We won it, and we won it big.\nThe most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America, and it’ll be a big percentage of the chips made by his company.  But, as you know, they’re based mostly in Taiwan.  And they’re far and away the biggest.  There’s nobody even close.\nThis $100 billion in new investment will go into building five cutting-edge fabrication facilities in the great state that we just discussed, Arizona, and will create thousands of jobs — many thousands of jobs, and they’re high-paying jobs.     In total, today’s announcement brings Taiwan Semiconductor investments to about $165 billion — they’ve started already — among the largest new foreign direct investments in United States.\nApple, as you know, made a big announcement last week of $500 billion, and we have some others that have announced.      We have many that want to announce.  But I don’t have time to do all of these announcements, I tell you.  But, for you, I’m doing the announcement.\nMR. WEI:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  This will create hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity and boost America’s dominance in artificial intelligence and beyond.\nSemiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy — and, really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy — powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.  And we must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here, in American factories, with American skill and American labor.  And that’s exactly what we’re doing.\nAs you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.  And I think “pretty much” is not a term that’s even appropriate.  They do have a monopoly.  And this is a tremendous move by the most powerful company in the world.\nIt’s a matter of economic security.  It’s also a matter of national security for us.  And, at the same time, Mr. Wei will be able to diversify and have his tremendous presence in another place and a very safe place.  And I want to thank Taiwan Semiconductor for doing the announcement.\nAnd I’d like to ask Mr. Wei to say a few words, if you might.\nAnd I’d also like to ask Howard and David — you can say a couple of words.  But maybe you should go first because, right now, he’s the most important man in the room.  I’m sorry, fellas.\nPlease.\nThank you very much.  Thank you.  Great honor.\nMR. WEI:  Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nMR. WEI:  I’m a — I’m a little bit nervous, so I have to pull out my piece of paper.\nMr. President, Secretary Lutnick — and, David, I didn’t know that — your title, but — okay.\nFirst, I want to thank — say thank you to Mr. President to give me this opportunity to announce our big project in the U.S. TSMC is the world’s largest chip manufacturing, founded by Dr. Morris Chang in 1987.  It’s now at the forefront of semiconductor technology, supporting AI advancement and industry growth.\nIn fact, I would like to wind back the time that in 2020 we have to thank President Trump’s vision and his support.  So, TSMC start the journey of establishing the advanced chip manufacturing in Arizona.  And now, let me proudly say, now the vision become reality.\nIn Phoenix, Arizona, with 3,000 employees, we are producing the most advanced chip made on U.S. soil with the success of our first fab.\nSo, we are now very happy to announce we are going to invest additional 100 billion U.S. dollar in addition to our current 65-billion-U.S.-dollars investment in Arizona.  We are going to build three more new fab — be- — after we promised the three fabs already, and another two very advanced packaging fab, and, most important, an R&D center, also in Arizona.\nFor this, all the investment — $165 billion — is going to create thousand of the high-paid job, as the president just announced.  And we are, most important — actually, we are going to produce many AI chips.  We are going to produce many chips to support AI’s progress and to support the smartphone’s progress. And, again, with that, I want to thank President Trump again for his support.  In addition, I also want to thank my customers in the U.S., such as Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom.  They all support TSMC’s manufacturing in the U.S.  Without their support, we probably cannot make it true. So, again, I want to thank them.  Also, I’d like to thank the TSMC’s employee.  Without their effort, we just cannot make it today. That’s all I want to say.  And thank you. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That’s great.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much. Howard, please.  David.SECRETARY LUTNICK:  Sure.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. SECRETARY LUTNICK:  So, I’m thrilled to be here today, because President Trump has made it a fundamental objective to bring semiconductor chip manufacturing home to America. Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion.  So, America gave TSMC 10 percent of the money to build here.  And now you’re seeing the power of Donald Trump’s presidency, because TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with $100 billion investment.  And, of course, that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs. So, the idea is: Come to America.  Build greatness in America.  Build for the American customers — the Apple, Nvidia, that whole list that Chairman Wei gave — in order to bring production to America. So, we’re really, really excited.  This continues the most incredible path you’ve ever seen, in these first weeks and months of the Trump administration, of incredible manufacturing coming to America.  The keys that the president has called out are coming here.  They’re coming here in huge size because they want to be in the greatest market in the world, and they want to avoid the tariffs that, if they’re not here, they’d have to suffer. So, I want to congratulate C.C. Wei for bringing in this incredible $100 billion investment, but it’s on the shoulders of our president, Donald Trump, which is why he’s coming. So, thank you.  THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.David.  MR. SACKS:  Thank you, sir.  Well, the products that TSMC makes are literally the most important products in the world.  I mean, these advanced chips power everything.  They power AI.  They power your phone.  They power your cars.  And without them, the whole modern economy would stop, but they’re not made in the United States. So, for TSMC to move here is a huge, huge development, and we owe that to President Trump’s leadership on the economy and Secretary Lutnick as well.  And, C.C., thank you for — for coming here. Thank you.  Yeah.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, David. So, thank you very much.  A big percentage of chips with this investment will be made now — a big percentage.  Worldwide, we had very little.  Almost none.  We used to have a lot with Intel.  But we had very little.  And we’ll be at close to 40 percent of the market with this transaction and a couple of others that we’re doing.  That’s a tremendous leap — like, a leap that nobody would have really said was possible. So, I just want to thank you all for being here.  If you want a couple of questions.(Cross-talk.)Q    On the — THE PRESIDENT:  Ideally on this subject. Yes, please. Q    — specific number of jobs it will create.   He said thousands —THE PRESIDENT:  They — yeah.Q    — but do you have a better —THE PRESIDENT:  They — you’re probably talking about 25,000 jobs.  But it’ll get bigger and bigger with time.  Knowing this gentleman, it’ll get bigger and bigger.  There’ll be no stopping him.  (Laughs.)Q    Mr. President, what more —THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Brian, go ahead.Q    Right.  In addition to the jobs, you talked about national security, and that’s one thing I think a lot of Americans —THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah. Q    — at home don’t understand.  Explain the national security aspect of this. THE PRESIDENT:  Well, without the chips and semiconductors, nothing runs today.  You can’t buy a car without them.  You can’t get a radio, a television, nothing — you can’t get anything.  And we thought it was very important — obviously, business was, but we thought even to terms of national security, to have this large percentage of the chips, semiconductors, and other things that they make — the most important product, and not a product that you can really copy.  It takes years and years.  You’re on the needle of a pin is total genius.  I mean, they can put things — I mean, something the size of the needle, the point of a pin, they put information that is just not even believable. So, if you would — (Cross-talk.) If you would see this, it’s just really something. Yes, Brian. Q    Can I — one — one more aspect to that.  Honda —THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah. Q    — announced they’re coming to Indiana because of the tariffs.  Once again —THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.Q    — you’re bringing additional jobs in manufacturing.  Do you want to comment on that as well?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Honda is coming, and I told you about Apple, that they’re going to be starting to build massively here — $500 billion.  And we have many other companies.  It’s going to be announced, but we had many that have already announced.  And no, it’s going to be great.  It’s looking — it’s looking really strong.  I don’t think this country has ever seen anything like we’re seeing right now. Now, the tariffs, as you know, it will start a week earlier than the reciprocal, which is going to be on — a couple of weeks earlier.  Reciprocal tariffs start on April 2nd.  And I wanted to make it April 1st, but I didn’t want to do — I didn’t want to go April Fool’s Day — (laughter) — because that cost me — that costs a lot of money, but — that one day.  So, we’re going April 2nd.But very importantly, tomorrow, tariffs — 25 percent on Canada and 25 percent on Mexico, and that’ll start.  So, they’re going to have to have a tariff.  So, what they’ll have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States — in which case, they have no tariffs.  In other words, you build — and this is exactly what Mr. Wei is doing by building here.  Otherwise, they’ll build — if they did them in Taiwan to send them here, they’ll have 25 percent or 30 percent or 50 percent or whatever the number may be someday.  It’ll go only up.  But by doing it here, he has no tariffs, so he’s way ahead of the game. And I would just say this to people in Canada or Mexico, if they’re going to build car plants, the people that are doing them are much better off building here, because we have the market.  We’re the market where they sell the most.  And so, I think it’s going to be very exciting.  Very exciting for the automobile companies.  Very exciting for — I can think of any — as an example, North Carolina, they had the great — I used to go there to buy furniture for hotels, and it’s been wiped out.  That business all went to other countries, and now it’s all going to come back into North Carolina — the furniture manufacturing business.Please.  Q    Mr. President —Q    Is the Ukraine minerals deal now dead, or can it be revived?  What — what’s your —THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’ll let you know.  We’re making a speech — you probably heard about it — tomorrow night, so I’ll let you know tomorrow night. But, no, I don’t think so.  I think it’s — look, it’s a great deal for us, because, you know, Biden very, very, foolishly — stupidly, frankly — gave $300 billion and — $350 billion, more accurately — to a country to fight and to try and do things.  And you know what happened?  We get nothing.  We get nothing — just gave it. We could have rebuilt our entire U.S. Navy with $350 billion.  Think of it.  Three hundred and fifty billion, we could have rebuilt our U.S. Navy.So, he gave it away as fast as the money could be gone.  And what we’re doing is getting that all back and a lot more than that.  And what we need — it’s very important for this business that we’re talking about here, with chips and semiconductors and everything else — we need rare earths.  And the deal we have is we have the finest rare earths that you can. Q    Sir, on Ukraine.  Sir, on Ukraine.\nQ    Are you going to press back —Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  What do you need to see from President Zelenskyy to restart these negotiations?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I just think he should be more appreciative, because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin.  We’ve given them much more than Europe, and Europe should have given more than us, because, as you know, that’s right there.  That’s the border. This country really was like the fence on the border.  It was very important to Europe.  And I’m not knocking Europe, I’m saying they’re just — they were a lot smarter than Joe Biden, because Joe Biden didn’t have a clue.  He just gave money hand over a fist, and they should have been able to equalize with us. In other words, if we gave a dollar, they should have given.  Well, we gave $350 billion.  They probably gave 100, but on top of it all, they get their money back, because they are doing it in the form of a loan, and it’s a secured loan.  So, when I saw that, which I’ve known about for a little while, I said, “It’s time for us to be smart.”  At the same time, it’s great for them, because they get us in the country taking the rare earth, which is going to fuel this big engine, and especially the engine that we’ve, in a very short time, created.  And we get something, and we’re in the — we’re there.  We have a presence there. With all of that being said, I want one thing to happen: I want all of those young people to stop being killed.  They’re being killed by the thousands every single week.  Last week, 2,700 were killed.  Twenty-seven hundred young — in this case, just about, all young boys from Ukraine and from Russia.  And that’s not young people from the United States, but it’s on a human basis. I want to see it stop.  The money is one thing, but the death.  And they’re losing thousands of soldiers a week, and that’s not including the people that get killed every time a town goes down or a missile goes into a town.(Cross-talk.)We — and — and I want to see it stop. Yes.  Q    Mr. President, are you considering canceling military aid to Ukraine?  And can we get a reaction to what the Kremlin just said, that your administration is bringing U.S. worldview in alignment with Moscow’s?  THE PRESIDENT:  So, this is a deal that should have never happened.  This is a deal that would have never happened, and it didn’t happen — for four years, it didn’t happen.  It was never even close to happening.  If I were president, would not have happened.  And October 7th would have — would not have happened in Israel.  And inflation wouldn’t have happened. And Afghanistan, disastrous — the way they withdrew — not the fact that they withdrew but the way they withdrew — would have never happened.  And we would have had Bagram right now instead of China having it.  It was one hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons.  We would have kept Bagram — one of the biggest air bases in the world. All of these things happened, and it’s a shame.  But it is what it is, and now we’re here.  I want to see it end fast.  I don’t want to see this go on for years and years.Now, President Zelenskyy supposedly made a statement today in AP — I’m not a big fan of AP, so maybe it was an incorrect statement — but he said he thinks the war is going to go on for a long time, and he better not be right about that.  That’s all I’ll say.Q    Mr. President, is there any —\nQ    Could this project — could this minimize the impact of the U.S. with chips should China decide to isolate Taiwan or China decide to take Taiwan? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it’s a very interesting point.  It’s a great question, actually.  But this would certainly — I can’t say “minimize.”  That would be a catastrophic event, obviously.  But it will at least give us a position where we have — in this very, very important business, we would have a very big part of it in the United States.  So, it would have a big impact if something should happen with Taiwan.Q    And with Russia sanctions, are you looking at relieving Russian sanctions if there is a peace deal?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re going to make deals with everybody to get this war, including Europe and European nations.  And they’ve acted very well.  You know, they’re good people.  I know; most of them are friends of mine — the heads of state, the heads of the various countries, prime ministers from the different — I got four prime ministers and five presidents called me over the last two days, and they want to work it out.  They want to get it worked out.  And I think they’re also — you know, they’re talking money, but the money is less important than the deaths.  We’re talking thousands of young people a week.  And people would say why do I care about Ukraine, young people; why do I care about — and not all young, but they’re pretty young.  You know, Ukraine is running a little bit low, and they’re getting older.  They’re recruiting older people.  It’s a very, very sad thing that’s happening over there, and we want to get it finished.  We want to stop the death. (Cross-talk.)Q    Mr. President, on the tariffs.  Is there any room left for Canada and Mexico to make a deal before midnight?  And should we expect those Chinese tariffs, the extra 10 percent to take effect tomorrow?THE PRESIDENT:  No room left for Mexico or for Canada.  No, the tariffs, you know, they’re all set.  They go into effect tomorrow.Q    Mr. President, just a follow-up on my colleague’s question.  Hearing —THE PRESIDENT:  And just so you understand, vast amounts of fentanyl have poured into our country from Mexico and, as you know, also from China, where it goes to Mexico and goes to Canada.  And China also had an additional 10, so it’s 10 plus 10.  And it comes in from Canada, and it comes in from Mexico, and that’s a very important thing to say.Yeah, please.  Go ahead.Q    Have you decided if you’re going to suspend military aid to Ukraine?  Have you made that decision?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I haven’t even talked about that right now.  I mean, right now, we’ll see what happens.  A lot of things are happening right now, as we speak — I mean, literally as we speak.  I could give you an answer and go back to my office — the beautiful Oval Office.  I could go back into the Oval Office and find out that the answer is obsolete.     It’s like his business.  It’s obsolete.  You come up with a new chip, and it’s obsolete about two minutes later, right?  But that’s what’s good about his business.  That’s why he’s the only one that’s successful in it.  But —      Q    And on tariffs, sir.     Q    Mr. President, just to follow up my colleague’s question from Russia is saying that your foreign policy is largely in line with their vision.  Should that be concerning to Americans? THE PRESIDENT:  Said what?Q    Should that be concerning to Americans?THE PRESIDENT:  Read the statement.Q    That Russia — Russia says that your administration’s foreign policy is, quote, “largely in line” with their vision.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I tell you what, I think it takes two to tango, and you’re going to have to make a deal with Russia, and you’re going to have to make a deal with Ukraine.  You’re going to have to have the ascent, and you’re going to have to have the consent from the European nations, because I think that’s important, and from us. I think everybody has to get into a room, so to speak, and we have to make a deal.  And the deal could be made very fast.  It should not be that hard a deal to make.  It could be made very fast. Now, maybe somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, and if somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, I think that person won’t be around very long.  That person will not be listened to very long.  Because I believe that Russia wants to make a deal.  I believe, certainly, the people of Ukraine want to make a deal.  They’ve suffered more than anybody else.  We talk about suffering — they’ve suffered.But if you think about it, under President Bush, they got Georgia, right?  Russia got Georgia.  Under President Obama, they got a nice, big submarine base, a nice big chunk of land where they have their submarines.  You know that, right?  Crimea.  Under President Trump, they got nothing.  And under President O-Biden, they tried to get the whole thing.  They tried to get the whole big Ukraine, the whole thing.  If I didn’t get in here, they would’ve gotten the whole thing.  So, I can only say — you can go back to Bush, you go back to Obama, and go back to Biden — they took a lot.  The only one they didn’t get — you know what I gave them?  I gave them anti-tank missiles.  That’s what I gave them.  I gave them sanctions on Russia — on Russia.  I gave them Javelins.  You know the Javelins?  You know when they took out all those tanks?You know, the tanks were heading to Kyiv by the hundreds, and they were unstoppable, and I gave them Javelins. So, you know, I really — Putin is the one that will tell you this has not been so good for them.  The fact is that I just want fairness.  I want fairness. But think of it.  I gave Russia nothing except grief.  I gave them nothing.  I gave them sanctions and Javelins.  That’s what I gave them. Obama gave them sheets.  And you heard that statement before.  It’s a very famous — Trump gave them Javelins, and Obama gave them sheets.  And then they say how close I am to Russia. Let me tell you, we have to make a deal, because there are a lot of people being killed that shouldn’t be killed.  But remember, Trump gave them nothing, and the other presidents gave them a lot.  They gave them everything.Q    Mr. President, on trade.  You met with president — Argentine President Javier Milei at CPAC.  He wants to sign a free trade agreement —THE PRESIDENT:  Right. Q    — with the United States.  Is that something that you would consider, even with Argentina, or any other country?THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll consider anything.  And Argentina — I think he’s great, by the way.  I think he’s a great leader.  He’s doing a great job.  He’s doing a fantastic job.  Brought it back from oblivion. Yeah, we’ll look at things.  We’re looking at the UK with things.  It doesn’t have to be tariffs.  But tariffs are easy, they’re fast, they’re efficient, and they bring fairness. For instance, when people kill their dollar, their equivalent of the dollar, whatever — whether it’s the yuan or the yen in Japan or the yuan in China — when they drop them down, that gives us — that puts us at a very unfair disadvantage.  So, all I have to do is say, “Howard, we’re going to have to raise the tariffs a little bit.”Because I’ve called President Xi, I’ve called the leaders of Japan to say, “You can’t continue to reduce and break down your currency.  You can’t do it, because it’s unfair to us.”  It’s very hard for us to make tractors — Caterpillar — here, when Japan, China, and other places are killing their currency, meaning driving it down. So, all of these things add up, and the way you solve it very easily is with tariffs.  Because when they do that, instead of having to make phone calls every day, like I used to do with certain leaders — President Xi, a little bit — a lot of phone calls talking about the fact that they’re lowering their yuan.  They’re lowering it down.  And that makes it very, very hard for us. So, this way, I just say, “Look, let them do that, and we make up for it with the tariffs.”  But —Q    Will you be speaking with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum about tariffs today? THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, sure, I will.  I have a lot of respect for her.  I have a lot of respect for her. (Cross-talk.) Q    After the 10 percent tariff take ef- —THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah. Q    — takes effect, it’ll be 20 percent on China now.  How high are you willing to go against China?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I can’t say.  It depends on what they do with their currency.  It depends on what they do in terms of a retaliation with some kind of an economic retaliation, which I don’t think they’re going to retaliate too much.  Hey, look, the United States has been taken advantage of for 40 years.  The United States has been a laughing stock for years and years.  That’s why this gentleman has built in Taiwan, instead of building here.  It would have been better if he built here.  If we had a president that knew what they were doing — and we had a lot of them very bad on trade.  Look, I’m a huge fan of Ronald Reagan, but he was bad on trade.  Very bad on trade.  He allowed a lot of people, a lot of businesses, to be taken.  So, I say that with due respect, because I — he was so great on other things, but he was bad on trade. We are setting records right now — records like nobody has ever seen before.  When you have companies like this coming in and almost 40 percent of their company, in one signature, is going to be devoted to what he does, which is one of the most important — important businesses in the world, that’s an unbelievable thing.  When Apple now is going to start building all of their plants here, all because of what we’ve done in terms of — it’s not because he likes me or they like me.  They don’t probably like me at all.  I don’t know.  I think he likes me a little bit, at least.  (Laughter.)MR. WEI:  No, I like you.THE PRESIDENT:  But you know what?  It’s the incentive we’ve created or the negative incentive.  I mean, it’s going to be very costly for people to take advantage of this country.  They can’t come in and steal our money and steal our jobs and take our factories and take our businesses and expect not to be punished, and they’re being punished by tariffs.\nIt’s a very powerful weapon that politicians haven’t used because they were either dishonest, stupid, or paid off in some other form.  And now we’re using them.Q    Have you spoken with President Xi?Q    Agriculture — THE PRESIDENT:  Say it. Q    Have you spoken with President Xi about this this term?THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t want to tell you that. Q    On those incentives, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody. (Cross-talk.) Thank you.  Thank you very much.\nEND                3:07 P.M.

    "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, First Lady Melania Trump, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, and U.S. Representative Maria Salazar hosted a roundtable on Capitol Hill with Members of Congress, Survivors of Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery (NCII), and online safety advocates for a discussion focused on promoting online protection of children and passing S.146/H.R.633, the Take It Down Act.\nThe First Lady delivered opening remarks thanking the U.S. Senate for passing the Take It Down Act, calling on the U.S. House of Representatives to also pass the bill, and expressing her commitment to making the internet a safer platform for young Americans in the digital era.\n“It’s heartbreaking to witness young teens, especially girls, grappling with the overwhelming challenges posed by malicious online content, like deepfakes. This toxic environment can be severely damaging. We must prioritize their well-being by equipping them with the support and tools necessary to navigate this hostile digital landscape. Every young person deserves a safe online space to express themself freely, without the looming threat of exploitation or harm,” said First Lady Melania Trump.\nFollowing Mrs. Trump’s remarks, Members of Congress spoke and multiple survivors of NCII and advocates for online safety shared their personal stories. They joined in calling for the passage of the Take It Down Act. The Discussion addressed online protection, child well-being, and how artificial intelligence is changing the social media landscape.\nSenator Ted Cruz, commented: “For victims of revenge or AI-generated explicit imagery, life can change instantly and permanently. Everyone has the right to have these disturbing images removed from the internet immediately. The bipartisan Take It Down Act empowers victims across the United States, and I am honored that First Lady Melania Trump has lent her strong voice to this cause. Her presence and advocacy are driving real action for teens and children, and her support will be crucial in advancing this bill. I am encouraged by my House colleagues who joined us today, united in their commitment to take swift action. Following the Senate’s unanimous approval, the House must act quickly to send this legislation to President Trump’s desk before more victims are left without recourse.”\nTake It Down Act Advocate, Francesca Mani, said: “A strong Federal law is crucial – one that shifts power back to the victims, ensuring they can remove harmful images within 48 hours. That’s not just policy – that’s real, tangible protection. That’s Take it Down.”\nTake It Down Act Advocate, Elliston Berry, said: “This bipartisan bill is meant to protect American children. Thank you to the First Lady and House leadership for understanding how important this issue is and taking time to learn about this vital piece of legislation. I share my story to give victims a voice they never had and change this horrible situation into something good.”\n###"

But the president is crystal clear… he is going to be a president that tries to achieve peace.”\n- On President Trump’s desire for peace: “Shouldn’t we all be happy that we have a president who’s trying to stop wars and prevent them instead of start them? And I just don’t get it. I really don’t, other than the fact that it’s Donald J. Trump. If this was a Democrat that was doing this, everyone would be saying, well, he’s on his way to the Nobel Peace Prize. This is absurd. We are trying to end a war. You cannot end a war unless both sides come to the table, starting with the Russians. And – and that – that is the point the president has made.”\nNational Security Advisor Mike Waltz on State of the Union\n- On the Oval Office meeting between President Trump and Zelenskyy: “It was not clear Zelenskyy was going to go to negotiations at all — that he would ever be able to negotiate with Putin and whether he shared our goal of ending this war… This was a huge missed opportunity for him and for his country.”\nSecretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick on Sunday Morning Futures\n- On President Trump delivering results: “We’ve had the lowest crossings ever, ever, under Donald Trump because of his ability to negotiate with Canada and Mexico.”\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Fox News Sunday\n- On the danger of continuing the war in Ukraine: “The longer this goes on, not only are more Ukrainians losing their lives, but it increases the potential of this escalation towards World War III … That’s not a cost that President Trump is willing to accept.”\nSecretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Face the Nation\n- On rebuilding the economy: “President Trump’s been in office five weeks… interest rates — the 10-year bond… have been down every week since President Trump was President. Mortgage rates have been down every week. So, that’s a pretty good start.”\nPress Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Media Buzz\n- On cameras being able to witness President Trump’s Oval Office meeting with Ukraine: “President Trump is the most transparent president in history. And as he said, it was great for the cameras to be in there because the American people — and the world — were able to see what the president and his team have seen behind the scenes in negotiating with President Zelenskyy’s team.

impact of foreign competition on economic welfare of domestic industries,” as well as other relevant factors, including:\n(i)    the current and projected demand for timber and lumber in the United States;\n(ii)   the extent to which domestic production of timber and lumber can meet domestic demand;\n(iii)  the role of foreign supply chains, particularly of major exporters, in meeting United States timber and lumber demand;\n(iv)   the impact of foreign government subsidies and predatory trade practices on United States timber, lumber, and derivative product industry competitiveness;\n(v)    the feasibility of increasing domestic timber and lumber capacity to reduce imports; and\n(vi)   the impact of current trade policies on domestic timber, lumber, and derivative product production, and whether additional measures, including tariffs or quotas, are necessary to protect national security.\n\nSec. 3.  Required Actions.  (a)  The Secretary of Commerce shall consult with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies as determined by the Secretary of Commerce to evaluate the national security risks associated with imports of timber, lumber, and their derivative products.\n(b)  No later than 270 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit a report to the President that includes:\n(i)    findings on whether imports of timber, lumber, and their derivative products threaten national security;\n(ii)   recommendations on actions to mitigate such threats, including potential tariffs, export controls, or incentives to increase domestic production; and\n(iii)  policy recommendations for strengthening the United States timber and lumber supply chain through strategic investments and permitting reforms.\n\nSec. 4.  Definitions.  As used in this order:\n(a)  The term “timber” refers to wood that has not been processed.\n(b)  The term “lumber” refers to wood that has been processed, including wood that has been milled and cut into boards or planks.\n\nSec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof;

lumber, paper, bioenergy, and other wood products (timber production) is critical to our Nation’s well-being.  Timber production is essential for crucial human activities like construction and energy production.  Furthermore, as recent disasters demonstrate, forest management and wildfire risk reduction projects can save American lives and communities.\nThe United States has an abundance of timber resources that are more than adequate to meet our domestic timber production needs, but heavy-handed Federal policies have prevented full utilization of these resources and made us reliant on foreign producers.  Our inability to fully exploit our domestic timber supply has impeded the creation of jobs and prosperity, contributed to wildfire disasters, degraded fish and wildlife habitats, increased the cost of construction and energy, and threatened our economic security.  These onerous Federal policies have forced our Nation to rely upon imported lumber, thus exporting jobs and prosperity and compromising our self-reliance.  It is vital that we reverse these policies and increase domestic timber production to protect our national and economic security.\nSec. 2.  Directives to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture.\n(a)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Chief of the United States Forest Service (USFS), respectively, shall each issue new or updated guidance regarding tools to facilitate increased timber production and sound forest management, reduce time to deliver timber, and decrease timber supply uncertainty, such as the Good Neighbor Authority described in 16 U.S.C. 2113a, stewardship contracting pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 6591c, and agreements or contracts with Indian tribes under the Tribal Forest Protection Act as contemplated by 25 U.S.C. 3115a.  The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall also each submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget any legislative proposals that would expand authorities to improve timber production and sound forest management.\n(b)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the Secretary of Commerce, through the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, shall complete a strategy on USFS and BLM forest management projects under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1536) to improve the speed of approving forestry projects.  The Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the FWS, shall also examine any applicable existing authorities that would permit executive departments and agencies (agencies) to delegate consultation requirements under section 7 of the ESA to other agencies and, if necessary, provide a legislative proposal to ensure consultation is streamlined.\n(c)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall together submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, a plan that sets a target for the annual amount of timber per year to be offered for sale over the next 4 years from Federal lands managed by the BLM and the USFS, measured in millions of board feet.\n(d)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior, through the Directors of the FWS and the BLM, and the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Chief of the USFS, shall complete the Whitebark Pine Rangewide Programmatic Consultation under section 7 of the ESA.\n(e)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall consider and, if appropriate and consistent with applicable law, adopt categorical exclusions administratively established by other agencies to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act and reduce unnecessarily lengthy processes and associated costs related to administrative approvals for timber production, forest management, and wildfire risk reduction treatments.\n(f)  Within 280 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall consider and, if appropriate and consistent with applicable law, establish a new categorical exclusion for timber thinning and re-establish a categorical exclusion for timber salvage activities.\nSec. 3.  Streamlined Permitting.  All relevant agencies shall eliminate, to the maximum extent permissible by law, all undue delays within their respective permitting processes related to timber production.  Additionally, all relevant agencies shall take all necessary and appropriate steps consistent with applicable law to suspend, revise, or rescind all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and other agency actions that impose an undue burden on timber production.\nSec. 4.  Endangered Species Committee.  (a)  Agencies are directed to use, to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, the ESA regulations on consultations in emergencies to facilitate the Nation’s timber production.  The Secretary of the Interior, as Chairman of the Endangered Species Committee, shall ensure a prompt and efficient review of all submissions to such committee, to include identification of any legal deficiencies, in order to ensure the timely consideration of exemption applications and, where possible, to resolve such applications before the deadlines set by the ESA.\n(b)  Federal members of the Endangered Species Committee, or their designees, shall coordinate to develop and submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, that identifies obstacles to domestic timber production infrastructure specifically deriving from implementation of the ESA and recommends procedural, regulatory, and interagency improvements.\n(c)  The Secretary of the Interior shall ensure that the Director of the FWS, or the Director’s authorized representative, is available to consult promptly with agencies and to take other appropriate action concerning the applicability of the ESA’s emergency regulations.  The Secretary of Commerce shall ensure that the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, or the Assistant Administrator’s authorized representative, is available for such consultation and to take such other action as may assist in applying the ESA’s emergency regulations.\nSec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law

Trump and Vice President Vance to the American people and the Trump Administration’s relentless pursuit of peace. Speaker Mike Johnson: “Thanks to President Trump – the days of America being taken advantage of and disrespected are OVER. The death and destruction of the Russian-provoked war needs to stop immediately, and only our American President can put these two countries on a path to lasting peace. President Zelenskyy needed to acknowledge that, and accept the extraordinary mineral rights partnership proposal that President Trump put on the table. What we witnessed in the Oval Office today was an American President putting America first.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio: “The only person on the planet who is actively trying to bring an end to this conflict is named Donald Trump, the President of the United States.” National Security Advisor Mike Waltz: “It’s not clear that Zelenskyy truly wants to stop the fighting. He came in, even though he was warned not to, determined to litigate all of that … This was the wrong approach, wrong time in history, and definitely the wrong president to try to do this.” Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard: “Thank you @realDonaldTrump for your unwavering leadership in standing up for the interests of the American people, and peace. What you said is absolutely true: Zelensky has been trying to drag the United States into a nuclear war with Russia/WW3 for years now, and no one has called him on it. Thank you, Vice President @JDVance for speaking out so forcefully and clearly, about the necessity of diplomacy.” UN Ambassador-designate Elise Stefanik: “President Trump will ALWAYS stand up for the American people – especially in the Oval Office. Peace through strength is back on the world stage because of President Trump’s bold and strong leadership.” Sen. Eric Schmitt: “Zelensky was probably used to talking this way to American leaders. Apparently, no one told him that things have changed. The age of America Last foreign policy is over. From this day forward, it’s going to be only America First.” Sen. Lindsey Graham: “I have never been more proud of the president. I was very proud of JD Vance, standing up for our country.” CNN’s Scott Jennings: “All Zelenskyy had to do today was put on a tie, show up, smile, say thank you, sign the papers, and have lunch. That’s it — and he couldn’t do that.” Marc Thiessen: “There was no ambush. Z was set up for success. All he had to do was not get into a public fight and sign the minerals deal.  Not hard. A lot of work went into making a successful moment possible and he blew it and then refused to apologize.” Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller: “The way that President Trump defended Americans after YEARS of being fleeced and abused and taken advantage of and taken for granted — millions of American hearts swelled with overflowing pride today to watch President Trump put Zelenskyy in his place.” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt: “[Zelenskyy] refuses to recognize the practical reality of this war. It has been going on for years, his countrymen are dying, and the people who have been funding this effort — the American people — are sick and tired of footing this bill.” Rep. Victoria Spartz: “It’s such a disservice to the Ukrainian people to play hero and politics and trying to increase his rating … Being so insulting to the American people after how much was done by us for Ukraine and for Europe, I can’t believe it.” Rep. Kevin Hern: “President Trump is determined to end the war in Ukraine. He is determined for the world to get back at peace, as it was when he was in office before.”"

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  We appreciate you being here.  And we’ve put together a great Cabinet.  And we’ve had tremendous success.  We’ve been given a lot of credit for having a very successful first month, and we want to make that many months — and years, actually.  But we’re going to have many good months, and we’re going to have many good years, I hope.  And we’re going to solve a lot of problems.      We’re doing very well with Russia-Ukraine.  President Zelenskyy is going to be coming on Friday.  It’s now confirmed.  And we’re going to be signing an agreement, which will be a very big agreement.  And I want to thank Howard and Scott for the job you guys did in putting it together.  Really did an amazing job.  And that’ll be on rare earth and other things.      And as you know, we’re in for, probably, $350 billion and Europe is in for $100 billion.  And that’s a big difference.  So, we’re in for, probably, three times as much.  And yet, it’s very important to everybody, but Europe is very close.  We have a big ocean separating us.  So, it’s very important for Europe.  And they, hopefully, will step up and do maybe more than they’re doing and maybe a lot more.\nThe previous administration put us in a very bad position, but we’ve been able to make a deal where we’re going to get our money back and we’re going to get a lot of money in the future.  And I think that’s appropriate, because we have taxpayers that are — shouldn’t be footing the bill, and they shouldn’t be footing the bill at more than the Europeans are paying.      So, it’s all been worked out.  We’re happy about it.  And I think that, very importantly, we’re going to be able to make a deal.      Most importantly, by far, we’re going to make a deal with Russia and Ukraine to stop killing people.  They’ll stop killing young Russian soldiers and young Ukrainian soldiers and other people, in addition, in the towns and cities.  And we will consider that a very important thing and a big accomplishment, because it was going nowhere until this administration came in.  They hadn’t spoken to President Putin in two years.  And so, we’ll keep you advised.     Before we begin the Cabinet, I’d like to have Scott\nand a couple of people say a few things.  But most importantly — where are you?     SECRETARY TURNER:  I’m right here, sir.     THE PRESIDENT:  This is a gentleman who’s going places — the head of HUD.  And he’s going to say — you all know him.  And you’re going to say grace —     SECRETARY TURNER:  Yes, sir.     THE PRESIDENT:  — and then we’ll have our meeting, right?\nSECRETARY TURNER:  Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.      SECRETARY TURNER:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Let’s pray.     Father, we thank you for this awesome privilege, Father, to be in your presence.  God, thank you that you’ve allowed us to see this day.  The Bible says that your mercies are new every morning.  And, Father God, we give you the glory and the honor.  Thank you, God, for President Trump, Father, for appointing us.  Father God, thank you for anointing us to do this job.  Father, we pray you’ll give the president and the vice president wisdom, Father God, as they lead.      Father, I pray for all of my colleagues that are here around the table and in this room.  Lord God, we pray that we would lead with a righteous clarity, Father God, and as we serve the people of this country and every perspective agency, every job that we have, Father, we would humble ourselves before you that we would lead in a manner that you’ve called us to lead and to serve.      Father, the Bible says the blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord.  But, Father, we today honor you.  And in your rightful place, Father, thank you for giving us this opportunity to restore faith in this country and be a blessing to the people of America.  And, Lord God, today in our meeting, we pray that you will be glorified in our conversation.         In Jesus’ name, amen.     PARTICIPANTS:  Amen.     THE PRESIDENT:  Scott, that was a very good job you did.  You’ve done that before, haven’t you?  (Laughter.)  Wow.      So, Scott Turner is a terrific young guy.  He’s heading up HUD, and he’s going to make us all very proud, right?     SECRETARY TURNER:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.      In just over one month, illegal border crossings have plummeted by numbers that nobody has actually ever seen before.  It’s much more than 100 percent.\nAnd we’ve unleashed American energy at levels that will soon be reported, but we think we’re going to get it going very quickly.  We have incredible people on the energy front.\nI think we have really great people on every front.  I’ll let you know if they’re not good, but I think they really are.\nAnd we’re fighting every day to get the prices down.  The inflation is stopping slowly, but part of the reason it’s stopping is because of high interest rates and other problems that we inherited.  But we have to get the prices down — not the inflation down — the prices of eggs and various other things.  Eggs are a disaster.      The secretary of Agriculture is going to be showing you a chart that’s actually mindboggling what’s happened — how low they were with us and how high they are now.  But I think we can do something about it —     SECRETARY ROLLINS:  Yes, sir.     THE PRESIDENT:  — Madam Secretary.     SECRETARY ROLLINS:  Yes, sir.     THE PRESIDENT:  And I think you’re going to do a fantastic job in that position.\nOne of the most important initiatives is DOGE, and we have cut billions and billions and billions of dollars.  We’re looking to get it maybe to a trillion dollars.  If we can do that, we’re going to start getting to be at a point where we can think in terms of balancing budgets, believe it or not, something you haven’t heard in many, many years — decades, actually.  And it’s a big — whether it’s this year or next year, I think we’ll be very close to balancing budgets.  And the DOGE is very important.\nAnd Elon is here to give you a summary of what’s happening, some of the things they found — some of the horrible things they found — some of the theft and fraud, and we call it waste and abuse, but a lot of fraud, and probably some fraud that we’re not going to be able to prove is fraud, but when you hear the names and the places where this money is going, it’s a disgrace.      But we’ve requested that a lot of people — we want to make sure that the people are working.  So, letters were sent out, and I think everyone at this table is very much behind it.  And if they aren’t, I’d want them to speak up.  But they’re very much behind it.      Letters were sent out to people just to find out, if the people exist, do they work?  Who do they work for?  Where are they?  You know, where have they been working?  Have they been working for other companies or other entities at all and being paid by the government, so they have two jobs, but they’re supposed to have one?\nAnd the letter asks some simple questions like, “What have you done lately?”  And if they can answer that — because I can.  I can tell you everything I’ve done for the last long period of time — a lot more than a week.\nAnd in many cases, we haven’t gotten responses.  Usually that means that maybe that person doesn’t exist or that person doesn’t want to say they’re working for another company while being paid by the United States government.\nSo, there’s a lot of interesting things.  It’s very unique, but we have a very unique situation because we have a lot of people that were scamming our country.  We have a lot of dishonest people.  We have a lot of people that took advantage of a lot of different situations, and we’re not going to let that happen.\nSo, I’m going to ask, if it’s possible, to have Elon get up first and talk about DOGE, because it seems to be of great interest to everyone.\nI will say that there is a large group of people in this country that have such admiration for what we’re doing.  I got elected with a tremendous vote — winning every swing state, winning the popular vote, winning the counties by thousands of counties.  I think it was 2,800 to 500.  2,800 counties to 500 counties.  Think of that.\nAnd so, we have a mandate to do this, and this is part of the reason I got elected.  I got elected based on taxes and based on many things, the border, but also based on balancing budgets and getting our country back into shape, and this is a big part of it.\nSo, Elon, if you could get up and explain where you are, how you’re doing, and how much we’re cutting.  And it’s an honor to have you.  He’s been a tremendously successful guy.  He’s really working so hard.  And he’s got businesses to run.  And in many ways, they say, “How do you do this?”  And, you know, he’s sacrificing a lot and — getting a lot of praise, I’ll tell you, but he’s also getting hit.  And we would expect that, and that’s the way it works.\nSo, I’d like to have Elon Musk please say a few words.     MR. MUSK:  Well, tha- — thank you —         THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Elon.\nMR. MUSK:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Well, I a- — I actually just call myself humble tech support here — (laughter) — because this is actually — as crazy as it sounds, that — that is almost a literal description of the work that the DOGE team is doing is helping fix the government computer systems.  Many of these systems are extremely old.  They don’t communicate.  There are a lot of mistakes in the systems.  The software doesn’t work.  The — so, we are actually tech support.  It’s — it’s a — it’s ironic, but it’s true.\nThe — the overall goal here with the DOGE team is to help address the enormous deficit.  We simply cannot sustain, as a country, $2 trillion deficits.  The interest rates — just the interest on the national debt now exceeds the Defense Department spending.\nWe spend a lot on the Defense Department, but we’re spending, like, over a trillion dollars on interest.  If this continues, the country will go — become de facto bankrupt.  It’s — it’s not an optional thing.  It is an essential thing.  That — that’s — that’s the reason I’m here and taking a lot of flak and getting a lot of death threats, by the way.  I can, like, stack them up, you know.\nBut if we don’t do this, America will go bankrupt.  That’s why it has to be done.  And I’m confident, at this point — knock on wood, you know — knock on my wooden head — (laughter) — the — there’s a lot of wood up there — that we can actually find a trillion dollars in savings.  That would be roughly 15 percent of the $7 trillion budget.\nAnd obviously, that can only be done with the support of everyone in this room.  And I’d like to thank everyone for — for your support.  Thank you very much this.  This — this can only be done with — with your support.\nSo, this is — it’s really — DOGE is a support function for the president and for the — the agencies and departments to help achieve those savings and to effect- — effectively find 15 percent in reduction in fraud and — and waste.\nAnd — and we bring the receipts.  So, people say, like, “Well, is this real?”  Just go to DOGE.gov.  We l- — we — line item by line item, we specify each item.  So — and w- — and I — I should say, we — also, we will make mistakes.  We won’t be perfect.  But when we make mistake, we’ll fix it very quickly.\nSo, for example, with USAID, one of the things we accidentally canceled, very briefly, was Ebola — Ebola prevention.  I think we all wanted Ebola prevention.  So, we restored the Ebola prevention immediately, and there was no interruption.\nBut we do need to move quickly if we’re — if we’re to achieve a trillion-dollar deficit reduction in tw- — in — in financial year 2026.  It requires saving $4 billion per day, every day from now through the end of September.  But we can do it, and we will do it.\nThank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, do you have any questions of Elon while we’re on the subject of DOGE?  Because we’ll finish off with that.  And if you would have any questions, please ask — you could ask me or Elon.\nGo ahead, please.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Mr. Musk.  I just wanted to ask you, the — President Trump put out a Truth Social today saying that everybody in the Cabinet was — was happy with you.  I just wondered if that — if you had heard otherwise, and if you had heard anything about members of the Cabinet who weren’t happy with the way things were going.  And if so, what are you doing to address those — any dissatisfaction?\nMR. MUSK:  To the best of —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Hey, Elon, let the Cabinet speak just for a second.  (Laughter.)      Is anybody unhappy with Elon?  If you are, we’ll throw them out of here.  (Laughter.)  Is anybody unhappy?  (Applause.)\nThey are — they have a lot of respect for Elon and that he’s doing this.  And some disagree a little bit, but I will tell you, for the most part, I think everyone is not only happy, they’re thrilled.\nSo, go ahead, Elon.\nSECRETARY ROLLINS:  And grateful.\nMR. MUSK:  And President Trump has put together, I think, the best cabinet ever, literally.  So, I — and I do not give false praise.  This — this is an incredible group of people.  I don’t think such a talented team has actually ever been assembled.  I think it’s literally the best cabinet that the country has ever had.  And I think the companies should be incredibly appreciative of the people in this room.\nQ    Mr. President —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Please.  Yeah.  Go ahead.\nQ    Mr. President, thank you.  Mr. Musk.  Are there — about half of the government employees so far appear to have responded to your request for what they’ve been doing over the past week.  Is there a timeline in place for next moves for people being fired?  And when can the American people expect to see results from that?\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.  Well, to be — to be clear, like, the — I think that email, perhaps, was misinterpreted as a performance review, but actually it was a pulse check review.  “Do you have a pulse?”  (Laughter.)  “Do you have a pulse and two neurons?”  (Laughter.)  So, if you have a pulse and two neurons, you can reply to an email.\nThis is, you know, I think, not a high bar, is what I’m saying.  This is a — should be — anyone could accomplish this.\nBut what we are trying to get to the bottom of is we think there are a number of people on the government payroll who are dead, which is probably why they can’t respond, and — and some people who are not real people, like they’re literally fictional individuals that are collecting payche- — well, somebody is collecting paychecks on a fictional individual.  So, we’re just literally trying to figure out are these people real, are they alive, and can they write an email, which I think is a reasonable expectation for the Amer- — you know, the American public would have at least that expectation of someone in the public sector.\nQ    Mr. Musk —\nQ    Mr. Musk —\nQ    — roughly a million employees —\nMR. MUSK:  (Laughs.)  This is not a — this is not a high bar, guys.  Come on.  (Laughter.)\nQ    Roughly a million employees have responded so far to this email.  Does that mean that the remaining 1 million or so federal employees now risk being terminated?  And is it your understanding and expectation when you post a directive on X that the Cabinet secretaries will follow that order?  Because several agencies have instructed employees that this is voluntary or not to respond.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, to be cl — so, I guess there was a — like, last week, the president en- — encouraged me, via Truth Social and also via phone call, to be more aggressive.  And I was like, “Okay.”  You know, “Yes, sir, Mr. President.  We will indeed do that.”  The president is the commander in chief.  I — I do what the president asks.\nSo — and I said, “Can we send out an email to everyone, just saying, ‘What did you get done last week?’”  The president said yes.  So, I — I did that.\nAnd, you know, we — we got a partial response.  But we — we’re going to send another email.  But we — our — our goal is not to be capricious or — or unfair.  It’s — we want to give people every opportunity to send an email and the email could simply be “What I’m working on is too sensitive or classified to — to describe.”  Like, literally, just re- — that would be sufficient.  We’re — we’re — you know, I think this is just common sense.\nQ    And what is your target number for — for how many workers, employees you’re looking to cut total?\nMR. MUSK:  We — we wish to keep everyone who is doing a job that is essential and doing that job well.  But if — if they’re — if the job is not essential or they’re not doing the job well, they obviously should not be on the public payroll.\n(Cross-talk.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I have to — I would like to add —\n(Cross-talk.)\nWait a minute.  Wait.  Wait.  I’d like to add that those million people that haven’t responded, though, Elon, they are on the bubble.  You know, I wouldn’t say that we’re thrilled about it.  You know, they haven’t responded.  Now, maybe they don’t exist.  Maybe we’re paying people that don’t exist.\nDon’t forget, we just got here.  This group just got here.  But those people are on the bubble, as they say.  You know, maybe they’re going to be gone.  Maybe they’re not around.  Maybe they have other jobs.  Maybe they moved and they’re not where they’re supposed to be.  A lot of things could have happened.\nI wouldn’t say that Biden ran a very tight administration.  They spent money like nobody has ever spent money before, wasted money — the Green New Scam, all of the different things they spent money on.\nAnd you’ve seen that.  You’ve seen that with some of the things that I read in speeches.  I read them, and people can’t believe, when I read them, $20 million here, $30 million here for, you know, a little educational course on something.  Circumcision, right?  Circumcision.  $20 million to inform the people of such-and-such a country on other things and other things other than that.\nSo, yeah, those people are — right now, we’re trying to find out who those people are that haven’t responded.  Now, there’ll be some agencies — like Marco has people within State that are right now doing very classified, very confidential work.  And we understand that, and we’ve talked.  And, you know, we’re being a little more surgical.\nAnd Marco is doing a lot of things himself.  He’s — and some of the secretaries are.  We’re going to be going to them.  We’re going to be talking about it today.  We’re going to ask them to do their own DOGE.  In other words, they’ll look in their group and who —\nI spoke with Lee Zeldin, and he thinks he’s going to be cutting 65 or so percent of the people from Environmental, and we’re going to speed up the process, too, at the same time.  He had a lot of people that weren’t doing their job — they were just obstructionists — and a lot of people that didn’t exist, I guess, Lee, too.  You found a lot of empty spots that the people weren’t there.  They didn’t exist.\nAnd I think Education is going to be one of those.  You go around Washington, you see all these buildings — the Department of Education.  We want to move education back to the states, where it belongs.  Iowa should have education.  Indiana should run their own education.  You’re going to see education go way up.\nRight now, we’re ranked at the very bottom of the list, but we’re at the top of the list in one thing: the cost per pupil.  We spend more money per pupil than any other country in the world, and yet it’s Denmark and Norway, Sweden.  And I — you hate to say this — and, you know, we’re going to get along very well with China, but it’s a competitor: They’re at the top of the list.  They’re among the top 10, usually.  And they’re a very big country, so we can’t use that as an excuse — right? — because we’re a very big country too.\nBut we’re – we were ranked last time — under Biden, we were ranked 40 out of 40.  They do the 40 certain nations that they’ve done for a long time.  It seems to be 40, for whatever reason.  And we were ranked number 40.  A year ago, we were 38.  Then we were 39.  We’re — we hit 40.  And so, we’re last in that, and we’re first in cost per pupil.  So, I would say that’s unacceptable.\nLawrence, do you have something?  Go ahead.\nQ    So, Mr. President, I know you like competition, and I know it’s early.  So, which department are you most impressed with?\nAnd then, to Mr. Mu- — (laughter).  That’s the first one.  And, Mr. Musk, which department have you received the most resistance from?      Mr. President, you first.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think both of those questions are a little bit — well, you’re a pretty controversial guy.  (Laughter.)  Look, it’s very early.  Right now, I think I’m impressed with everybody.  So far, everybody.  If I wasn’t, in the first month, we’d — and some of them just got here.  They just got approved two days ago, right?\nBut I think I’m very impressed with everybody.  So far, I’m very happy with all of the choices.\nI think that Elon has done incredibly with some groups.  And some groups are much easier than others.  It is true: State is a, you know, very difficult situation.  We’re right now negotiating very successfully, I think, with Russia and with Ukraine, and we have a lot of countries involved.  And we have to be a little bit careful what we do and who we’re terminating.  But Marco is doing that very — I think he’s going to be very precise.  It’s going to be —\nWe’re cutting down government.  We’re cutting down the size of government.  We have to.  We’re bloated.  We’re sloppy.  We have a lot of people that aren’t doing their job.  We have a lot of people that don’t exist.      You look at Social Security as an example.  I mean, you have so many people in Social Security where, if you believe it, they’re 200 years old.  And what we’re doing is finding out: Are checks going out for that and is somebody cashing those checks who’s maybe 35 years old?  Okay?      So, there’s a lot of dishonesty.  There’s a lot of fraud.      But I think at this moment, I’ll take Elon off the spot.  I think that he’s impressed — he said it very well –better than I can say it — that he’s impressed with the people in this room.  Very impressed.  And I am too.  And it’s too early to say, but I think everybody is on board.  They all know — we want to balance a budget.  We want to have a balanced budget within a reasonably short period of time, meaning maybe by next year or the year after, but maybe — maybe even sooner than that.      Q    Mr. President, your — your number one issue was the border.  We just got new information that they’re doxing our federal agents.  They’re putting their personal information out there, these activists, and they’re disrupting the operations.  So, you got Tren de Aragua running all across the country —     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we have activists.  That’s true.  And a lot of those —     Q    So, what are we going to do about the activists —     THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  A lot of those activists are acting illegally.  And we’ll give that to our attorney general, and she’ll take a look at that very strongly.  But we’re also having tremendous support from Border Patrol, from ICE.  The ICE agents have been unbelievable.  Border Patrol — their leadership at Border Patrol has been incredible, and they’re working very well.      And, as you know — and I saw you reporting it this morning, actually — we set records on the least number of illegal aliens coming in, migrants coming into our country that we’ve had in more than 50 years.  And we did this all within a period of weeks, because we took over a mess.  The world was pouring in.  And remember, they were coming in from jails and prisons and mental institutions and insane asylums, and they were gang members and drug dealers.  Anybody who wanted to come in, they came.  And from not just South America, from all over the world.  So, it’s amazing what they’ve done.      And Kristi and — and Tom Homan, the job they’ve done has been absolutely amazing.  We set records for — and we want people to come into our country, by the way, but they want to come in — they have to come in legally.      I want that to be really understood.  We want people in our country, but they have to come in legally.      Q    Can I follow on that, Mr. President?\nQ    Mr. President.\nQ    About the — the Trump gold card idea —     THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.     Q    — that you unveiled yesterday.     THE PRESIDENT:  I hope you liked it.  (Laughter.)     Q    I await more information.  But the question is: Does this reflect a view, on your part, that the American immigration system has never been properly monetized as you feel it should be?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, not so much monetized.  It hasn’t been properly run.  I get calls from, as an example, companies where they want to hire the number one student at a school.  A person comes from India, China, Japan, lots of different places, and they go to Harvard, the Wharton School of Finance.  They go to Yale.  They go to all great schools.  And they graduate number one in their class, and they are made job offers, but the offer is immediately rescinded because you have no idea whether or not that person can stay in the country.  I want to be able to have that person stay in the country.      These companies can go and buy a gold card, and they can use it as a matter of recruitment.      At the same time, the company is using that money to pay down debt.  We’re going to — we’re going to pay down a lot of debt with that.     Q    Are they going to have to —     THE PRESIDENT:  And I think the gold card is going to be used by — not only for that.  I mean, they’ll be used by companies.  I mean, I could see Apple — I’ve spoken with Tim Cook — and, by the way, he’s going to make a $500 billion investment in the country only because of the results of the election and, I think, because of tariffs.  He’s going to want to be in the country because of tariffs.  Because if you’re in the country, there is no tariff.  If you’re out of the country, you got to pay tariffs.  And that’s going to be a great investment, I think, that he’s making.  I know it’s going to be a great investment.      But we have to be able to get people in the country, and we want people that are productive people.  And I will tell you, the people that can pay $5 million, they’re going to create jobs.  They’re going to spend a lot of money on jobs.  They’re going to have to pay taxes on that too.  So, they’re going to be hiring people, they’re going to be bringing people in and companies in.  And, I don’t know, maybe it will sell like crazy.  I happen to think it’s going to sell like crazy.  It’s a bargain.     But we’ll —\nQ    Will they have to commit to a certain number?     THE PRESIDENT:  — know fairly soon.  I think Howard and — and Scott — a few of you, really, are responsible for it.  But, Howard, if you want to discuss that for a couple of minutes, I think I’d like to have you.  I think it’s going to be a very successful program.     SECRETARY LUTNICK:  Sure.     THE PRESIDENT:  This is Commerce.     SECRETARY LUTNICK:  So, the EB-5 program, which has been around for many years, had investment of a million dollars into projects in America.  And those projects were often suspect, they didn’t really work out, there wasn’t any oversight of it.  And so, for a million-dollar investment, you got a visa, and then you came into the country and ended up with a green card.      So, it was poorly overseen, poorly executed.  Then you had our border open, where millions of people came through.      So, the idea is we will have a proper business.  We will modify the EB-5 agreement.  Kristi and I are working on it together.  For $5 million, they’ll get a license from the Department of Commerce.  Then they’ll make a proper investment on the EB-5, right?  And we think Scott and I will design the EB-5 investment model, because Scott and I are the best people together to do that.  So, this is joint.      This is exactly the Trump administration.  We all work together.  We work it out to be the best.  And if we sell — just remember — 200,000 — there’s a line for EB-5 of 250,000 right now — 200,000 of these gold green cards is $1 trillion\nto pay down our debt, and that’s why the president is doing it, because we are going to balance this budget, and we are going to pay off the debt under President Trump.      Q    Mr. —\nQ    And to qualify, do you have to promise and make commitments to create a certain number of jobs here in the U.S.?     THE PRESIDENT:  No.  No.  Because not all these people are going to be job builders.  They’ll be successful people, or they’ll be people that were hired from colleges, like — sort of like paying an athlete a bonus.  I mean, Apple or one of the companies will go out and they’ll spend five mil- — they’ll buy five of them, and they’re going to get five people.      Look, I’ve had the complaint where — I’ve had the complaint from a lot of companies where they go out to hire people, and they can’t hire them b- — out of colleges.  And you know what they do?  They go back to India, or they go back to the country where they came, and they open up a company, and they become billionaires.  They become — and they’re employing thousands and there are a lot of examples.\nThere are some really big examples where they were forced out of the country.  They graduated top in their class at a great school, and they weren’t able to stay.  This is all the time you hear it.\nAnd the biggest complaint I get from companies, other than overregulation, which we took care of, but we’re going to have to take care of it here, because a lot of that was put back on by Biden.  But the biggest complaint is the fact that they can’t have any longevity with people.  This way, they have pretty much unlimited longevity.\nAlso, with the $5 million, you know, that’s a path to citizenship.  So, that’s going to be — it’s sort of a green card-plus, and it’s a path to citizenship.  We’re going to call it the gold card.  And I think it’s going to be very treasured.  I think it’s going to do very well.  And we’re going to start selling, hopefully, in about two weeks.\nNow, just so you understand, if we sell a million — right? — a million, that’s $5 trillion.  Five trillion.  Howard was using a different number, but that’s $5 trillion.  If we sell 10 million, which is possible — 10 million highly productive people coming in or people that we’re going to make productive — they’ll be young, but they’re talented, like a talented athlete — that’s $50 trillion.\nThat means our debt is totally paid off, and we have $15 trillion above that.  And — now, I don’t know that we’re going to sell that many.  Maybe we won’t so many at all.  But I think we’re going to sell a lot, because I think there’s — there really is a thirst.\nNo other country can do this, because people don’t want to go to other countries.  They want to come here.  Everybody wants to come here, especially since November 5th.  (Laughter.)\n(Cross-talk.)\nSECRETARY LUTNICK:  They’ll all be vetted, by the way.  All these people will be vetted.\nQ    How?\nSECRETARY LUTNICK:  Okay?  They’ll be vetted.\nQ    Mr. President, on Ukraine.  Can you talk a lot — a little bit about what type of security guarantees you’re willing to make?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much.  We’re going to have Europe do that, because it’s in — you know, we’re talking about Europe is their next-door neighbor.  But we’re going to make sure everything goes well.\nAnd as you know, we’ll be making a — we’ll be really partnering with Ukraine in terms of rare earth.  We very much need rare earth.  They have great rare earth.  We’ll be working with Secretary Burgum and with Chris.  You’ll be working on that together.\nAnd we’re going to be able to have tremendous — I mean, this gives us — because we don’t have that much of it here.  We have some, but we don’t have that much, and we need a lot more to really propel us to the next level of — to lead in every way.  We’re leading right now with AI.  We’re leading with everything right now, but we have to — we need resources.\nWe have to double our electric capacity.  We have to do many things.  We have to really triple, if you think of it, the electric capacity from what we have right now, if you can believe it.  (Laughter.)\nQ    But will the United States — can I —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, I just say this.  So, the deal we’re making gets us — it brings us great wealth.  We get back the money that we spent, and we hope that we’re going to be able to settle this up.\nWe want to settle it.  We want to stop — I tell you what.  I’m doing it for two reasons, but the number one reason, by far, is to watch — all these people being killed.  I see pictures every week from — I assume satellite pictures, mostly, but there’s some pictures on site of thousands of soldiers that are being killed.  They’re being decimated, because equipment today — military equipment is so powerful and so devastating.  And, number one, I want to see people stop.\nAnd they’re not from here.  They’re from primarily two other countries.\nAnd then, by the way, let’s talk about the Middle East.  We got to solve that problem too.  And that’s come a long way.  We’re doing very well in that also.  A lot of things are happening on that.  But I’m watching soldiers being killed — Ukrainian and Russian soldiers being killed.  My number one thing is to get that stopped.\nMy number two thing is I don’t want to have to pay any more money, because we’ve — Biden has spent $350 billion without any chance of getting it back.  Now we’re going to be getting all of that money back, plus a lot more.  And we provided a great thing.  I mean, we’ve provided something very important, and we’ll be working with Ukraine and — because we’ll be taking that — we’re going to be taking what we’re entitled to take.\nNow, they spent $350 billion, and Europe spent $100 billion.  Now, does anybody really think that’s fair?  But then we find out, a little while ago — not so long ago, a few months ago, I found out that the money they spent, they get back, but the money we spent, we don’t get back.  I said, “Well, we’re going to get it back.”\nAnd we’ll be able to make a deal.  And again, President Zelenskyy is coming to sign the deal.  And it’s a great thing.  It’s a great deal for Ukraine, too, because they get us over there, and we’re going to be working over there.  We’ll be on the land.  And, you know, in that way, it’s — there’s sort of automatic security, because nobody’s going to be messing around with our people when we’re there.  And so, we’ll be there in that way.\nBut Europe will be watching it very closely.  I know that UK has said and France has said that they want to put — they volunteered to put so-called peacekeepers on the site.  And I think that’s a good thing.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Mr. President, you had mentioned the high cost of eggs, and we’ve seen consumer confidence this week have a sharp drop from last month — the biggest dip in, I believe, three years.  Why is that — your assessment, why is that the case and is there anything you can do?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that consumer confidence — if you look at confidence in the nation, it had the biggest increase in the history of the chart.  It went up 42 points in a period of, like, days after the election, since the election.  So, since the election, the confidence in our nation — including right track, wrong track — the first time it’s ever happened, where we were on the right track, because this country has been on the wrong track for a long time.\nSo, the confidence in business, confidence in the country has reached an all-time high.  We have never reached levels like we are right now.\nOkay.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Mr. President, you said — Mr. President, you’ve been very clear in saying that as long as you’re president, Iran will never get a nuclear weapon.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s true.\nQ    Is it also your policy that as long as you’re president, China will never take Taiwan by force?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I never comment on that.  I don’t comment on any — because I don’t want to ever put myself in that position.  And if I said it, I certainly wouldn’t be saying it to you.  I’d be saying it to other people, maybe people around this table — (laughter) — and very specific people around this table.\nQ    Is it a concern (inaudible)?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, I don’t want to put myself in that position.  But I can tell you what, I have a great relationship with President Xi.  I’ve had a great relationship with him.  We want them to come in and invest.\nI see so many things saying that we don’t want China in this country.  That’s not right.  We want them to invest in the United States.  That’s good.  That’s a lot of money coming in.  And we’ll invest in China.  We’ll do things with China.\nThe relationship we’ll have with China would be a very good one.  I see all of these phony reports that we don’t want their money; we don’t want anything to do with them.  That’s wrong.\nWe’re going to have a good relationship with China, but they won’t be able to take advantage of us.  What they did to Biden was — he didn’t know what was happening.  He didn’t know what he was doing.  The administration didn’t know what they were doing.  It was very sad to watch.      But we’re going to have a good relationship with China and Russia and Ukraine and the Middle East.  We’re doing things that —\nLook, when I left, we had no wars.  We had defeated ISIS totally.  We had no inflation.  We didn’t have the Afghanistan withdrawal — the worst withdrawal anybody has ever seen.  I think that’s one of the reasons that President Putin looked at that.  He said, “Wow, these guys are a paper tiger.  Look at” — we’re no paper tiger.\nDon’t forget: We got rid of ISIS in three weeks.  People said it would take five years.  We did it, because when I came in, I let them do what they had to do.  And the man that headed that operation is now going to be your — your chairman, right?\nSECRETARY HEGSETH:  Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\nSECRETARY HEGSETH:  Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And — “Razin” Caine.  I liked him right from the beginning.  As soon as I heard his name, I said, “That’s my guy.”\nOkay.  Any other questions?\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Mr. President, has there been enough de- — decreases in crossings at the border for you to continue the pause on tariffs against Mexico and Canada?  And, if not —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  I’m going to — I’m not stopping the tariffs, no.  Millions of people have died because of the fentanyl that comes over the border.\nQ    Even with the 90 percent drop in border crossings, though, this —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, that’s — well —\nQ    — last month compared to about a year ago?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, they’ve been good, but that’s also due to us.  Mostly due to us.  I mean —\nQ    Mr. President —     Q    Mr. President, on CBS —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — it’s very hard.  It’s, right now, very hard to come through the border.  But the — look, the damage has been done.  We’ve lost millions of people due to fentanyl.  It comes mostly from China, but it comes through Mexico, and it comes through Canada.\nQ    Mr. Presi- —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And I have to tell you that, you know, on April 2nd — I was going to do it on April 1st, but I’m a little bit superstitious, so I made it April 2nd — the tariffs go on, not all of them but a lot of them.  And I think you’re going to see something that’s going to be amazing.\nWe’ve been taken advantage of as a country for a long period of time.  We’ve been — we’ve been tariffed, but we didn’t tariff.  Now, I did.  When I was here, I tariffed.  We took in $700 billion from China — $700 billion.  Not one president in this — in the history of our country took in 10 cents from China.  At the same time, China respected us.\nNow, when COVID came in, that was a different deal.  I used to call it the China virus.  I guess I can call it the China virus again, but, you know, it was — it’s an accurate term, but I won’t do that out of respect to China.  Okay?\n(Cross-talk.)\nSay it again.  What?\nQ    On Gaza.  I just wondered if there’s any progress towards the second phase of the ceasefire that you can tell us about.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m very disappointed when I see four — four bodies came in today.  These are young people.  Young people don’t die.  Okay?  Young people don’t die.  These are young people.  Four bodies came in today.  They think they’re doing us a favor by sending us bodies.\nSo, look, that’s a decision that has to be made by Israel, by Bibi, but Israel has to make that decision.  We got a lot of hostages back, but it’s very sad what happened to those people.  I mean, you had a young lady with her hand practically blown off.  You know why it blew up?  Because she put up her hand to try and stop a bullet that was coming her way, and it hit her hand and blew off her fingers, big part of her hand.\nThis is a vicious group of people, and Israel is going to have to decide what they’re doing.  Phase one is going to be ending.  Think of it: Today, they sent in four bodies.  Bodies.\nAnd I will say one thing, though.  I’ve spoken to a lot of the parents and a lot of the people involved.  They want those bodies almost as much and maybe even just as much as they wanted their son or their daughter.  Amazing.  “Please, sir.  Please.  My son is dead, but they have his body.  Please can you get it for us?”  They — it’s the biggest thing.  It’s incredible the level — they want the bodies of these people.  They’re dead.  They’re dead.\nAnd, you know, when I saw the ones that came in two weeks ago, they looked like they just got out of a concentration camp.  Then, the following week, a group came in, and they weren’t as bad — in as bad of shape.\nBut Israel is going to have to make a decision.  You’re right, phase one, and now phase two has started.  And today, we got some, you know, very, very sad — we knew they were dead, by the way.  We knew they were going to be bodies, as opposed to people that were living.  But it’s a very sad situation.\nAt some point, somebody is going to say we got to do something about this.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Mr. President, you were just talking about Afghanistan and the botched withdrawal.  Have all the generals or command staff that were involved with the withdrawal been fired or relieved of duty?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, that’s a great idea.  It’s — (laughter) — sorry, I’m not going to tell this man what to do, but I will say that.  If I had his place, I’d fire every single one of them, Pete.  Pete, that’s a very good question.\nSECRETARY HEGSETH:  Well, it’s a question we’ve thought a lot about.  We’re doing a complete review of every single aspect of what happened with the botched withdrawal of Afghanistan and plan to have full accountability.  It’s one of the first things we announced at the Defense Department for that reason, sir.\nCertainly General “Razin” Caine, who’s on his way in, was not a part of that.  Instead, was a part of leading the effort against ISIS by untying the hands of war fighters and finishing the job properly and then bringing our troops home.\nSo, we’re taking a very different view, obviously, than the previous administration, and there will be full accountability.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t see big promotions in that group.  (Laughter.)  And I think they’re going to be largely gone.  I know the man on my left.  I think they’re going to be largely gone.\nThat was a horrible display.  And, you know, I’ve dealt with the parents and the family of the 13 that were killed.  But, you know, nobody ever talks about the 40 that were so badly hurt, with the arms and the legs and the face and the whole thing — the missing arms and legs.  It was so terrible, the way that was handled.\nAnd it should have been gone through Bagram.  We have a big base with big fences that nobody can get in, and you have, you know, hundreds of acres, instead of a little local airport where the whole place went crazy.  That was so badly handled.  And I would think that most of those people are going to be gone.\nQ    Are we going to take Bagram back?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, I’ll tell you what has bothered me very much — very, very much: We give billions of dollars to Afghanistan.  Nobody knows that.  Nobody knew that.  Do you know we give billions of dollars to Afghanistan?  And yet we left behind all of that equipment, which wouldn’t have happened.\nYou know, we were getting out under me.  I’m the one that got it down to 5,000 people.  We were going to get out, but we were going to keep Bagram, not because of Afghanistan but because of China, because it’s exactly one hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles.\nSo, we were going to keep Bagram.  We were going to keep a small force on Bagram.  We were going to have Bagram Air Base, one of the biggest air bases in the world.  One of the biggest runways, one of the most powerful runways, in the sense that it was very heavy concrete and steel.  You could carry about anything.  You could land anything on those runways.\nWe gave it up.  And you know who’s occupying it right now?  China.  China.  Biden gave it up.  So, we’re going to keep that, and we’re going to have a withdrawal, and we’re going to take our equipment.  We’re going to do it properly.  We’re going to do it very — we’re going to keep the equipment.      Well, they ran out.  It was — what happened there was a — in fact, you know, in all fairness to Putin, when he saw that, he said, “Well, this is our time to go and go into Ukraine,” I guess, because it was — the timing seemed to be about right.      But we send them billions of dollars in aid, which nobody knows.  If they — if the American public knew that — they know it now.  And if we’re doing that, I think they should give our equipment back.  And I told Pete to study that.\nBut we left billions — tens of billions of dollars’ worth of equipment behind.  Brand-new trucks.  You see them display it every year on their little roadway someplace where they have a road and they drive the — you know, waving the flag and talking about America.  Beautiful equipment that’s all — I mean, the top-of-the-line stuff, brand-new stuff.  Now it’s getting older.      But you know what?  We’re going to pay them.  I think we should get a lot of that equipment back.      You know that Afghanistan is one of the biggest sellers of military equipment in the world.  You know why?  They’re selling the equipment that we left.  We’re first.  They were second or third.  Can you believe it?  They’re selling 777,000\nrifles, 70,000 armor-plated — many of them were armor-plated trucks and vehicles — 70,000.      If you think of a used car lot, the biggest one in the country, you have — I would say, JD, if somebody had 500 cars, that would be a lot.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, that would be quite a lot.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  This is 70,000 vehicles we had there, and we left it for them.  I think we should get it back.     (Cross-talk.)     Q    Mr. President, the spending bill that passed last night aims to cut $2 trillion.     THE PRESIDENT:  Right.     Q    Can you guarantee that Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security will not be touched?     THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  I mean, I have said it so many times, you shouldn’t be asking me that question.  Okay?  This will not be “read my lips.”  It won’t be “read my lips” anymore: We’re not going to touch it.     Now, we are going to look for fraud.  I’m sure you’re okay with that, like people that shouldn’t be on, people that are illegal aliens and others — criminals, in many cases.  And that’s with Social Security.  We have a lot of people — you see that immediately.  When you see people that are 200 years old that are being sent checks for Social Security — some of them are actually being sent checks.\nSo, we’re tracing that down, and I have a feeling that Pam is going to do a very good job with that.  But you have a lot of fraud.      But, no, I’m not — we’re not doing anything on that.     Q    Mr. President, part of your mission, sir —     Q    Mr. President — Mr. President, on CBS News.  Mr. President, you’re in litigation —         Q    Part of your mission has been — thank you.  I’m sorry.      Part of your mission has been to restore executive control over the executive branch.  Is it your view of your authority that you have the power to call up any one of or all of the people seated at this table and issue orders that they’re bound to follow?     THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, yeah.  They’ll follow the orders.  Yes, they will.      Q    No exceptions?      THE PRESIDENT:  No except- — well, let’s see.  Let me think.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She’ll have an exception.  (The president points at Secretary Rollins.)  (Laughter.)     Of course, no exceptions.  You know that.     Q    Mr. President, can you clarify the Canada/Mexico tariffs.  You had put that 30-day pause.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    You just referred to —     THE PRESIDENT:  It’s 25 percent.     Q    Twenty-five percent.  When does it go into effect?     THE PRESIDENT:  April 2nd.      Q    April 2nd for Canada and Mexico?     THE PRESIDENT:  Correct.  And for —     Q    And for the reciprocal?     THE PRESIDENT:  — and for everything.      SECRETARY LUTNICK:  Well, we have the — the — fentanyl-related is a pause.  If they can prove to the president they’ve done an excellent job, that’s what they first do in 30 days.     Q    Have you guys seen any changes?     SECRETARY LUTNICK:  But then the overall is April 2nd.  So, the big transaction is April 2nd, but the fentanyl-related things, if they’re working hard on the border, at the end of that 30 days, they have to prove to the president that they’ve satisfied him to that regard.  If they have —     THE PRESIDENT:  It’s going to be hard to satisfy.     SECRETARY LUTNICK:  — then we’ll give them a pause or he won’t.      THE PRESIDENT:  It’s going to be hard to satisfy.     SECRETARY LUTNICK:  But that’s up to him to see.     THE PRESIDENT:  We lose 300,000 people a year to fentanyl.  Not 100-, not 95-, not 60-, like you read.  You know, you’ve been reading it for years.      We lost, in my opinion, over the last couple of years, on average, maybe close to 300,000 people dead, and the families are ruined.  You know, when they lose a daughter, when they lose a son, the families are never the same.  You’re never going to be the same.  So, you’re talking about a million people.      But when the daughters die, I see it — daughters die and the sons die because of fentanyl.  And in some cases, they don’t even know they’re taking it.  They — they’re buying something else, and it’s laced with fentanyl, and they end up dying.  And I’ve known many people who have lost children to fentanyl and for other reasons, but to fentanyl.  It’s such a big killer.  And those people are never the same people.          I mean, I’ve seen people that — for the rest of their lives, they’re not the same people.  They’re so different, it’s not even believable.  Dynamic people, happy people that are — they die a miserable death.  And that’s because of the crap that comes in through China and through Mexico and through Canada.  A lot of it comes through Canada.      The — Canada — look, we support Canada $200 billion a year in subsidies one way or the other.  We let them make millions of cars.  We let them send us lumber.  We don’t need their lumber.  We’re going to free up our lumber.  Lee is going to do — the head of environmental.  We’re going to free up our lumber.  We have the best lumber there is.  We don’t need their lumber.  What do we need their lumber for?\nWhen you look at the — we subsidize them $200 billion a year.  Without us, Canada can’t make it.  You know, Canada relies on us 95 percent.  We rely on them 4 percent.  Big difference.  And I say Canada should be our 51st state.  There’s no tariffs, no nothing.          And — and I say that, we give them military protection.  They have a very small military.  They spend very little money on military.  Or NATO, they’re just about last in terms of payment, because they say, “Why should we spend on military?”  That’s a tremendous cost.  Most nations can’t afford to even think about it.  “Why should we spend on military?  The United States protects us.”      And I would say that’s largely true.  We protect Canada.  But it’s not fair.  It’s not fair that they’re not paying their way.  And if they had to pay their way, they couldn’t exist.      When I spoke to — let’s call it the prime minister, rather than the governor.  (Laughter.)  But when I spoke to him, I said, “Why are we giving you $200 billion a year?”  He was unable to answer the question.  I said, “Why are we letting you make millions of cars and send them in?”  He was unable to answer the question — Justin Trudeau, a nice guy.  I think he’s a very good guy.  I call him Governor Trudeau.      He should be governor, because the fact is that if we don’t give them cars — we don’t have to give them cars.  The c- — tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell cars into the United States.  The tariffs will make it impossible to — for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States.\nAnd all I’m asking to do is break even or lose a little bit, but not lose $200 million.  And we love Canada.  I love Canada.  I love the people of Canada.  And — but, honestly, it’s not fair for us to be supporting Canada.  And if we don’t support them, they don’t subsist as a — as a nation.\nOkay.\nQ    Mr. President, when you were talking to Elon —\nQ    Mr. President, on the EU tariffs.  Mr. President, have you made a decision on what level you will seek on tariffs on the European Union?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We have made a decision, and we’ll be announcing it very soon.  And it’ll be 25 percent, generally speaking, and that’ll be on cars and all other things.\nAnd European Union is a different case than Canada — different kind of case.  They’ve really taken advantage of us in a different way.  They don’t accept our cars.  They don’t accept, essentially, our farm products.  They use all sorts of reasons why not.  And we accept everything of them, and we have about a $300 billion deficit with the European Union.\nNow, I love the countries of Europe.  I guess I’m from there at some point, a long time ago, right?  (Laughter.)  But indirectly — well, pretty directly, too, I guess.  But I love the countries of Europe.  I — I love all countries, frankly.  All different.\nBut European Union has been — it was formed in order to screw the United States.  I mean, look, let’s be honest.  The European Union was formed in order to screw the United States.  That’s the purpose of it, and they’ve done a good job of it, but now I’m president.\nQ    What will happen if these countries or the EU retaliate?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They can’t.  I mean, they can try, but they can’t.\nQ    China did.  They imposed tariffs —\nQ    They are pledging to, sir.\nQ    — that are — went into effect, China’s retaliatory tariffs —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  That’s right.  But —\nQ    — on the — the 10th of February.  Has there been any —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.\nQ    — impact that you’ve been able to observe?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  No, they can do it, and they can try, but the numbers can never equal what ours, because we can go off.  We are the pot of gold.  We’re the one that everybody wants.  And they can retaliate, but it cannot be a successful retaliation, because we just go cold turkey.  We don’t buy anymore.  And if that happens, we win.\nQ    Are you talking to Erik Prince about privatat- —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No.\nQ    — privatizing deportations?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I haven’t.  I haven’t.\nQ    Mr. President, you’re in litigation with CBS News.  Is this a case that you’d like to see go to trial, or are you open a settelm- —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  With who?\nQ    CBS, the — “60 Minutes.”\nTHE PRESIDENT:  CBS?\nQ    Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, CBS did something that was amazing.  Kamala was unable to answer a question properly, and they took the question that they asked, and they inserted an answer.  They gave her an answer.  This was two days before the election, right before — the Sunday night before the election.  And they wrote out a — they put her words from another question that was asked about a half an hour later, and they put that into the question.\nNobody’s ever even heard of it before.  Nobody’s ever heard of anything like this before.  But they then did it, they say, on numerous occasions.  And the FCC is looking at it very strongly, and everybody’s looking at it, and I’m — but nobody’s ever seen anything.\nThink of it.  They took her answers, and they changed them.  And I don’t mean they changed a word or two, or they cut off a half a sentence, or they cut off a couple of words.  I mean, I’ve had that happen too.  But that, you — you just say — you know, then they say, “Well, we want brevity.  You know, we wanted to do it for time.”\nQ    Would — would you encourage —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They took out her answer, and they inserted an entirely different answer that made her sound competent.  And they did this, and nobody’s ever — I thought I’ve heard of everything when it comes to that stuff.  No — I’ve never heard of it.  Nobody has ever seen.  So, we sued, and we are in discussions of settlement.\nQ    What would a number be?  Like a hu- — what — what’s a number that you would think would be appropriate?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think it’s a lot.  (Laughter.)\nQ    What’s the timeline and process —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I mean, it — look, it could have — it probably did affect the election.  I mean, we won by a lot.  As I said, “Too big to rig.”  But it probably did affect the election.  Yeah, probably could have won by more, but I could have lost the election because of that.\nIt’s — we have to get to honest elections.  We have to go back to paper ballots.  We have to go back to voter ID.  One-day election, ideally, or short term, not these 48-day and 61-day elections where boxes are put in a room, and, “Oh, let’s move the boxes, because we’re putting in a new air conditioning system.”  Then you see the boxes move, and then you say, “Well, where are all the boxes?”  You know, —\nQ    But would you —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  “What happened to the boxes that never came back?”\nNo, our elections are extremely dishonest.  We’re the only country in the world that has mail-in voting and all of these different things that we put in.  Nobody — no other country in the world has it.\nYou know, France went to — they had some of the things that we had, and they went to same-day voting, all paper.  And, you know, paper is very sophisticated now.  It’s a very sophisticated — it’s a very sophisticated form of voting right now.  It’s a very safe form of voting.\nYou know, the other thing is for the governors.  I wish the governors would do it, because the paper ballots will cost 9 percent of the machines, and they’re 100 percent.  You know, they’re — I don’t — nothing’s foolproof, but they’re as close as you get.  So, we’ll see what happens.\nBut on the “60 Minute” thing, nobody’s ever seen anything like it.\nQ    And would you link the FCC action to the litigation?  I mean, does it make se- —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t think it’s linked, but probably the lawyers look at it, you know, because I know it’s going along.  FCC is headed by a very competent person, and you have some very competent people on the board, and so I think they’re looking at it very seriously.\nYeah.\nQ    Mr. President —\nQ    Sir, of all the deals that you’ve done in your life, all the people you’ve sat across from and negotiated with, is President Putin distinct in any way?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s a very smart guy.  He’s a very cunning person.  But I’ve dealt with some people that — I’ve dealt with some really bad people.  But I will tell you, as far as this is concerned, we’ve — you have to understand, he was — he had no intention, in my opinion, of settling this war.  I think he wanted the whole thing.\nWhen I got elected, we spoke, and I think we’re going to have a deal.  I can’t guarantee you that.  You know, a deal is a deal.  Lots of crazy things happen in deals, right?  But I think we’re going to have a deal.\nIf I didn’t get elected, I believe he would have just continued to go through Ukraine, and over a period of time, a lot of people — a lot of people would have been killed.  It would have lasted for a period of time.\nAnd the reason that Ukraine — and I give — I have great respect for the Ukraine as fighters.  They have great fighters.  But without our equipment, that war would have been over, like people said, in a very short period of time.\nQ    Is there a timeline (inaudible) —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And if you remember, I gave the Javelins, and the Javelins are the things that knocked out those tanks right at the beginning of the war.  They said that — that Obama, at the time, gave sheets, and Trump gave Javelins.  Well, I was the one that did that.  But I want to see it come to an end.\nQ    Will he have to make concessions — President Putin?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, he will.  He will.  He’s going to have to.  And —\nQ    Can you preview that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And I think — I believe that, because we got elected, that war will come to an end.  And I also believe, if we didn’t get elected, if this administration didn’t win the election by a lot, that that war would go on for a long time, and he would want to take the whole thing.\nQ    What concessions?  What concessions?\nQ    On the — on the —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  The big question I had is: Does he want to take the whole thing?  But the reason — and — and the Ukrainians are good fighters, I have to say, but without the equipment — without our equipment — we have the best equipment in the world.  We have the best military equipment in the world.  Without our equipment, that would have been over very quickly.\nQ    What concessions would you like to see?\nQ    On the (inaudible), sir?  On — on the —\nQ    What concessions would you like to see?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I don’t want to tell right now.  But I can tell you that NATO, you can forget about.  That’s been — I think that’s probably the reason the whole thing started.  And I think, JD, we can say that.\nWhat — do you have a statement on that?  You’ve been very much involved.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I gave him the beauty.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  You gave me the — the hardest question, sir.\nQ    Concessions from Russia.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  I mean, look, as the president said, we’re not going to do the negotiation in public with the American media.  He’s going to do it in private with the president of — of Russia, with the president of Ukraine, and with other leaders.  And I think that’s how this has to go.\nI think the — I just want to push back against some of the criticism I’ve seen in the administration on this, because every single time the president engages in diplomacy, you guys preemptively accuse him of conceding to Russia.  He hasn’t conceded anything to anyone.  He’s doing the job of a diplomat, and he is, of course, the diplomat in chief as the president of the United States.\nQ    On the gold cards, sir.  Can you talk a little bit more about the vetting process, you know —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They’ll go through a process.  The process is being worked out right now, and we’re going to be — we’re going to be very careful.\nQ    And will there be restrictions on, for instance, can Chinese nationals get one?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, we’re not going to restrict.\nQ    Can Iranian nationals get —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’re probably not going to be restricting too much in — in terms of countries, but maybe in terms of individuals.  We want to make sure we have people that love our country and are capable of loving the country.\nQ    Is there a process, sir —\nQ    Mr. President, there is a measles outbreak in Texas at the moment in which a child is reported to have died.  Do you have concerns about that?  And have you asked Secretary Kennedy to look into that outbreak?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, why don’t we — Bobby, do you want to speak on that, please?\nSECRETARY KENNEDY:  We are following the measles epidemic every day.  I think there’s 124 people who have contracted measles at this point, mainly in Gaines County, Texas; mainly, we’re told, in the Mennonite community.\nThere are two people who have died, but the — we’re watching it.  And there — there are about 20 people hospitalized, mainly for quarantine.\nWe’re watching it.  We put out a post on it yesterday, and we’re going to continue to follow it.\nQ    Mr. President —\nSECRETARY KENNEDY:  Inci- — incidentally, there have been four measles outbreaks this year in this country.  Last year, there were 16.  So, it’s not unusual.  We have measles outbreaks every year.\nQ    You sound a little under the weather yourself right now.  Are you all right?\nSECRETARY KENNEDY:  I just — I have a permanently bad throat.\nQ    (Inaudible) coughing.\nQ    Mr. President, would you — would you send U.S. peacekeepers to just — to support the — the European peacekeepers?  Would you do any sort of U.S. —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, we’re going to support Europe, yeah.\nQ    And how would we do that?  How would the United States do that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’re very friendly with Europe.  We have a great relationship with Europe.  I mean, you could ask — you could talk about France.  You could talk about any of them.  Yeah, we have a great relationship with Europe.\nQ    But how will we — how will the United States do that?  Would there be boots on —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, how?  I mean, you’re asking me a question: What are we doing in the — let’s worry — I hope we have that problem, where we can worry about peacekeeping.  We got to get there first.\n(Secretary Lutnick knocks on the table.)\nBut I hope we have the problem of worrying about peacekeeping.  That’ll be the easiest problem, I think, JD, that we’ve ever had.  (Laughter.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  I think so, sir.\nQ    That would be part of the deal, presumably, that the Ukrainians —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’ll — we’re —\nQ    — would want —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’ll do it at the time, but we’ll — peacekeeping is very easy.  It’s making the deal that’s very tough.\nAnd, again, nobody was speaking to Russia at all.  And, you know, probably a million and a half soldiers have been killed — close to a million and a half soldiers, not to mention a treme- — I will tell you, the — the thing with that horrible war that should have never started — it would have never started if I were president, and it didn’t start for four years, and it was not even thought about starting.  But the thing with that war is that you’re highly underestimating the number of people that have been killed.  Far more people have been killed in that war than you talk about.  You know, you like to talk about numbers, like, a million people.  Well, they had much more than a million soldiers killed.\nBut you have a lot of cities that have been knocked to the ground.  They’re demolition sites.  Literally, demolition sites.  Every single building is knocked to the ground, and a lot of people were killed in those buildings.  And you’ll hear a report, “Two people were minorly injured” or “just injured a little bit.”  No.  No.  People were killed by the thousands.\nAnd there are a lot more people killed in that war than the media wants to talk about, because Biden did a horrible, horrible job.  He should have prevented that war.  He could have prevented that war.\nPutin would have never gone in.  I’ll tell you one thing: He would have never gone in.  That war would never have taken place if I were president.\nQ    I think what people are trying to understand, Mr. President —\nQ    Mr. President —\nQ    — is how would the United States — what would you be willing to do to support this European peacekeeping effort?  Would there be —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Again, you’re asking me the same question?  (Laughter.)\nQ    I’m just trying —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  How many times do you have to answer it?  You’re talking about after we make peace.  Let me make peace first.\nOnce we make peace, I’ll give you all the answers you want.  But how many times can you ask the same question?\nQ    Mr. President, on the Middle East.  Did you receive —\nQ    Is loosening the sanctions on —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, go ahead.  Behind.\nQ    Is loosening the sanctions on Russia a potential option as part of an overall deal?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Not now, no.  No.  We have sanctions on Russia.  No, I want to see if we make a deal first.  But I think we will.  I’ve had very —\nQ    But is it a bargaining chip, I’m asking.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’ve had very good conversations with President Putin.  I’ve had very good conversations with President Zelenskyy.  And until four weeks ago, nobody had conversations with anybody.  It wasn’t even a consideration.  Nobody thought you could make peace.  I think you can.\nQ    Mr. President, just —\nQ    But if Mr. Putin gets to keep his —\nQ    — just to bring this —\nQ    — the land that was claimed by force, if the Russians get to keep the territory that they — they claimed by force, doesn’t that send a dangerous message, let’s say, to China about Taiwan?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, okay.  You try and take it away, right?  We’re going to do the best we can.  (Laughter.)  We’re going to do the best we can to make the best deal we can for both sides.  But for Ukraine, we’re going to try very hard to make a good deal so that they can get as much back as possible.  We want to get as much back as possible.\nQ    Mr. President, just to bring this full —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And we’ll — we’ll cut it out after maybe this question.  Go ahead.\nQ    To bring this full circle, back to —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Unless it’s a bad question, and then we’ll (inaudible).  (Laughter.)\nQ    And back to —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You always like to finish on a good one.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  But, sir, they want you to negotiate with them instead of President Putin.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I know.  I know.\nQ    Back to the question about the —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They want to continue to talk about the peacekeepers.  (Laughter.)  They’re — you have a lot of confidence in us, because you assume there’s going to be peace.  You know, it’s possible it doesn’t work out.  There is possibility.\nQ    And I had —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But I hope it does, for the sake of humanity, because if you look at the pictures that I’ve looked at, you don’t want to look at them.      Go ahead.\nQ    I had a question back on these cuts to the federal workforce.  You mentioned you — you’re interested in doing another round of this email.  When would you like to\nsee that?  What would be the deadline?  And —     THE PRESIDENT:  I — I’m not — I think —     Q    — this time, would it be mandatory?     THE PRESIDENT:  I think Elon — I think Elon wants to.  And I think it’s a good idea because, you know, those people, as I said before, they’re on the bubble.  You got a lot of people that have not responded, so we’re trying to figure out, do they exist?  Who are they?  And it’s possible that a lot of those people will be actually fired.\nQ    And —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And if that happened, that’s okay, because that’s what we’re trying to do.      This country has gotten bloated and fat and disgusting and incompetently run.\nI think we had the worst president in the history of our country.  He just left office.  I think he’s a disgrace.  What he’s done to our country by allowing millions of people to come into our country like that and all of the other things — the inflation, which he caused because of energy and stupid spending.  To spend hundreds of millions, trillions and trillions of dollars on the Green New Scam — a total scam.  I have the best energy people, the best environmental people in the world around this table, and they — they can’t even believe he got away with it.\nAnd then, in leaving office, to send $20 billion here and $20 million there and $10 million and $5 million, and they couldn’t spend the money fast enough, and “Let’s get it out before Trump gets in.  Let’s just get it out to anybody.”  This is a disgrace to our nation.\nAnd you don’t write the fair thing.  But, look, you know the good news?  The people see it, and that’s why we won the election by so much.      Thank you very much, everybody.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  Thank you.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Doug.  Pulitzer Prize.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Sir, how many peacekeepers are you going to send to — (laughter) —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  “What will you do?”  “How will it be?”  (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY LUTNICK:  “How will you address this?”                                END            12:47 P.M.

the agency’s covered contracts and grants, along with a brief, written justification for each payment submitted by the agency employee who approved the payment.  This system shall include a mechanism for the Agency Head to pause and rapidly review any payment for which the approving employee has not submitted a brief, written justification within the technological system.\n(i)   Once the system described in subsection (a) of this section is in place, the Agency Head shall issue guidance, in consultation with the agency’s DOGE Team Lead, to require that the relevant agency employee promptly submit a brief, written justification prior to that employee’s approval of a payment under covered contracts and grants, subject to any exceptions the Agency Head deems appropriate.\n(ii)  To the

all payment justifications provided pursuant to that process, to the extent consistent with law.\n(e)  Non-Essential Travel Justification.  Each Agency Head shall, with assistance from the agency’s

accurate inventory of real property subject to the agency’s administration.\n(ii)   Real Property Leases.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, each Agency Head shall promptly identify all termination rights the Agency Head may have under existing leases of Government-owned real property and, in consultation with agency’s DOGE Team Lead and the Administrator of General Services or his

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:      Section 1.  Purpose.  During my first term, my Administration took historic steps to correct a fundamental wrong within the American healthcare system.  For far too long, prices were hidden from patients and employers, with inadequate recourse available to individuals looking to shop for care or obtain pricing information from a healthcare provider in advance of a visit or procedure.  These opaque pricing arrangements allowed powerful entities, such as hospitals and insurance companies, to operate with insufficient accountability regarding their pricing practices, resulting in patients, employers, and taxpayers shouldering the burden of inflated healthcare costs.       Pursuant to Executive Order 13877 of June 24, 2019 (Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First), my Administration issued paradigm-shifting regulations to put patients first by requiring hospitals and health plans to deliver meaningful price information to the American people.  These regulations require hospitals to maintain a consumer-friendly display of pricing information for up to 300 shoppable services and a machine-readable file with negotiated rates for every single service the hospital provides; health plans to post their negotiated rates with providers as well as their out-of-network payments to providers and the actual prices they or their pharmacy benefit manager pay for prescription drugs; and health plans to maintain a consumer-facing internet tool through which individuals can access price information.      One economic analysis from 2023 estimated the impact of these regulations, if fully implemented, could result in as much as $80 billion in healthcare savings for consumers, employers, and insurers by 2025.  Another report from 2024 suggested healthcare price transparency could help employers reduce healthcare costs by 27 percent across 500 common healthcare services.  Recent data has found the top 25 percent of most expensive healthcare service prices have dropped by 6.3 percent per year following the initial implementation of price transparency during my first term.       Unfortunately, progress on price transparency at the Federal level has stalled since the end of my first term.  Hospitals and health plans were not adequately held to account when their price transparency data was incomplete or not even posted at all.  The Biden Administration failed to take sufficient steps to fully enforce my Administration’s requirement that would end the opaque nature of drug prices by ensuring health plans publicly post the true prices they pay for prescription drugs.      The American people deserve better.  Making America healthy again will require empowering individuals with the best information possible to inform their life and healthcare choices.  By building on the historic efforts of my first term, my Administration will make more meaningful price information available to patients to support a more competitive, innovative, affordable, and higher quality healthcare system.          Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to put patients first and ensure they have the information they need to make well-informed healthcare decisions.  The Federal Government will continue to promote universal access to clear and accurate healthcare prices and will take all necessary steps to improve existing price transparency requirements; increase enforcement of price transparency requirements; and identify opportunities to further empower patients with meaningful price information, potentially including through the expansion of existing price transparency requirements.      Sec. 3.  Fulfilling the Promise of Radical Transparency.  The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take all necessary and appropriate action to rapidly implement and enforce the healthcare price transparency regulations issued pursuant to Executive Order 13877, including, within 90 days of the date of this order, action to:     (a)  require the disclosure of the actual prices of items and services, not estimates;      (b)  issue updated guidance or proposed regulatory action ensuring pricing information is standardized and easily comparable across hospitals and health plans; and     (c)  issue guidance or proposed regulatory action updating enforcement policies designed to ensure compliance with the transparent reporting of complete, accurate, and meaningful data.     Sec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:           (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or           (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.      (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.      (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n"

and\n(vi)   derivative products.\n(b)  In conducting the investigation described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Commerce shall assess the factors set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), labeled “Domestic production for national defense; impact of foreign competition on economic welfare of domestic industries,” as well as other relevant factors, including:\n(i)     the current and projected demand for copper in United States defense, energy, and critical infrastructure sectors;\n(ii)    the extent to which domestic production, smelting, refining, and recycling can meet demand;\n(iii)   the role of foreign supply chains, particularly from major exporters, in meeting United States demand;\n(iv)    the concentration of United States copper imports from a small number of suppliers and the associated risks;\n(v)     the impact of foreign government subsidies, overcapacity, and predatory trade practices on United States industry competitiveness;\n(vi)    the economic impact of artificially suppressed copper prices due to dumping and state-sponsored overproduction;\n(vii)   the potential for export restrictions by foreign nations, including the ability of foreign nations to weaponize their control over refined copper supplies;\n(viii)  the feasibility of increasing domestic copper mining, smelting, and refining capacity to reduce import reliance; and\n(ix)    the impact of current trade policies on domestic copper production and whether additional measures, including tariffs or quotas, are necessary to protect national security.\nSec. 3.  Required Actions.  (a)  The Secretary of Commerce shall consult with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Energy, and the heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies as determined by the Secretary of Commerce to evaluate the national security risks associated with copper import dependency.\n(b)  Within 270 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit a report to the President that includes:\n(i)    findings on whether United States dependence on copper imports threatens national security;\n(ii)   recommendations on actions to mitigate such threats, including potential tariffs, export controls, or incentives to increase domestic production; and\n(iii)  policy recommendations for strengthening the United States copper supply chain through strategic investments, permitting reforms, and enhanced recycling initiatives.\nSec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nFebruary 25, 2025.\n"

Trump.\nApple’s $500 billion investment: Apple CEO Tim Cook announced today that the company will invest $500 billion in the United States over the next four years amid President Trump’s tariffs push. The historic venture, which comes following Cook’s meeting with President Trump last week, will result in 20,000 new U.S.-based jobs and was immediately hailed as a “landmark” step in bringing back U.S. manufacturing.\nIt’s another watershed moment in President Trump’s commitment to usher in the new Golden Age of America. In just over a month, President Trump has announced a $500 billion private sector investment for the largest artificial intelligence infrastructure project in history, a commitment by Saudi Arabia to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, a $20 billion investment by DAMAC Properties to build new U.S.-based data centers, a pledge by Taiwan to boost U.S.-based investment, and a major investment by Nippon Steel.

In President Trump’s first month back in office, illegal border crossings hit lows not seen in decades — down 94% over last year, while interior arrests are up 137%.\nPromises made, promises kept."

    "content": "MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY         THE SECRETARY OF STATE         THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE         THE ATTORNEY GENERAL         THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE         THE SECRETARY OF LABOR         THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY         THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY         THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY         THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET         THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE         THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE         THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS         THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY         THE ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR NATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS         THE DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\nSUBJECT:       America First Investment Policy  By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:          Section 1.  Principles and Objectives.  America’s investment policy is critical to our national and economic security.  Welcoming foreign investment and strengthening the United States’ world-leading private and public capital markets will be a key part of America’s Golden Age.  The United States has the world’s most attractive assets, in technology and across our economy, and we will make it easier for our overseas allies to support United States jobs, United States innovators, and United States economic growth with their capital.          Investment by United States allies and partners can create hundreds of thousands of jobs and significant wealth for the United States.  Our Nation is committed to maintaining the strong, open investment environment that benefits our economy and our people, while enhancing our ability to protect the United States from new and evolving threats that can accompany foreign investment.          Investment at all costs is not always in the national interest, however.  Certain foreign adversaries, including the People’s Republic of China (PRC), systematically direct and facilitate investment in United States companies and assets to obtain cutting-edge technologies, intellectual property, and leverage in strategic industries.  The PRC pursues these strategies in diverse ways, both visible and concealed, and often through partner companies or investment funds in third countries.           Economic security is national security.  The PRC does not allow United States companies to take over their critical infrastructure, and the United States should not allow the PRC to take over United States critical infrastructure.  PRC-affiliated investors are targeting the crown jewels of United States technology, food supplies, farmland, minerals, natural resources, ports, and shipping terminals.          The PRC is also increasingly exploiting United States capital to develop and modernize its military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses, which poses significant risk to the United States homeland and Armed Forces of the United States around the world.  Related actions include the development and deployment of dual-use technologies, weapons of mass destruction, advanced conventional weapons, and malicious cyber‑enabled actions against the United States and its people.  Through its national Military-Civil Fusion strategy, the PRC increases the size of its military-industrial complex by compelling civilian Chinese companies and research institutions to support its military and intelligence activities.          Those Chinese companies also raise capital by:  selling to American investors securities that trade on American and foreign public exchanges; lobbying United States index providers and funds to include these securities in market offerings; and engaging in other acts to ensure access to United States capital and accompanying intangible benefits.  In this way, the PRC exploits United States investors to finance and advance the development and modernization of its military.          Sec. 2.  Policy.  (a)  It is the policy of the United States to preserve an open investment environment to help ensure that artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies of the future are built, created, and grown right here in the United States.  Investment in our economy from our allies and partners, some of whom have tremendous sovereign wealth funds, supports the national interest.  My Administration will make the United States the world’s greatest destination for investment dollars, to the benefit of all of us.           (b)  Yet for investment in United States businesses involved in critical technology, critical infrastructure, personal data, and other sensitive areas, restrictions on foreign investors’ access to United States assets will ease in proportion to their verifiable distance and independence from the predatory investment and technology-acquisition practices of the PRC and other foreign adversaries or threat actors.          (c)  The United States will create an expedited “fast-track” process, based on objective standards, to facilitate greater investment from specified allied and partner sources in United States businesses involved with United States advanced technology and other important areas.  This process will allow for increased foreign investment subject to appropriate security provisions, including requirements that the specified foreign investors avoid partnering with United States foreign adversaries.            (d)  My Administration will also expedite environmental reviews for any investment over $1 billion in the United States.          (e)  The United States will reduce the exploitation of public and private sector capital, technology, and technical knowledge by foreign adversaries such as the PRC.  The United States will establish new rules to stop United States companies and investors from investing in industries that advance the PRC’s national Military-Civil Fusion strategy and stop PRC-affiliated persons from buying up critical American businesses and assets, allowing only those investments that serve American interests.          (f)  The United States will use all necessary legal instruments, including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), to restrict PRC-affiliated persons from investing in United States technology, critical infrastructure, healthcare, agriculture, energy, raw materials, or other strategic sectors.  My Administration will protect United States farmland and real estate near sensitive facilities.  It will also seek, including in consultation with the Congress, to strengthen CFIUS authority over “greenfield” investments, to restrict foreign adversary access to United States talent and operations in sensitive technologies (especially artificial intelligence), and to expand the remit of “emerging and foundational” technologies addressable by CFIUS.          (g)  To reduce uncertainty for investors, reduce administrative burden, and increase Government efficiency, my Administration will cease the use of overly bureaucratic, complex, and open-ended “mitigation” agreements for United States investments from foreign adversary countries.  In general, mitigation agreements should consist of concrete actions that companies can complete within a specific time, rather than perpetual and expensive compliance obligations.  More administrative resources, in turn, will be directed toward facilitating investments from key partner countries.          (h)  The United States will continue to welcome and encourage passive investments from all foreign persons.  These include non-controlling stakes and shares with no voting, board, or other governance rights and that do not confer any managerial influence, substantive decisionmaking, or non-public access to technologies or technical information, products, or services.  This will allow our cutting-edge businesses to continue to benefit from foreign investment capital, while ensuring protection of our national security.          (i)  The United States will also use all necessary legal instruments to further deter United States persons from investing in the PRC’s military-industrial sector.  These may include the imposition of sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) through the blocking of assets or through other actions, including actions pursuant to Executive Order 13959 of November 12, 2020 (Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies), as amended by Executive Order 13974 of January 13, 2021 (Amending Executive Order 13959 — Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies) and Executive Order 14032 of June 3, 2021 (Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Certain Companies of the People’s Republic of China), and actions pursuant to Executive Order 14105 of August 9, 2023 (Addressing United States Investments in Certain National Security Technologies and Products in Countries of Concern).  Executive Order 14105 is under review by my Administration, pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy), to examine whether it includes sufficient controls to address national security threats.          (j)  This review will build on measures taken under my authority in 2020 and 2021 and consider new or expanded restrictions on United States outbound investment in the PRC in sectors such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum, biotechnology, hypersonics, aerospace, advanced manufacturing, directed energy, and other areas implicated by the PRC’s national Military-Civil Fusion strategy.  Covered sectors should be reviewed and updated regularly, including by the Office of Science and Technology Policy.  As part of the review, my Administration will consider applying restrictions on investment types including private equity, venture capital, greenfield investments, corporate expansions, and investments in publicly traded securities, from sources including pension funds, university endowments, and other limited-partner investors.  It is past time for American universities to stop supporting foreign adversaries with their investment decisions, much as they should stop granting university access to supporters of terrorism.          (k)  To further reduce incentives for United States persons to invest in our foreign adversaries, we will review whether to suspend or terminate the 1984 United States-The People’s Republic of China Income Tax Convention.  That tax treaty, along with the PRC’s admission to the World Trade Organization and the related undertaking by the United States to accord unconditional Most Favored Nation treatment to goods and services of the PRC, led to the deindustrialization of the United States and the technological modernization of the PRC military.  We will seek to reverse both those trends.  United States investors will invest in the future of America, not the future of the PRC.          (l)  To protect the savings of United States investors and channel them into American growth and prosperity, my Administration will also:          (i)    determine if adequate financial auditing standards are upheld for companies covered by the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act;          (ii)   review the variable interest entity and subsidiary structures used by foreign-adversary companies to trade on United States exchanges, which limit the ownership rights and protections for United States investors, as well as allegations of fraudulent behavior by these companies; and          (iii)  restore the highest fiduciary standards as required by the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, seeking to ensure that foreign adversary companies are ineligible for pension plan contributions.          Sec. 3.  Implementation.  The policy set forth in section 2 of this memorandum shall be implemented, to the extent permitted by law and available appropriations, and subject to internal programmatic and budgetary processes, as follows:          (a)  With respect to sections 2(a) through 2(k) of this memorandum, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies) as deemed appropriate by the Secretary of the Treasury, and with respect to the authorities of CFIUS in coordination with the members thereof, shall take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, to support all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, and other statutes to carry out the purposes of this memorandum.          (b)  With respect to section 2(d) of this memorandum, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the heads of other agencies as appropriate, shall carry out the purposes of this memorandum.          (c)  With respect to section 2(l)(i) of this memorandum, the Secretary of the Treasury shall engage as appropriate with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; with respect to section 2(l)(ii) of this memorandum, the Attorney General, in coordination with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall provide a written recommendation on the risk posed to United States investors based on the auditability, corporate oversight, and evidence of criminal or civil fraudulent behavior for all foreign adversary companies currently listed on domestic exchanges; and with respect to section 2(l)(iii) of this memorandum, the Secretary of Labor shall publish updated fiduciary standards under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 for investments in public market securities of foreign adversary companies.          Sec. 4.  Definition.  For purposes of this memorandum, the term “foreign adversaries” includes the PRC, including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macau Special Administrative Region; the Republic of Cuba; the Islamic Republic of Iran; the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea; the Russian Federation; and the regime of Venezuelan politician Nicolás Maduro.          Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:                  (i.) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or                  (ii.) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.         (b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.          (c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n"

Trump has a track record of protecting American manufacturers and empowering American innovators and workers.\n- During his first administration, President Trump initiated Section 301 cases against DSTs and negotiated platinum-standard rules for digital trade with Japan and separately through the USMCA.\n- President Trump demonstrated in his first term that punitive measures like tariffs strengthened the U.S. economy and brought back American industry.\n- Just last week, President Trump announced the “Fair and Reciprocal Plan” on trade to restore fairness in U.S. trade relationships and counter non-reciprocal trade agreements.\n- On Day One, President Trump initiated his America First Trade Policy to make America’s economy great again."

and      (d)  Any other act, policy, or practice of a foreign government that serves to undermine the global competitiveness of United States companies.\nSec. 3.  Agency Responsibilities.  (a)  The United States Trade Representative shall determine, in accordance with applicable law, whether to renew investigations under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411) of the DSTs of France, Austria, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, which were initiated under my Administration on July 16, 2019, and June 5, 2020.  If the United States Trade Representative determines to renew such investigations, he shall take all appropriate and feasible action in response to those DSTs.     (b)  The United States Trade Representative shall determine, consistent with section 302(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2412(b)) (section 302(b)), whether to investigate the DST of any other country that may discriminate against United States companies or burden or restrict United States commerce.  He shall further determine whether to pursue a panel under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on the DST imposed by Canada and whether to investigate Canada’s DST under section 302(b).  In making these determinations, the United States Trade Representative shall consult with the Secretary of the Treasury, as appropriate.      (c)  The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative shall jointly identify trade and other regulatory practices by other countries, including, without limitation, those described in section 2 of this memorandum, that discriminate against, disproportionately affect, or otherwise undermine the global competitiveness or intended operation of United States companies, in the digital economy and more generally, and recommend to me appropriate actions to counter such practices under applicable authorities.  The United States Trade Representative shall include the results of this review as part of the report required in section 5(c) of the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy) (America First Trade Policy Memorandum).      (d)  The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative shall investigate whether any act, policy, or practice of any country in the European Union or the United Kingdom has the effect of requiring or incentivizing the use or development of United States companies’ products or services in ways that undermine freedom of speech and political engagement or otherwise moderate content, and recommend appropriate actions to counter such practices under applicable authorities.  The United States Trade Representative shall include the results of this review as part of the report required in section 5(c) of the America First Trade Policy Memorandum.      (e)  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, shall determine whether any foreign country subjects United States citizens or companies, including, without limitation, in the digital economy, to discriminatory or extraterritorial taxes, or has any tax measure in place that otherwise undermines the global competitiveness of United States companies, is inconsistent with any tax treaty of the United States, or is otherwise actionable under section 891 of title 26, United States Code, or other tax-related legal authority.  The Secretary of the Treasury shall include the results of this determination as part of the report required in section 2 of the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) Global Tax Deal).      (f)  The United States Trade Representative shall identify tools the United States can use to secure among trading partners a permanent moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions.  The United States Trade Representative shall include the results of this review as part of the report required in section 5(c) of the America First Trade Policy Memorandum.      (g)  The United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Senior Counselor to the President for Trade and Manufacturing, shall establish a process that allows American businesses to report to the United States Trade Representative foreign tax or regulatory practices that disproportionately harm United States companies.      Sec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:           (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or           (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.      (b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.      (c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.     (d)  The United States Trade Representative is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register."

    "content": "1:05 P.M. EST      MS. LEAVITT:  Hello.  Good afternoon, everybody.  I brought some heavy hitters in here with me today.  Today marks one month of President Trump’s return to the Oval Office, and there is no denying this administration is off to a historic start.  The President has already signed 73 executive orders.  That is more than double the number signed by Joe Biden and more than quadruple the number signed by Barack Obama over the same period. These executive orders have ended burdensome regulations; sealed the border; unleashed our domestic energy sector; eliminated divisive DEI from our federal government; stopped the weaponization of government; cut waste, fraud, and abuse; reinstituted “America First” trade and foreign policies; and ultimately restored common sense.  The President also signed the Laken Riley Act into law, which ensures ICE will detain illegal aliens arrested or charged with theft or violence.  As of today, the Senate has already confirmed 18 Cabinet-level nominees, which is more than at this point under the Obama administration in 2009 and more than double the pace of the Biden administration in 2021.  And today, we expect Kash Patel to be confirmed as the next director of the FBI.  We are proud to announce that the president will host his first official Cabinet meeting here at the White House next Wednesday, February 26th.  In just four weeks, President Trump has already hosted the leaders of Israel, Japan, Jordan, and India.  And next Monday, the President will host France’s President, Emmanuel Macron, and on Thursday, the UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, will visit the White House as well.  As you all know, over the past month, the President has taken questions from the press — all of you — nearly every single day, sometimes on multiple different occasions in the same day, on any topic any of you wish to talk about.  President Trump set the tone on this approach immediately when he took more than 12 times the questions in his first few hours in office as Joe Biden did in his entire first week.  Yesterday, we hosted a local media row here at the White House with television and radio stations from across the country that reached up to 60 million viewers and listeners.  In our ongoing pursuit of transparency, on this one-month celebration, I am thrilled to bring three of my colleagues and our policy experts here at the White House to further recap this incredible first month of accomplishments in greater detail. We have Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller; the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett; and our National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz.  I will hand it over to them.  They will deliver brief remarks on the accomplishments of this administration in the first month, and then we will open it up to Q and A.  When we open up the Q and A portion, I do ask, for the sake of efficiency in this room, that you direct your question to the principal you seek an answer from.  And I will call on you in this room. But first I will let them roll through their remarks.  And first up, I’ll turn it over to Stephen Miller. MR. MILLER:  Thank you.  It’s great to be back. And I want to just thank you all for joining today our one-month celebration of the most historic opening to a presidency in American history.  No president comes close to what Donald Trump has achieved over just the last 30 days. He has packed eight years of transformative action restoring this nation, restoring our laws, restoring fairness, restoring economic opportunity, restoring national security in just one month.  No one in this country has ever seen anything like it.  And when you look at the consequentiality and the significance and the transformative nature of the actions he’s taking, it truly defies description.  For example, in just one area, this nation has been plagued and crippled by illegal discrimination: diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.  It strangled our economy.  It has undermined public safety.  It has made every aspect of life more difficult, more painful, and less safe.  He has ended all DEI across the federal government.  He has terminated all federal workers involved in promulgating these unlawful policies.  He has ended diversity, equity, and inclusion in all federal contracting.  He has restored merit as the cornerstone of all federal policy; restored the full, fair, impartial enforcement of our federal civil rights laws for the first time in generations; and he has cracked down on individuals across this government and nonprofits who have engaged in illegal racial discrimination against the American people.  This includes making clear to every educational institution in this country that ending diversity, equity, and inclusion, ending unlawful race discrimination is a precondition of receiving federal funds.  He has also saved women’s sports by ending the participation of men in women’s sports.  He has ended radical gender ideology across the entire federal government, and he’s pressured the private sector to also end and combat radical gender ideology.  He’s reestablished the scientific and biological truth that there are only two sexes in this country — male and female — that those are biologically based determinations.  They are not based and can never be based on gender identity.  That includes rooting out of the Department of Defense all DEI policies, all critical race theory, all gender madness, and once again having a military that is focused solely and exclusively on readiness, preparedness, and lethality. As I’m sure Kevin will talk about more, of course, he has undertaken a historic cost-cutting effort across the federal government, launching the first-ever Department of Government Efficiency, uncovering corruption on a scale that we never thought imaginable, terminating every single federal worker that we — that we have found to be engaged in the corruption and theft and the waste of taxpayer dollars, and already saving $50 billion in a single year, which over a 10-year period would be $500 billion.  Just think about how vast and enormous that sum is.  Of course, as you all know, he has renamed the Gulf of Mexico to its correct and proper name: the Gulf of America.  He has renamed Mount Denali into Mount McKinley, part of a historic effort to restore patriotism and national pride all across this land.  He has ended the weaponization of the federal government, restored the Department of Justice to its true mission of combating threats to this nation and keeping the American people safe.  He has ended all federal censorship of free speech.  This has been one of the greatest crises that has plagued this nation.  Years and years and years, the federal government violating the First Amendment to take away Americans’ right of free speech — President Trump has ended that.  And he has demanded that all federal workers, all law enforcement cease any effort to intimidate the rights of Americans or to police their speech.  He has also restored the death penalty at the Department of Justice, including for illegal aliens who commit murder, including for those who murder cops, and including for all of those who threaten Americans with heinous acts of violence.  The death penalty is back.  Law and order is back.  The streets are being made safe once again.  On the public health front, he has launched the nation’s first-ever commission — the MAHA Commission — Make America Healthy Again, following the historic confirmation of RFK Jr., to finally uncover the true root causes of the public health crisis in this country, the childhood disease epidemic in this country, the spiraling rates of pediatric cancer and devastating childhood sickness.  He has finally created a situation where the federal heal- — health agencies in this country will be focused on preventing disease, on keeping children from getting sick in the first place, not sentencing them to a lifetime in and out of hospitals, suffering needlessly, when we can find ways to prevent this epidemic of illness.  Then, of course, on homeland security.  Today, it is officially the law of the land at the conclusion of the congressional notification process that six Mexican cartels and two transnational gangs — Tren de Aragua, or TDA, and MS-13 — so eight organizations in total — are now formally designated as foreign terrorist organizations, which means that every single member of those organizations who operates on U.S. soil is now, as a legal matter, a terrorist, and they will be treated as terrorists.  This is a sea change in U.S. policy.  And this means the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, along with the rest of U.S. law enforcement and the Department of Defense, are now operating in a legal reality where these cartels are recognized as terrorists, and there will be a whole-of-government effort to remove these terrorists from our soil and to degrade their ability to threaten or undermine any American security or sovereignty interests. Border crossings since the day he took office are down 95 percent.  I think it’s almost impossible to even describe the scale and scope of that achievement.  President Trump, within days of taking office, cut border crossings 95 percent.  And those few who have dared to cross are being either prosecuted or deported.  They’re either facing significant jail time for trafficking, smuggling, harboring, aiding, impeding, or they’re being immediately removed from our soil.  Either way, at the end of the process, they are going home.  He has reimplemented Remain in Mexico, and he has obtained historic cooperation from foreign countries all around the world in accepting their deportees back.  And he has used the United States military to fully seal the southern border with a historic deployment of both active duty and National Guard troops, resumed the building of infrastructure.  He has opened up Guantanamo Bay, and he’s using military aircraft to carry out deportations all across this country.  And ICE is joining with ATF, DEA, and FBI to carry out the largest deportation operation in American history.  The criminals are going home.  The border is sealed shut.  America is safe, sovereign, proud, and free.  We are a nation that everyone in the world understands all across this planet: You do not come here illegally.  You will not get in.  You will go to jail.  You will go home.  You will not succeed.  This is the biggest and most successful change in any area of law enforcement that this nation has ever seen, and he did it in under one month.  Thank you. MR. HASSETT:  Should I go? MS. LEAVITT:  Yes, yes. MR. HASSETT:  Well, thank you, Karoline.  Thank you, Stephen.  You know, one of the things that President Trump cares most about is job creation.  And it was about seven years ago I had the honor of joining you in this room for the first time, and it looks like we’ve created a lot more jobs in the last month.  Look at how many people are here.  I — my estimate is about 180 but — but I didn’t count.  So, thank you.  It’s really an honor to be back here.  I think that I just want to go over a few things and then hand it off to Mike.  The first thing is that the President has told us to prioritize fighting inflation, and he had to do that because, as you know, President Biden let inflation get completely out of control.  And he did it with policies that made no sense.  They made no sense.  You know, a lot of times, you people say to us — our friends, the journalists — you know, “Why are you doing that?”  But — but, you know, I like to think, “Why did they do that?  Why did they spend so much money and then — why did the Fed print so much money so that we had inflation as high as we’ve ever seen since Jimmy Carter?  So, why did they do that?” So, we’re addressing inflation.  We didn’t have to address it in the first term, because it was always in the 1s, almost always.  But we’re going to get it back there.  And how are we doing it?  Well, we’re doing it with a plan that President Trump and I and others have talked about in the Oval that involves, like, every level of fighting inflation.  First, the macroeconomic level.  We’re cutting spending.  We’re cutting spending in negotiations with people on the Hill.  We’re cutting spending with the advice of our IT consultant, Elon Musk.  And then we’re also looking into supply-side things, like restoring Trump’s tax cuts, maybe even expensing new factories so that there is an explosion of supply.  If you have an explosion of supply and a reduction in government demand, then inflation goes way down.  And then, one of the things that you want to say is “Well, when are you going to see it?”  Well, the first thing that you’ll see when the markets believe that we’re going to get inflation under control is that the 10-year Treasury rate goes down, because that’s how they think about future expected inflation.  And so, we’re still going to see some memory of Biden’s inflation.  It’s not going to go away in a month.  But the 10-year Treasury before the last Consumer Price Index had dropped about 40 basis points.  Forty basis points because markets were optimistic about our ability to fight inflation.  Forty basis points is kind of not a fun thing to say.  I — economists talk that way.  I apologize.  But the way to think about it is, for a typical mortgage, if that affects the mortgage rate, then it’s going to save a typical family buying a house about a thousand bucks a year, and that’s just in our first month.  Okay.  The second thing we’ve done is we’ve had a lot of trade talks.  In fact, I was just meeting a minister from Mexico with Howard Lutnick just a couple of hours ago.  And we’re talking about reciprocal trade, and we’re also talking about the fentanyl crisis.  And so, reciprocal trade is about our government treating other governments the way they treat us.  We want trade to be fair.  It turns out that Americans have been disadvantaged by foreign governments over and over, and President Trump wants it to stop.  And the fact that struck me as most noticeable, when I started to look at what President Trump was asking us to do, is that last year — last year — we have data — U.S. companies paid $370 billion in taxes to foreign governments — $370 billion.  Last year, foreign multinationals paid us $57 billion in taxes.  We have one quarter of world GDP.  They have three quarters of world GDP.  And we’re paying $370.  They’re paying $57.  This is not reciprocal.  We’re going to try — or we’re going to fix it.  The other thing that we’ve done is we’ve had an all-of-the-above energy approach that’s led by Doug Burgum and Chris and a really large team — EPA — and we’ve already made so many actions that are going to affect the price of energy and lower inflation.  We’ve opened up 625 million acres to energy exploration.  We’ve cut 50 years of red tape that makes it so you can’t have permits.  And we’ve even made it so that when you go home, if you get a new one, then you can take a shower or flush a toilet or read under a light bulb.  We’re doing that too.  So — so, finally, let’s just think about, like, the facts that we can see right now that we think are awesome.  So, guess what?  Small-business optimism is — has go- — gone up by the most ever since President Trump came in.  ISM, which is the measure of what’s going on in manufacturing, it’s expanding again for the first time in years.  CEO confidence is the highest it’s been in years.  And the reason — the reason people are thinking this is that our policies give people cause for optimism.  And then I want to reiterate what Stephen Miller said, because it’s so important — and it’s so important for financial markets to start to digest this — that if, say, the Treasury secretary or the — any Cabinet secretary, with Elon Musk, is able to find some savings — say, $100 billion — well, in CBO land, that’s actually, like, about 10 times that or maybe 12 times that over a 10-year window.  And so, when you’re thinking about the negotiations right now over reconciliation and thinking about, well, $4 trillion, $5 trillion, well, those numbers, in terms of the savings, are going to end up being small because of all the waste that we’re finding.  And so, we’re incredibly optimistic about the future of inflation and the future of our economy.  And we’re optimistic because we’re making so much progress so far, and we already see it in market prices.  And, with that, I’ll hand it off to Mike.  MR. WALTZ:  All right.  Thanks, Kevin.  Well, good afternoon.  What a month and what a sea change in our — in our foreign policy.  In addition to what we’re doing on the border and restoring American sovereignty, in addition to what we’re doing in our economy and the job creation and the inflation reduction, we are bringing the world back to where it was at the end of President Trump’s first term, which is a world of peace, prosperity, and — and looking forward and getting us out of the chaos that we’ve just seen over the last four years.  So, over the last month, just to name a few, I had the honor of sitting in the Oval Office as President Trump spoke with President Putin and then immediately spoke with President Zelenskyy, and both of them said only President Trump could bring both sides to the table, and only President Trump could stop the horrific fighting that has been going on now for the better part of four years and that only President Trump could drive the world back to peace.  Both of those leaders said that in back-to-back calls. And, of course, we just had our historic talks mediated by our — our good friends and partners, Saudi Arabia — we give great thanks to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for hosting — and sat down for the first time in years with the Russians and talked about a path forward with peace. On top of that and one of the things that led to that was a tremendous co- — confidence-building measure that we had with the release of Marc Fogel.  I’ll remind everyone, the last time that we had an American released from the Russians, either we gave up a deadly spy; pressured our allies to give up a lethal killer; or we released, under the Biden administration, the world’s most notorious arms dealer, Viktor Bout, who, by the way, had one of his main clients for arms the cartels in — in Mexico and Central America.  We gave up none of that.  This was released as a confidence-building measure, working with our great Middle East Envoy, Steve Witkoff, and our secretary of State as a first step towards opening these talks and then moving forward towards peace.  On top of that, we’ve secured, just in a month, the return of a dozen — 12 — American hostages from Russia, from Bulgaria, from Venezuela, the Taliban, and Hamas.  Excuse me, that’s from Belarus, not Bulgaria.  We also had — for the first time in quite some time, we took out a senior leader of ISIS, an international financier and recruiter that the military had been trying to take out for quite some time and — and wasn’t able to do so, frankly, because of a bureaucratic approval process.  President Trump said, “Take him out.”  And that ISIS financier and leader is no longer on this Earth.  We’ve also taken action to eliminate other terrorist organizations in the Middle East.  We drove — before the President was even in office, he started talking consequences for people that would hold Americans.  Heretofore, there’s been nothing but upside.  You take an American, you get some better deal.  You take another one, maybe you get a better deal.  No more.  There is now nothing but downside for taking Americans illegally, either as hostages or illegal detainees.  And when President Trump sent a very clear message across the Middle East, but particularly to Hamas, that there would be all hell to pay, we suddenly saw a breakthrough.  And now we just saw the release of yet another group of hostages.  There have been dozens now, including two Americans that we’ve seen once again reunited with their families.  As part of the talks with King Abdullah, he offered — and — and I think the entire world has graciously accepted — to take 2,000 sick children, cancer patients, and others out of Gaza.  As a humanitarian — as a humanitarian gesture, 2,000 Gazans will come out of that hellhole that it is, that wasteland that Gaza is right now, with unexploded ordnance, with debris everywhere, with no sewage, with no water.  And — and President Trump has — has put forward a plan to deal with the practical reality that is 1.8 million Gazans now — now truly suffering. And then, you know, just to bring it back to our own hemisphere, we’ve seen literally, in the last month — after years of national security experts, the generals in charge, and others testifying and ringing the alarm bells about — about the Chinese Communist Party’s presence in our own hemisphere, particularly in the Panama Canal, we’re seeing the leadership of Panama step away from the Belt and Road program, move away from China and back towards the United States, and even enter into talks and — and other negotiations about addressing the ports on either side of the canal.  And then, finally, last but not least, we’ve had four world leaders in the White House, in the Oval Office.  We’ve had the prime minister of Japan, the prime minister of India, the king of — of Jordan, and, of course, the prime minister of Israel just in the last four weeks.  And next week, we’ll have the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and we’ll have the president of France, Macron.  So, President Trump is on what we call Trump warp speed.  We are all — we are all honored to be really serving under — under his leadership and his vision.  And truly, you know, when we all say — and the President himself say — says, he is a president of peace.  He is a president focused on restoring stability.  I think the entire world saw what the world would look like without strong American leadership in the last four years. And it’s truly been an honor to get us back to where we were and back on track under President Trump’s leadership.  MS. LEAVITT:  Thank you, Mike.  MR. WALTZ:  Mm-hmm. MS. LEAVITT:  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  I’m sure you’re very eager to ask questions of these very smart people working very hard on behalf of the president.  We do have somebody in our new media seat today.  We have John Stoll, who is the head of news at X.  As you all know — you’re all on X — it’s home to hundreds of millions of users, a large contingent of independent journalists and news organizations across geographies and political spectrums.  And at the same time, X remains the go-to platform for many legacy news outlets.  And I know, as I mentioned, many of the reporters in this room use X to attract eyeballs to your work.  Prior to joining X, John spent two decades in journalism, including several years as an editor at The Wall Street Journal.  We are excited to have him in the briefing room today. John, we’ll let you kick it off.  And as I said at the top, please direct your question to the individual up here who you’d like an answer from.  John, why don’t you begin. Q    All right.  Thank you very much.  I am sitting in for a thriving ecosystem of journalists, independent and — and emerging news organizations who do depend on X for publicity, for a business model.  And so, I look forward to seeing many of them in this seat in months and years to come.  I also thank you, Karoline, for opening this seat up to new media.  It — it really is a testament not only to your open-mindedness but also to innovation that you’d actually think about, you know, folks that are not traditionally credentialed to be in this room to be in this room and to not only have a question but also to witness — you know, this is at a very important intersection of power and the free press. And so, just the ability to witness this and — and be part of it, it brings everybody’s game up.  So, thank you for that.  I think this is for Mike Waltz.  My question is about Ukraine. MR. WALTZ:  Sure. Q    For about more than 10 years, I’ve been fascinated, like all — like many, with what’s going on.  I was in Northern Europe working out of the Baltics when Crimea was annexed and was — a lot — a lot of this came on Twitter.  The platform used to be known as Twitter.  Was — a lot of European leaders would — would talk about their disappointment and — and solidarity with Ukraine, but when it came to actually doing something, it felt like they were passing a hot potato and sent it over the Atlantic.  I wonder how much of what we’re seeing right now out of the administration and President Trump is a call to Europe and the European leaders and allies that we’ve traditionally had to pick up that hot potato and — and start doing something a little bit more concrete to win and preserve the peace in Ukraine.  The second question I have is — it — it’s related — is there’s been some — a lot of speculation that President Trump and the administration might be manipulated by Pre- — by Vladimir Putin.  I wonder if you can just talk a little bit about the administration’s posture — MR. WALTZ:  Yeah. Q    — and your confidence in the competence of this administration to d- — go toe to toe with Vladimir Putin.  MR. WALTZ:  Well, if there’s an- — I’ll take the l- — second question first.  If there’s anybody in this world that can go toe to toe with Putin, that could go toe to toe with Xi, that could go toe to toe with Kim Jong Un — and we could keep going down the list — it’s Donald J. Trump.  He is the dealmaker in chief.  There is no question that he is the commander in chief.  And I, for one — and I think all Americans and around the world should have no doubt about his ability to not only handle Putin but to handle the complexity of driving this war to an end.  And then on your first piece on Europe, I’ll take you back to 2014.  You’re right.  There was a lot of hand-wringing in Europe and not a lot of action.  There was also a lot of hand-wringing here in Washington under the Obama administration and not a lot of action.  They literally threw blankets at the problem.  And so, I’ll remind everyone that Putin had, you know, some type of conflict, invasion, or issue with their neighbor under President Bush, with Georgia; under President Obama, with Ukraine in 2014; not under President Trump, 45; and again with President Biden in 2022.  The war should have been deterred.  The war should have never happened, and I have no doubt it would not have happened under President Trump and will stop under President — President Trump again.  But I just want to push back on this notion of our European allies not being consulted as we’ve entered into this process.  I already mentioned the immediate phone call President Trump made to President Zelenskyy.  He has talked to President Macron of France repeatedly last week.  President Macron convened European leaders and then is coming here on Monday.  Prime Minister Starmer is coming next Thursday.  We’ve also — I’ve talked to every one of my national security — national security advisor counterparts across — across the spectrum in Europe.  I’ve talked to Secretary-General Rutte, the — the leader of NATO, the secretary-general of NATO.  We have repeatedly — oh, by the way, we had half our Cabinet — seven Cabinet officials, including the vice president, at the Munich Security Conference, all engaging, all listening, and all making sure our allies were heard.  However, we’ve also made it clear for years — decades, even — that it is unacceptable that the United States and the United States taxpayer continues to bear the burden not only of the cost of the war in Ukraine but of the defense of — of Europe.  We fully support our NATO Allies.  We fully support the Article 5 commitment.  But it’s time for our European allies to step up.  And one of the things that Secretary-General Rutte said on our call was this last couple of weeks have been a real wake-up call.  And I asked him, “What have you been missing the last couple of years?”  The fact that we are going to enter into a NATO summit this June with a third of our NATO Allies still not meeting the 2 percent minimum, a commitment they made a decade ago — literally a decade ago — with a war on their doorstep — the largest war that they’re all extremely concerned about — but yet it’s “Well, somebody else needs to pay.  We’ve got other domestic priorities.”  It’s unacceptable.  President Trump has made that clear.  And the minimum needs to be met.  We need to be at 100 percent in — this June at the NATO summit.  And then let’s talk about exceeding it, which what — is what President Trump has been talking about, with 5 percent of GDP.  Europe needs to step up for their own defense as a partner.  And we can be friends and allies and have those tough conversations.  MS. LEAVITT:  Great.  Peter. Q    Thank you, Karoline.  I have a Ukraine one and a DOGE one.  Who can talk DOGE? MS. LEAVITT:  Stephen, go ahead. Q    Well, so — so, Stephen, we’re hearing about these DOGE dividend checks that would be 20 percent back to taxpayers, 20 percent to pay down the debt.  Sixty percent is left.  Who gets that? MR. MILLER:  Well, the way that it works is when you achieve savings, you can either return it to taxpayers, you can return it to our debtors, or it can be cycled into next year’s budget, and then it just lowers the overall baseline for next year.  So, in other words, you can just transfer it into the next fiscal window and then lower the overall spending level.  And that means that you can achieve a permanent savings that way, and that reduces the deficit.  Q    And when is it that people might see those checks? MR. MILLER:  Well, this is all going to be worked on through the reconciliation process with Congress that’s going underway right now, as you’ve seen.  The Senate is moving a bill.  The House is moving a bill.  The president has great confidence in both chambers to deliver on his priorities.  I would just take this opportunity to note that President Trump has made a historic commitment to the working class of this country to fight for a major tax relief and major price relief.  And cutting spending, as DOGE is doing, and cutting taxes is the key to delivering on both of those promises.  And President Trump is resolutely committed to doing both.  Q    Thank you.  And on Ukraine.  I guess, this is for Mike. MR. WALTZ:  Sure.  Q    After the president’s post on Truth Social yesterday, need to know: Who does he think is more responsible for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin or Zelenskyy? MR. WALTZ:  Well, look, his — his goal, Peter, is to bring this war to an end, period.  And there has been ongoing fighting on both sides.  It is World War I-style trench warfare.  His frustration with President Zelenskyy is — that you’ve heard — is multifold.  One, there needs to be a deep appreciation for what the American people, what the American taxpayer, what President Trump did in — in his first term, and what we’ve done since.  So, some of the rhetoric coming out of Kyiv, frankly, and — and insults to President Trump were unacceptable.  Number one.  Number two, our own secretary of Treasury personally made the trip to offer the Ukrainians what is — can only be described as a historic opportunity — that is for America to coinvest with Ukraine in their minerals, in their resources, to truly grow the pie.  So, case in point, there’s a foundry that processes aluminum in Ukraine.  It’s — it’s been damaged.  It’s not at its current capacity.  If that is restored, it would account for America’s entire imports of aluminum for an entire year — that one foundry. There are tremendous resources there.  Not only is that long-term security for Ukraine, not only do we help them grow the pie with investments, but, you know, we do have an obligation to the American taxpayer in helping them recoup the hundreds of billions that ha- — that have occurred.  So, you know, rather than enter — enter into some constructive conversations about what that deal should be going forward, we got a lot of rhetoric in the media that was — that was incredibly unfortunate.  And I could just tell you, Peter, you know, as a veteran, as somebody who’s been in combat, this war is horrific.  And I think we’ve lost sight of that, of the literally thousands of people that are dying a day, families that are going without the next generation.  And I find it kind of, you know, frankly, ridiculous.  So many people in Washington that were just demanding, pounding the table for a ceasefire in Gaza are suddenly aghast that the president would demand one and both sides come to the table when it talks to — when it comes to Ukraine, a war that has been arguably far greater in — in scope and scale and far more dangerous in terms of global escalation to U.S. security. Q    And I do have one for Karoline. MS. LEAVITT:  Sure. Q    Does President Trump have a bet with Trudeau about this USA-Canada hockey game tonight?  (Laughter.)  And when there is a big hockey game on, is the president watching for the goals or for the fights? MS. LEAVITT:  (Laughs.)  Probably both.  I think he’s watching for the United States to win tonight.  I know he talked to the USA hockey team this morning.  He talked to the players after their morning practice, around 10 o’clock.  And I also spoke to some folks from that team after.  They were jubilant over President Trump’s comments to the team.  I believe they’re going to put out a video of that call.  So, he looks forward to watching the game tonight, and we look forward to the United States beating our soon-to-be 51st state, Canada.  (Laughter.) Bloomberg, go ahead.  Q    My question is for Mike Waltz.  Can you give us a readout of Kellogg’s meeting with Zelenskyy that just wrapped up?  And, in particular, Zelenskyy publicly rejected this deal about the rare earth minerals.  Where — where does that stand? MR. WALTZ:  Well, we’re going to continue to have — he needs to come back to the table, and we’re going to continue to have discussions about where that deal is going.  Again, we have an obligation to the taxpayer.  I think this is an opportunity.  The president thinks this is an opportunity for Ukraine going forward.  There can be, in my view, nothing better for Ukraine’s future and for their security than — than to have the United States invested in their prosperity long-term.  And then a key piece of this has also been security guarantees.  Look, the — the reality that we’re talking about here is: Is it in Ukraine’s interest?  Is it in Europe’s interest?  It certainly isn’t in Russia’s interest or in the American people’s interest for this war to grind on forever and ever and ever.  So, a key part of his conversation was helping President Zelenskyy understand this war needs to come to an end.  This kind of open-ended mantra that we’ve had under the Biden administration, that’s over.  And I think a lot of people are having a hard time accepting that. And then the other piece is there’s been discussions from Prime Minister Starmer and also President Macron about European-led security guarantees.  We welcome that.  We’ve been asking Europe to step up and secure its own prosperity, safety, and security.  So, we certainly welcome that.  And we certainly welcome more European assistance.  As I told my counterparts, “Come to the table with more, if — if you want a bigger seat at the table.”  And we’ve been asking for that for quite some time.  Q    And has Russia pushed for sanctions in your talks with them?  And have you consulted with international partners and allies about potentially rolling back sanctions in these negotiations to end the war? MR. WALTZ:  Those — the talks with — with our Russian counterparts — both with my counterpart, the national security advisor; Secretary Rubio’s counterpart, the Foreign Minister, Foreign Minister Lavrov — you know, it — it really were — was quite broad, focused on what is the goals for our broader relationship, but very clear that the fighting has to stop to get to any of those brighter goals.  And as a first step, we’re just going to do some commonsense things, like restore the — the ability of both of our embassies to function.  And, again, you know, this is — this was common sense.  In — in foreign policy world, they call it “shuttle diplomacy.”  We have to talk to both sides in order to get to both sides to the table, and both sides have said only President Trump could do that.  MS. LEAVITT:  Diana. Q    Thank you.  And my question is for Mike Waltz.  (Laughter.) MR. WALTZ:  All right. Q    The president has called Zelenskyy a dictator.  Does he view Putin as a dictator?  And does he want Zelenskyy out of power?  I know he’s called for elections.  And then, thirdly, the head of the Defense Committee in Ukraine’s parliament just has claimed that the U.S. has stopped selling weapons to Ukraine.  Is that true? MR. WALTZ:  Well, most of our weapons that have gone to Ukraine have been part of a drawdown authority, where we’ve literally taken them out of our stocks and then, eventually, through appropriations, started buying them again to refill our stocks.  I’ll, you know, just state that there has been a lag in a lot of that process.  So, many of our stocks, as we look at our operations around the world, are becoming more depleted.  That’s one of the reasons many people have had a lot of concern about: When does this end?  How much is it going to take?  How many lives will be lost?  How much will we be — how much will we spend?  As a member of Congress, we repeatedly asked the Biden administration those questions, and we never got a satisfactory answer.  Look, President Trump is obviously very frustrated right now with President Zelenskyy — the fact that — that he hasn’t come to the table, that he hasn’t been willing to take this opportunity that we have offered.  I think he eventually will get to that point, and I hope so very quickly. But President Trump is — as we made clear to our Russian counterparts, and I want to make clear today — he’s focused on stopping the fighting and moving forward.  And we could argue all day long about what’s happened in the past.  MS. LEAVITT:  Reagan. Q    Thanks.  I have a question for Stephen — (Cross-talk.) Q    — and a question for Mike. MS. LEAVITT:  Excuse me, I just called on Reagan.  Reagan, go ahead.  Q    I have a question for Stephen and a question for Mike.  MS. LEAVITT:  Sure. Q    Stephen, I can start with you.  There have been reports — MR. MILLER:  Thank you. Q    — that Trump is unhappy with the rate of deportations and he wants them to be higher.  Is the president happy with the rate of deportations, and are there any plans to speed up the process? MR. MILLER:  Well, first of all, we all appreciate the encouragement from the media to deport as many illegal aliens as humanly possible.  So, thank you.  And I will promise you that the full might of the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and every element and instrument of national power will be used to remove, with speed, all criminal illegals from the soil of the United States of America, to enforce final removal orders, and to ensure that this country is for American citizens and those who legally belong in this country. We inherited an ICE that was completely shuttered.  We inherited a Department of Homeland Security whose sole mission was to resettle illegal aliens within the United States of America.  In 30 days, the president sealed the border shut, declared the cartels to be terrorist organizations, has increased ICE deportations to levels not seen in decades, and we are shortly on the verge of achieving a pace and speed of deportations this country has never before seen.  Thank you.  Q    And Mike. MR. WALTZ:  Mm-hmm. Q    There have been reports that there’s some underground opposition to Trump’s pick for Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, Elbridge Colby.  Have you or anyone from the administration been personally lobbying senators to support Elbridge Colby?  MR. WALTZ:  Look, I’ve worked with Bridge Co- — Colby in the past.  He has the president’s full support to be the Undersecretary of policy, which will be a critical policy arm for Secretary Hegseth going forward that will implement a lot of these policies.  And — and really, that’s — that’s been the extent of it.  I think there’s been a lot of kind of, you know, breathless — I don’t know — back-and-forth in the — in the press, but we’re full speed ahead to get the president’s team in place so we can implement his America First policy.  MS. LEAVITT:  Thank you.  Mike has spoken pretty extensively.  Does anybody have questions for Stephen or for Mr. Hassett? Q    I do. MS. LEAVITT:  Nobody wants to talk about the economy?  (Laughter.) (Cross-talk.) MS. LEAVITT:  Sure.  Q    IRS. MS. LEAVITT:  IRS.  Okay.  Go ahead. Q    And this would be for either one of you.  So, we have reported, several other outlets have reported that about 3,500 people are due to be — lose their jobs at the IRS by the end of the week.  If the goal of these spending cuts across the federal government has been to reduce the debt, why impose some of the deepest cuts we’ve seen so far at the agency responsible for raising revenue for the federal government? MR. HASSETT:  Well, I think our objective is to make sure that the employees that we pay are being productive and effective.  And there are many, many — more than 100,000 people working to collect taxes, and not all of them are fully occupied.  And the Treasury secretary is studying the matter and feels like 3,500 is a small number and probably can get bigger, especially as we improve the IT at the IRS. And so — so, I think that it’s absolutely something that is on the table for good reasons.  And the point is that — don’t just talk about the IRS.  Talk about all of government, that there are so many places — I live in D.C.; you maybe live in D.C. — where you never — there — nobody — nobody is going into the buildings.  People aren’t commuting because nobody is doing their job.  We look back and we see that there are all these people doing two jobs while they’re getting a government payroll — on the payroll.  So, the point is, we’re fixing that, and the IRS is a small part of that picture.  Q    So, you’re saying that everybody who’s being let go was doing a bad job?MR. HASSETT:  I’m saying that we’re studying every agency and deciding who to let go and why, and we’re doing so very rationally with a lot of support from analysis.  Q    Because we’re being told by a lot of people who have been let go at other agencies that they were told they were being dismissed because of poor performance, when, in some cases, they haven’t even had a performance review yet because they’ve only been on the job a couple of months.  MR. HASSETT:  Yeah, I’ve never seen a person who was laid off for poor performance say that they were performing poorly.  (Laughter.)  Okay?Q    Karoline. MS. LEAVITT:  Good point.  Sure, Kaitlan. Q    I have a question.  I’ll start with you, Kevin Hassett.  Thank you for being here.  And then I’ve got a question for Mr. Waltz. On these potential checks that you might send out from DOGE, is there a concern, as you’re thinking through this, that they could be inflationary? MR. HASSETT:  Oh, absolutely not, because imagine if we don’t spend government money and we give it back to people, then the — you know, if they spend it all, then you’re even.  But they’re probably going to save a lot of it, in which case, you’re reducing inflation.  Q    Okay.  So, you’re not — MR. HASSETT:  And also, when the government spends a lot, that’s what creates inflation.  We learned that from Joe Biden.  And so, if we reduce government spending, then that’s — you know, reduces inflation.  And if you give people money, then they’re going to save a bunch of it.  And — and when they save it, then that also reduces demand and reduces inflation.  Q    Okay.  So, you’re not worried about it.  MR. HASSETT:  No, I’m not. Q    And, Mr. Waltz, to follow up on Peter’s question, you wrote in an op-ed in the fall of 2023 that, quote, “Putin is to blame, certainly, like al Qaeda was to blame for 9/11.” MR. WALTZ:  Mm-hmm. Q    Do you still feel that way now, or do you share the president’s assessment, as he says Ukraine is to blame for the start of this war? MR. WALTZ:  Well, it shouldn’t surprise you that I share the president’s assessment on all kinds of issues.  What I wrote as a Member of Congress is — was as a former Member of Congress.  Look, what I share the president’s assessment on is that the war has to end.  And what comes with that?  What comes with that should be, at some point, elections.  What comes with that should be peace.  What comes with that is prosperity that we’ve just offered in this natural resources and economic partnership arrangement: an end to the killing and European security and security for the world.  The President is not only determined to do that in Europe, he’s determined to do it in the Middle East.  And just a few months ago, we had an administration that had tried for 15 months, week after week, sitting with you here, and couldn’t get us to a ceasefire, couldn’t get our hostages out.  Now we’re at that point.  We’re back to the maximum pressure on Iran. And we will — we have just begun, and we will drive towards a ceasefire and all of those other steps.  I’m not going to pre-negotiate or get ahead of the sequencing of all of that.  It’s a very delicate situation.  But this is a president of peace.  And who here would argue against peace? Q    Okay.  So, you do share that assessment.  And can I follow up.  In 2017 — MS. LEAVITT:  No.  Go ahead, Jordan. Q    — then-President Trump — MS. LEAVITT:  Go ahead, Jordan.  Q    Can I just follow up really quickly? Q    Thank you.  So — MS. LEAVITT:  You just had two questions, Kaitlan. Q    May I — can I just — MS. LEAVITT:  Jordan, go ahead.  Q    Mr. — Mr. Hassett — MS. LEAVITT:  Thank you. Q    I have an important follow-up for Mike Waltz. MS. LEAVITT:  Jordan, go ahead.  Go ahead. Q    So, Mr. Hassett, you were speaking about tariff revenue, and you also addressed a question about the R- — IRS.  President Trump has spoken about replacing income tax with tariff revenue, especially with all this waste, fraud, and abuse that we’re seeing cut.  Is that a possibility? MR. HASSETT:  Absolutely.  And, in fact, if you think about the China tariff revenue that we’re estimating is coming in from the 10 percent that we just added, plus the de minimis thing, that it’s between $500 billion and a trillion dollars over 10 years, is our estimate.  And that’s something that is outside of the reductions that markets are seeing through the negotiations up on the Hill. And so, we expect that the tariff revenue is actually going to make it much easier for Republicans to pass a bill, and that was the President’s plan all along.  Thank you. Q    And I — I have a question for Stephen Miller about DOGE.  So, you — you spoke about DOGE.  You said roughly $50 billion is set to be cut in a year of waste, fraud, and abuse by unelected bureaucrats.  We’re hearing this ironic narrative from the President’s critics and the left-wing media that Elon Musk is an unelected bureaucrat, and he’s doing all this terrible stuff.  Isn’t one of DOGE’s objectives to get — get rid of the federal bureaucracy, the — the deep state?  And also, who was running the White House when Joe Biden was in office — MR. MILLER:  (Laughs.) Q    — because I don’t know a single person who believes it was Joe Biden?  MR. MILLER:  Yes.  You’re — you’re tempting me to say — (laughs) — some very harsh things about some of our media friends.  The — yes, it is true that many of the people in this room, for four years, failed to cover the fact that Joe Biden was mentally incompetent and was not running the country.  It is also true that many people in this room who have used this talking point that Elon is not elected fail to understand how government works.  So, I’m glad for the opportunity for a brief civics lesson.  A president is elected by the whole American people.  He’s the only official in the entire government that is elected by the entire nation.  Right?  Judges are appointed.  Members of Congress are elected at the district or state level.  Just one man.  And the Constitution, Article Two, has a clause, known as the vesting clause, and it says, “The executive power shall be vested in a president,” singular.  The whole will of democracy is imbued into the elected president.  That president then appoints staff to then impose that democratic will onto the government.  The threat to democracy — indeed, the existential threat to democracy — is the unelected bureaucracy of lifetime, tenured civil servants who believe they answer to no one, who believe they can do whatever they want without consequence, who believe they can set their own agenda no matter what Americans vote for.  So, Americans vote for radical FBI reform, and FBI agents say they don’t want to change.  Or Americans vote for radical reform in our energy policies, but EPA bureaucrats say they don’t want to change.  Or Americans vote to end DEI — racist DEI policies, and lawyers in the Department of Justice say they don’t want to change.  What President Trump is doing is he is removing federal bureaucrats who are defying democracy by failing to implement his lawful orders, which are the will of the whole American people.  Thank you.  Q    Thanks, Stephen.  Can I follow up? Q    Karoline. MS. LEAVITT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  I’m looking at the clock.  We’ve almost had an hour of time.  (Cross-talk.)LEAVITT:  I know a couple of these individuals have a meeting to get to at 2:00 p.m.  So, you’re welcome to follow up with my team for further questions.  We’re going to let these guys get back to running the United States government. And we will see you all later.  President Trump will be speaking at 3 o’clock at the Black History Month reception. So, thank you.  It’s good to see you.  We’ll see you in a bit.  Thanks. Q    Are you going to the Black History Month reception, Mr. Miller? Q    Stephen, on the fraud.  Should we expect indictments? Q    What is your reaction to Mitch McConnell’s retirement? Q    Are there indictments coming for all the fraud we’ve found?      MR. MILLER:  I’d love to follow up with you.  Just set up a time with Karoline.      Q    Okay.  Thank you.  END                   1:56 P.M. EST\n\n"

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  (Applause.)  That’s such a great song.  It’s hard to cut it off, isn’t it?  You know?\nI want to get you home for the hockey game, I guess.  And we’ll get this done real quick — quickly.  And I want to thank you all.  We have so many great friends here.  A lot of great governors, a lot of talent.  I’m thrilled to be with the Republican governors, and they have done an amazing job, and I look forward to working with each and every one of you as we complete the mission of saving America — they left us a real mess, didn’t they, huh? — and making our country great again.  We’re going to do it.  We’ve made a lot of progress.\nWe’re given credit for having the best four weeks that anybody has ever had as an opening, so — (applause).  Now, a few hundred more weeks like this and we’re going to be in great shape.\nBut we’ve had a lot of fun doing it too.  It’s a pleasure to do it.  We just ripped down whatever they’ve done.  It’s almost like I want to just do one executive order: Anything he signed is now terminated.  (Laughter and applause.)  It’s easier than, you know, point after point after point.  I sign and sign.  Just do one: Everything he signed is no good.  Because that’s really what, basically, it’s all about.\nI especially want to thank the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, Brian Kemp, who is fantastic.  (Applause.)  He was fantastic.  We won Georgia by a lot.  Where is Brian?  We won Georgia by a lot.  Where are you, Brian?  There you are.  And we did a great job together, and I appreciate it.  We won’t forget it.  Thank you, Brian.\nAs well as Vice Chairman Greg Gianforte, a friend of mine who has done a fantastic job as governor — (applause) — for organizing this beautiful evening.\nIn addition to — hi, Greg.  How you doing?  Good?  You look good.  (Laughs.)  You look good.\nIn addition to our fantastic governors, we also have Secretaries Doug Burgum and Chris Wright.  They are very important.  (Applause.)  Where are they?  Where are they?  Doug, you were great on television.  Chris.  These two guys are going to do it.  I tell you, if they get the energy bumping, we’ll get that energy price down, and everything is going to follow.  Everything is going to follow, and we’re going to work very, very hard.\nHere’s a gentleman from Virginia that I recognize that we’ve become — (applause) — we almost won that, didn’t we, huh?  We almost won it.  We were just a little bit shy, but I want to thank you for the help.  We did a great job together.\nBut another man that’s with us is really unbelievable, and you’re going to be working him very closely: RNC Chairman Michael Whatley.  (Applause.)  And Michael worked with Lara, and the team of him and Lara were pretty unbeatable, I would say.  She was great and had the victory, and she’s solid.\nThere was no nepotism either.  Nobody said, “Oh, gee.”  They said, “How did you get her?”  And I said to Michael, “So, who would you like to work with?”  “Well, how about Lara again?”  But Lara came — right after we won, she said, “Now, Dad, I want to go home to my family.”  (Laughs.)  She did a great job, and she just wanted to go back home to the family.\nBut what a team that was.  We beat them left and right.  They tried to cheat, but they — (laughs) how many lawyers did you have?  Like, 2,000 lawyers or some crazy number, right?\nPARTICIPANT:  Six thousand five hundred.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Six thousand five hundred lawyers.  I would say that’s a lot.  And the reason I picked him is because, with North Carolina, in 2020 — we did so great in 2020.  But the one that just held steady was him with the 601 lawyers at that time.  And I remembered that.  And I said, “That’s the guy, because we’re going to win.”  But we have to keep them from being really bad, being naughty.  They tried.\nBut, you know, we had an expression: We got to make it too big to rig.  And that’s what we did.  Too big to rig.  (Applause.)  And it was a great night.\nAnd, Michael, thank you.  Great — just a fantastic job.  You’ll be working with these ladies and gentlemen on just keeping — keeping everything, including keeping governor’s seats, I assume.  You’re going to work with them on governor’s seats too, right?\nBut there’s no better man than Michael.  Thank you, Michael.  Great job.  Appreciate it.  (Applause.)\nAnd we’re gathered tonight at a really exciting time in our nation.  I think it’s going to be a very exciting time.  We have tremendous potential.  I have been called by every company — Brian just told me about a big one that’s going to be moving in in a very big way.  But I have been called by so many big companies that they want to beat the tariffs, and there’s only one way to beat the tariffs.\nTariffs, one of the most beautiful words I’ve ever heard.  In fact, I went around saying it’s my favorite word in the dictionary, and I got killed by the fake news media.  They said, “What about God?  What about religion?  What about love?”  I said, “All right.  I give up.  It’s my fourth favorite word.”  (Laughter.)  So, now I say God, religion, love, and then tariffs, number four.  (Laughter and applause.)  And now I’m okay.  I can get away with that.  I couldn’t get away with making it number one, but it’s close.  (Laughter.)\nThe American people gave Republicans a historic mandate in November — you remember that, November 5th — what a day that was, huh?  (Applause.)  No — there was no games.  November 5th, 2024, will go down as one of the most important days in the history of our country.  I believe that.\nWe won the House.  We won the Senate.  We won the White House.  And, in the presidential race, we won all seven swing states by a lot, and the popular vote by millions and millions of votes for the first time of any Republican in decades.  It’s hard for us to win the popular vote, but it’s not going to be anymore, because we’re a much different Republican Party right now.\nWe’re really — nobody can believe what’s happened to this party.  It’s become a big party, really big and powerful party.\nWe won 85 percent of all counties in America.  Think of that.  Eighty-five percent.  Have you seen the map?  It’s all red.  There’s a little blue on the outside here and — the outside.  The whole thing is, like, red.\nThey won 525 counties compared to us — 2,600 counties.  Think of that.  I don’t know why we only won by millions of votes.  We should have won by a lot more than that.  Maybe it’s because they cheated.  Who knows?\nAnd incredibly, all 50 states shifted toward the Republican Party.  That’s never happened before.  It’s the first time ever in history that that’s happened.  All 50 states shifted toward the Republicans — and significantly, in many cases.\nMost importantly for this room, we’re pleased to welcome eight new Republican governors.  Could you stand up please?  (Applause.)  Just stand up.  Look at these people.  Oh, I know them.  I know the men.  Good.  Great.  I know every one of them.  (Applause.)\nMike Braun of Indiana.  Mike Kehoe of Missouri.  Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire.  Larry Rhoden — that’s great — Larry Rhoden of South Dakota.  Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota.  Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia.  Jenniffer González-Colón of Puerto Rico.  Nikolao Pula of American Samoa.  (Applause.)\nAnd I want to congratulate you all.  You had great races.  You won, generally, pretty easily.  We’re going to win a lot of races.\nYou know, in presidential races, they say when you win the presidency, usually the midterms don’t go well.  I think we’re going to do great.  I think we’re going to really increase our margins by a lot.\nThat’s why I went to Michael.  I said, “You got to stay.  You can’t go anywhere, Michael.”\nBut I can tell you that I did something very different.  Our win was so big and so conclusive presidentially — and we had great help from donors.  We have a lot of great donors in the room tonight, but —\nThis is a nice room, by the way.  It’s a very nice place.\nBut we did something differently.  I said that — to my people that do the fundraising, I said, “Listen, everyone is so happy.”  Usually, you wait two or three years to go back to the donors.  You know, you let it rest.  You let their wallets cool off a little bit.  But I did it the next morning after we won. (laughter).\nI said to Meredith, who may or may not be here — I don’t think she is.  Maybe she is.  She’s great and — but I said to a whole staff of people — I said, “Call everybody and see if they’ll double up.”\nNow, we raised a billion six.  They raised $2.7 billion, and they’re running short.  They can’t raise the final 28.  You know, when you lose, it’s very hard to raise money.  But when you win, it’s not so hard.\nI said, “See what you can do.  Call everybody and say, ‘Thank you very much.  We appreciate it.  Would you like to make a contribution?’”  (Laughs.)\nSo, this was not a good situation, but they fully understood.  They were so happy, they didn’t care.\nAnd, Michael, we raised $608 million in three weeks.  Can you believe that?  Six — so we’ve got that money, and I got to spend it somewhere.  And they tell me I’m not allowed to run.  I’m not sure.  Is that true?  I’m not sure.  (Laughter.)\nSo, if I can’t spend it on me, I guess that means I’m going to be spending it on some of my friends, right?  A lot of my friends who are going to be running.  (Applause.)\nBut think of that.  We raised $608 million.  Isn’t that great?  And I think I’ll keep going.  I’ll just keep bugging them, bugging them, build it up.  But it’s going to be great.\nI think we’re going to do fantastically.  I think the midterms are going to be a big surprise.  And it just seems — I don’t know what it is.  You go back to the last, I think, eight elections in a row, the midterms haven’t been great for the person that wins the presidency.  And I think, so far, we’re very popular.\nI had an approval rating today of 71 and another one of 69.  (Applause.)  I have not heard of those numbers before.\nSo, we’re going to fight very hard, because the better I do, the better you do.  It makes your races a lot easier if we do well, and we’re going to keep doing well.\nWith the help of everyone here tonight, the golden age of America has officially begun and the golden age of — just this whole thing — the red states — it’s going to be leading the way to making our country richer and safer and stronger than ever before.\nThe red states are going to do good.  And the blue states — I don’t know — maybe they’ll totally disappear off that map.\nYou know, they don’t learn, because — you know, like men in women’s sports.  I say we’ve become the party of common sense.  Men in women’s sports is not a winner for them.  But I saw somebody fighting like hell for the fact that a man should partake in women’s sports — a Democrat, a radical left lunatic.  And they’re still going at it.\nAnd we shouldn’t really fight them too hard until just about a week or two before the election.  Just let them go.  Don’t convince them not to.\nYou know, I’m always saying, “They haven’t learned.”  I don’t want to say that.  Don’t say that.  Let them keep going.  And then about a week before the election, just blast the hell out of them.  (Laughter and applause.)\nIt’s like in a race.  You know, you hang in there, and then you just go.  Because there’s no way — open borders with prisoners coming in.  Jails.  Some of the worst murderers in the world.\nWe had — one guy killed five people — separately killed five different people.  This is not going to be a great person for our county.\nBut we had 11,088 murderers right now.  Some of them have been already brought back.  And you know, when you think about it, transgender everything.  Everybody should be transgender.  These are not things that play very well.  I would say they’re 7 percent issues for them, and they’re over 90 percent for us.  But they keep going.\nSo, don’t tell them they’re wrong.  It’s too long.  Two years or four years.  It’s too long.  Let them continue to go and say, “I think it’s a brilliant idea to have open borders, to allow prisons and mental institution people to pour in from all over the world.”  Everywhere.  They came from everywhere.\nBut about a week before that election, go crazy.  Just save up your money and explain we can’t live like this.  And they understand it.\nEvery day of my administration will be fighting to help your state succeed and prosper.  And together, we’re going to bring back the American dream — something nobody talks about anymore.\nIn our last four weeks, our new administration has accomplished more than most administrations do in four years, and the last administration was a negative.  I mean, it was accomplishment — I would say negative 50 percent.  There wasn’t any accomplishment.  There was de-accomplishment.\nOn day one, I declared a national emergency on our southern border.  I sent our military to the border to secure the sovereign territory of the United States of America.  We ended catch and release.  We began the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.  You know, he was sort of a moderate guy, but he was very strong on the fact he didn’t want people pouring into our country from all over the world.  He was very tough.  He had the record.\nWe now have the record.  It’s not a record I’m really proud of.  You don’t like to do that, but we have no choice.  We can’t let it — I mean, they let criminals — many, many criminals — hundreds of thousands, probably millions of criminals.  Twenty-one million people, I believe, is the number.  And of that, millions of people are hard, stone-cold criminals.\nIn the past four weeks, illegal border crossings have plummeted by nearly 100 percent, and the tiny number of illegals that do make it across are being apprehended and sent right back to their home, where they belong.  All countries are taking the illegal aliens back — every single one, even though they said, and strongly, “We’re never taking them back.  Don’t even try.”  They said that during the Biden administration.  It didn’t work.\nThey’re taking them back.  They have no choice.  They’re taking them back.  They know we’re not playing games.  (Applause.)\nYou remember Venezuela saying it: “We’re not taking them back.  Don’t even waste your time.”  They said that to Biden.  He said, “Well, they have us over a barrel.”  They don’t have us over a barrel.\nHow about BRICS?  You know, the BRICS states?  There are, like, six of them, and they were trying to destroy our dollar.  They were going to say — you know, they wanted to create a new currency.  They probably wanted to use the yuan, China.  They wanted to use the yuan.  And Biden said, “Well, this is a tough situation.  There’s not much we can do about that.  We can’t help that.”  I said, “Oh, we can help it.”\nSo, when I came in, the first thing I said is: Any BRICS state that even mentions the destruction of the dollar will be charged a 150 percent tariff.  And we don’t want your goods.  We don’t want to partake.  (Applause.)  And the BRICS states just broke up.  I don’t know what the hell happened to them.  We haven’t heard from the BRICS states lately.\nBut he said that wasn’t much we could do about it.  There was a lot.  It took once — literally.  They said, “Sir, what about the BRICS states?  They’re going to take over the dollar, the sanctity of the dollar.  They’re going to create a new currency to rule the world.”  I said, “No, they’re not.”  They said, “Yes, they are, sir.  They said it.”  I said, “No, they’re not.  Tell them 150 percent tariff, plus we’re not going to do business with them, and that includes China.”\nAnd all of a sudden, they went to the BRICS states, and they said, “Could I ask you, how do you feel about the” — “I have no comment on this.  I don’t know what you’re even talking about.”  It was an amazing turnaround.\nNo, we’re not playing games.\nJust this week, I officially designated the drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, including Tren de Aragua and MS-13, which gives us great power.  (Applause.)\nAnd to facilitate the rapid deportation of the worst criminals that we have anywhere in the world, we’ve also opened the full capacity of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  You know, people don’t realize that thing was built — you know, we hear about a few prisoners, and they do have maximum security, but it holds — actually, it was built for thousands and thousands of people, and we’re using that prior to bringing back to their country.\nWe use it for the bad ones, the really bad ones.  And in some cases, they’re so bad, we don’t want them to go back to the country.  We want to watch them, because they’ll be able — if they do sneak in, we don’t want that.  We don’t want them anywhere near our country.\nIn addition, we’re waging war on Joe Biden’s inflation disaster, the worst inflation probably in our history.  They say 48 years, which isn’t bad, but probably in our history.  And to bring down the price of energy, I declared a national energy emergency.  It’s going to be an emergency.  (Applause.)  And you know what our — what we say and what Doug is going to do — Doug, you are so important, you and Chris.\nYou know, Chris is known — and I got this from Doug — as the best energy guy in the entire country.  And people were shocked that he wanted to do this.  He gave up something tremendous.  He was the biggest guy.  There was nobody bigger, nobody better than Chris Wright.  (Applause.)\nIs Chris Wright here?  Is he here?  Where is he?  This guy is — and this is from Doug. I said, “Doug, I want to make you the Energy czar.”  And he said, “Sir, there’s one man that blows me away.”  Right, Doug?  He said, “His name is Chris Wright.  He’s much better.”  I said, “I want to see this man,” and I met him.  And I just agreed immediately that he was far superior to Doug.  I’m only kidding.  (Laughter.)\nSo, what I did — we have a weird deal.  You know, we have the Department of Energy and the Department of the Interior, and Interior has all of the energy.  And Doug has none of the energy, but he’s got — Chris has none of the energy, but he got a hell of a good title.  But we want the guy with the energy to be able to drill, so we sort of merged them.  And they’re friends and everything else, and they’ve got a thing going on.  I think it’s going to set records like nobody’s ever seen before.\nSo, we have the man that controls the energy, we have the man that drills the energy, and now we’ve put them together, and you’re going to see some action.  (Applause.)  You’re going to see something come way down.\nSo, thank you.  And thank you, Doug.  You were really a terrific — he was a great governor, by the way.  A couple of you may know him slightly.  But he was a great governor.  Did a fantastic job.\nYou know, he made a lot of money in the technology business.  Sold to Microsoft for a lot of money.  I won’t tell you how much.  I don’t want to embarrass him.  Some people would say it’s a lot.  Some people would say it wasn’t that much, right?  (Laughter.)  But, you know, when you get close to a billion dollars, that’s pretty good.\nAnd he didn’t know much about energy.  When he became governor, he became one of the great experts of energy anywhere.  We did unbelievable — really, an unbelievable job with the state.  He did like me: He did well in business, and then he said, “Let’s run for politics.”  And he did, and they love him in the state.  But he was term-limited, and I watched him running.  It was running against me, but I still liked him.  (Laughter.)  And I said, “That guy’s got real talent,” and he was one of the first people I called.\nSo, you’re doing a great job, and thank you for giving us — for leading us to Chris.  (Applause.)  I’ll give you a bigger thank you in two years if Chris is as good as you say.  Okay?  (Laughter.)  But I know he’s going to be.\nThanks a lot, Chris.  Good.  Go out there.\nIf we can bring energy down, everything’s coming down.  You know, the eggs are coming down, and the bacon is coming down.  Everything is coming down.  And that’s the biggest thing, the energy.  So, those two guys are very important.\nTo cut through the red tape, I’ve established a National Energy Dominance Council chaired by your former colleague, Secretary Burgum.  He’s going to do a fantastic job.  We’re putting incredible people on it.\nI withdrew from the one-sided and very expensive Paris Climate Accord.  It’s a one-way street.  (Applause.)  You know, under that accord, we pay $1 trillion.  Think of it.  We pay a trillion dollars.  They pay nothing.  China doesn’t pay anything.  India doesn’t pay anything.  Russia doesn’t pay.  We just pay everybody.\nIt’s like a health organization, and every one of the — every deal is no good, but we’re changing it.  We terminated health — you know, on the world health, we paid a hundred — we paid $500 million a year, and China paid $39 million a year.  I said, “That doesn’t sound good.”  They have 1.4 billion people, and we have — nobody knows what the hell our number is, because so many people pour into our country.  We used to say, like, 325.  I have no idea.  We’ll figure it out eventually.  But let’s put it this way: It should be substantially less than 1.4.\nBut we have — let’s say we have 325 million.  They have 1.4.  We’re paying $500 million.  And these aren’t — I mean, relative to government, these aren’t huge numbers, but this is an example of what happens when you have bad government, when you have incompetent people.\nSo, I would explain this, and they called me, and they said, “We’ll let you in for the same $39 million.”  I said, “Well, we should be much less than 39.  We should be” — but I didn’t even want to do that, because I’m not going to talk — I said, “I’ll think about it.”  And it was very public.  And when Biden came in, he agreed to go back in to the World Health for $500 million.  He could have gotten — I mean, it’s a lot of money.  You could have gotten it for $39 million, Joe.  That’s why you’re not president any longer, I guess.  (Laughter and applause.)\nNo, he could have had it for 39.  They were standing there, “We’re going to” — it was very public.  But he went in — he took the $500 million instead, because he never laid in bed at night, sweating, tossing and turning, like half of these governors — not all of them, probably, but half of them.  They’re sweating, “How are we going to do a great job?”  He never did that.\nBut that’s just a case study in, you know, how not to run.  Because, you know, if we — if we had people at that level that would have negotiated — I bought a plane.  It’s really two planes.  Air Force One.  Now, if Boeing would build a damn thing, it would be nice too.  We don’t build like we used to.  We don’t build too fast.  I gave the order out about six years ago.  They’re still waiting.  Getting a little tired of it.\nI gave a fixed-price deal, but it was $5.7 billion.  I negotiated with Boeing.  It took about two months, and I got the 5.7 down to $4 billion.  Actually, one penny less than 4.  I said, “It has to have a three on it.”  And he said, “You want from 5.7 to 3?”  And I said, “Yeah, three on it, meaning it has to start with a three.”  And after about two months of saying, “No, no, no, no, it has to have a three.  It has to have a three,” he called up.  He said, “Sir, 3 bil-“ — what I want, and this is what happened: $3,999,999,999.99.  One penny less.  (Laughter.)  I said, “You have a deal.”  But we saved $1.7 billion just by negotiating.\nAnd in all fairness, mostly, you can do that.  And some of you do do it.  Some of you do.  You know, you have surplus states.  You have incredible states, and you have to do that, because every time somebody sends you a bill, they expect to be negotiated.  And in the past administration — and sometimes, I guess, in this, it happens, because people don’t care.\nYou know, Elon talks about caring.  Caring is very important.  And they have to care.  If they care, they say, “No, no, I’ll pay you” — they’ll send you a bill for $10,000, and you say, “Nope, I’ll give you five.”  And they’ll say, “No way, no way, no way,” and you’ll end up paying six or seven or something.  But all you have to do is care a little bit and try and get it down.\nAnd literally, every contract.  I think, there’s not a contract that’s sent in government that I couldn’t — and that many of you couldn’t cut and cut very substantially.  And boy, what a difference it would make for the government.\nI terminated the Green New Scam, one of the great scams in the history of our country.  I canceled Joe Biden’s insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry from destruction.  (Applause.)  That was an easy one.  And all of this helps to combat inflation and bring down costs.\nWe’re bringing down costs way down.  We’re going to bring up jobs like you haven’t seen because the companies pouring in.  And we’re going to have announcements over the next three, four weeks that you’re not going to believe from some of the biggest companies in the world.  And the numbers are staggering: hundreds of billions of dollars of investment, hundreds and hundreds — trillions of dollars, when you add it up.\nTo slash hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and fraud, we’re talking about also — and abuse — I’ve created, as you possibly have read just a little bit, the Department of Government Efficiency.  (Applause.) And here are just some of the things that we’ve paid, and we’ve stopped, and we’ve gotten the money back.      $520 million for a consultant to do ESG — that’s environmental, social, and governance investments — in Africa — $525 million.\n$25 million to promote biodiversity, conservation, and social responsibility behavior in Colombia.\n$40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants.  Nobody even knows what the hell it means.  (Laughter.)\n$42 million for social and behavioral change in Uganda.\n$10 million for Mozambique medical male circumcision.  We’re doing circumcisions in Mozambique to the tune of approximately $12 million.\n$14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia.\n$486 million to the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening, including $22 million for inclusive and participatory political process in Moldova and $21 million for voter turnout in India.  Why are we caring about India turnout?  We got enough problems.  We want our own turnout, don’t we?  Can you imagine, all that money going to India?  I wonder what they think when they get it.\nNow, it’s a kickback scheme.  You know, it’s not like they get it and they spend — they kick it back to the people that send it, I would say, in many cases — many of these cases.  Anytime you have no idea what we’re talking about, that means there’s a kickback, because nobody has any idea what’s going on here.\n$29 million to strengthen the political landscape in Bangladesh.  Nobody knows what they mean by “political landscape.”  What does that mean?\n$20 million for fiscal federalism and $19 million for biodiversity in Nepal.\n$47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia.  What the hell do I care about?  We got a lot.  We got enough problems.\nAnd all of this is terminated.  We terminated this stuff, and we’re on the track.  And, by the way, so many others I could have — I could — I could read all night long.  But so many were so terrible, and some — some were actually disgusting.  And I know you’re eating your dinner, so I didn’t want to do that.  (Laughter.)\nBut we’re draining the swamp.  And, you know, one of them was $100 million for condoms for Hamas.  You heard about that.  Fifty and fifty.  It’s $50 million, and then they decided they needed more condoms, so they sent another $50 million.  So, it’s $100 million — condoms for Hamas.\nBut now that’s the good stuff.  Here’s even worse: Social Security.  As you know, generally speaking, people don’t live to be over 100 years old.  We all will, I think — 120, 130, hopefully.  But, you know, you hate — when you get near that number, it’s like, “Let’s hope we can live to length like this.”   But here’s what we’re finding and what we found, and these were all found by these computer geniuses.\nI asked Elon, “What trait do these have?”  You know, they started off with 12 guys, then they had 30 guys, then they had 57 guys.  Now they have over 100 guys.  And he attracts very young people with high IQs.  You know?  Some people attract very beautiful people.  I think I like them better, actually.  (Laughter.)  But he attracts young people that are brilliant, and they love the country too.\nBut I said, “What trait do they really have?”  And the trait that they really have was that they’re extraordinary with computers.  They can take them — he said, “They make love to their computer.”  I said, “I don’t want to hear about that.  Doesn’t sound too” — (laughter).  He said, “They can take apart the most complex computer instruments and — and literally put them back blindfolded.”\nSo, when they go into some guy that’s ripping off the country by doing some of the things you’ve just heard or what you’re going to hear, they can’t be bullshitted.  You know?  They can’t say, “Oh, gee, there was a mistake.  There was a big mistake.”\nAnd we’re finding hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of fraud, waste, and abuse.  But I think fraud will be the number one as we see.\nBut listen to this.  On the program, there are 4.7 million Social Security members who go and live from 100 to 109.  Well, I’ll tell you, I know some people that are close to 100.  I know one or two that got over that mark.  But you get — you don’t have millions.\n3.6 million people from age 110 to age 119.  3.47 million people from age 120 to 129.  In other words, 120 to 129 years old, millions of people — millions.  3.9 million people from age 130 to 139, which is pretty amazing, because the longest-living person ever on record — and they’re not sure it was correct — was a woman from a very faraway place lived to 127 years old.  She was a healthy specimen.  (Laughter.)  But she lived to 127.\n3.5 million people from age 140 to 149.  So, we have 140-year-old people, plus.  Millions of them.  1.3 million people live to over 150 years of age — 150 to 159, to be exact.  Over 130,000 people over the age of 160 years old, including 1,039 people between the ages of 220 to 229.  (Laughter.)      And we’re going to be investigating this fraud.  The — actually, we had one person at — who was 361 years old.  (Laughter.)  And what we’re doing now is we’re finding how many of these people were paid.  So, we have millions of people — could be well over 100 million people on our Social Security rolls.\nSo, the good news is, when we take them off, whether they were paid or not, it looks like our Social Security could be really solid.  It could be a lot better than we thought, if you think about it.  (Applause.)\nAnd I’m going to do something — I’m actually going on this one.  You know, all my life I’ve heard about Fort Knox.  That’s where the gold is kept, right?  I heard, “Fort Knox.  Oh, ho, ho.”  But, you know, we’re getting a little bit shaky.  We’re getting the yips on this stuff.  Like, I want to find out.\nSo, we’re going to open up the doors.  I’m going to see if we have gold there.  We want to find out: Did anybody steal the gold in Fort Knox?  It’s a pretty amazing place.\nBut I’m going to actually go.  We’re going to open the doors.  We’re going to inspect Fort Knox.  We want to make sure that we actually have, you know, 400 tons of gold or whatever the hell it is.  (Applause.)  It’s a lot of gold.  I don’t want to open it and the cupboards are bare.  Could happen.\nIf you look at some of the things — oh, by the way, wait until we go into the Education Department.  We haven’t even done that.  So, we — we could find as much as $1.5 trillion worth of waste, fraud, and abuse.  If we do that, we can balance budgets.  We can do a lot of other things, especially when you couple it with the massive amounts of tariffs that are coming in.     Already, you know, just with what we are charging — I won’t mention the country because I don’t want to anger people that like me, and I like them very much.  But we’re finding at least $60 billion a year in one country alone.  And I haven’t even started, it’s just a very small portion that I’ve, you know, attached to them.\nSo, I got a call from Congress.  They said, “You know, a lot of money is coming in from these tariffs,” and they’re starting to change their whole thing.\nSo, if you can add the tariffs — and this is numbers that — I don’t want to say it, because then they’ll say, “He didn’t produce.”  But you could wipe out your income tax.  You could maybe not even have an income tax system when this thing works out.  (Applause.)  Because in the old days, that’s what happened.\nYou know, our country was the richest ever from 1870 to 1913.  That’s when we were actually the richest, and we were a full tariff country.\nMcKinley — and I just — by the way, I just renamed Mount McKinley “Mount McKinley.”  I hope you’re happy about that.  (Applause.)  But McKinley was a president.  He was a tariff guy, and he believed that countries should not be allowed to come in and plunder.  He would see — he had beautiful language on tariffs.  Plunder our wealth, plunder our jobs, steal our companies, and take without paying a very fair price.\nAnd he said — and that price should be more than fair.  It should be high, because what they do is they hurt our country.  And we became very rich.  He was assassinated.  And, as you know, Roosevelt took over — Teddy.  And he spent money on parks and on dams and on everything.  I mean, you know — but he really spent a lot of the money — McKinley never got the credit — but he spent a lot of the money that McKinley made.\nBut it was the richest we ever were in the 1800s, early 1900s.  And then, in 1913, we went to the income tax system.  And to be honest, we did fine, but we were never like we were.  They formed the tariff commission of 1887, and it was a commission of people like you.  Blue bloods.  Are you blue bloods?  There are a couple in — about three of them over here.  But blue bloods.\nBut it was a commission, and it was set up for the sole purpose of — we have so much money.  This is in the United States.  We don’t know — we had no debt.  We had no nothing.  We had massive amounts of money.  The commission was set up to determine where we should spend our money.  Where do we spend it?  Got so much.\nCan you imagine?  Wouldn’t that be nice?  Now look at what they’re doing.  But this is money we have to borrow where they’re doing it.  But we’re going to find out that this money went to people and it got kicked back.  You’re going to find out a lot of that.  But we’ll catch it all.\nWe’ve launched the largest deregulation campaign in our country’s history.  (Applause.)   For every 1 new regulation, I’ve directed that 10 old regulations must be eliminated.\nAnd I will say, in my first term, we did more deregulation than any president in history, by far.  Not even close.\nWith Republicans in Congress, we’re also racing to pass the largest tax cuts in American history.  We’re looking to — we brought it down from 41 percent — much higher, if you add the state things — but 41 percent to 21 percent, which people said was impossible.  And now I’m trying to bring it down to 15 percent.\nSo, it’ll go from 21 to 15, but only if you make your product in the United States of America.  Otherwise, you pay 21 percent.  (Applause.)  That would be great.\nTo protect American auto workers, which — who, by the way, they’re going to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what we’re doing with tariffs — because they just stopped two big auto plants in the middle of construction from being built in Mexico because they see — when I got elected, they saw, “Oh, this is going to be a problem for us.”  Because we have big tariffs going on, and we have tariffs going on autos.\nAnd they don’t have to pay any tariffs.  There is no tariff.  All you have to do is build your plant in the United States.  They were building plants in Mexico, right opposite the border.  They’re making them in Mexico.  They’re selling them into the United States with virtually no tax.  And they’re killing all our — Detroit — all these places are being killed.  Now it’s the exact opposite.\nAnd by the way, Canada was a big participant in that too.  And I think Canada — you know, they’re going to have to pay tariffs on automobiles, lumber, and oil and gas, et cetera, et cetera.  And they get 95 percent of their product from the United States.  I think they have to become the 51st state.\nAnd you heard the people booing the national anthem, but I think, ultimately, they’ll be praising the national anthem.  We’ll have to work out some deal — because I do like the “O Canada.”  Right?  It’s a beautiful thing.  I think we’re going to have to keep it for the 51st state.\nI call him Governor Trudeau.  I said, “Governor Trudeau is doing a wonderful job.”  I think it’s actually cost him his election, if you want to know the truth.\nBut we’re going to — we’re going to see about that.  We’re looking at Greenland, and we have to take back the Panama Canal, because that wasn’t the deal.  (Applause.)\nWe gave the Panama Canal to Panama.  It was the most expensive thing ever built in our country.  It would be the equivalent of $2 trillion today.  We spent massive amounts.  We lost 38,000 lives from the mosquito and snakes.  A lot of bad snake bites, but mostly the mosquitoes.  They — malaria — they killed 38,000 of our people.\nThey paid laborers five times what they were getting in the United States to go, knowing that there was a good chance they were going to die.  Twenty percent of them died.\nAnd Jimmy Carter, may he rest in peace — the late, great Jimmy Carter — gave it away for $1.\nIt’s also the most profitable thing ever built.  You know, it’s — what you hear about casinos and you hear about all this stuff — they’re peanuts compared to this.  It’s very — it’s the most profitable thing ever built.\nThere’s never been anything — I mean, you have ships lined up.  And by the way, when they gave it away — they gave it away like a bunch of dummies for $1.  The day after they took over, they raised the price per ship by four times.  That wasn’t high enough.  There was no — no problem.  They raised it again twice.  And they’re getting almost a million dollars a ship.\nAnd their product is water.  It’s Pacific and Atlantic, where they meet.  And one is about 18 feet higher than the other, which a lot of people don’t know.  Actually, it’s one of the great marvels of the world.\nWell, we built it.  And we’re not going to let — because China has essentially taken it over.  We’re not going to let that happen.  China knows it, and so does Panama.\nTo protect American workers and bring billions of dollars into our treasury, we’re in the process of imposing reciprocal tariffs on any nation that tries to cheat us or steal our jobs.\nSo, India, as an example, has very, very high tariffs, and I was going to impose a flat tariff, but that wouldn’t really do the trick, because some of the countries have really high tariffs.\nSo, it really works out much better.  Nobody can even fight it.  Whatever they charge us, we charge them.  So, if they’re at 25 percent, we are 25.  If they’re at 75, we’re at —\nWhatever they charge us — and it was very interesting.  The European Union — you know, we were at 2.5 percent for cars.  European Union was much higher.  They just reduced their tariffs on cars to 2.5 to be reciprocal with ours.  So, that’s just an early sign.  But I think that’s going to happen.\nAnd then some will — some will want to fight us a little bit, but it doesn’t matter.  They’re reciprocal.  And even the press says, “Oh, I see.”  Well, they don’t fight us.\nYou know, if I put a flat tariff on, like, 25, 30 percent, even if it was lower than we would have gotten, if we put a flat tariff on, the press would have gone crazy.  “We — that’s terrible.”  Even if somebody was paying, like, five times more, charging us five times more.\nWhen you say reciprocal — I said it the other day to the failing New York Times.  I said, “Listen, whatever they charge us, we charge them.”  They go, “Well, that sounds fair.”  It truly does, doesn’t it?  (Laughter.)\nSo, it’s a reciprocal tariff.  Whatever they charge us.\nI’ve ended Joe Biden’s weaponization of our government and removed his handpicked radical-left, Marxist prosecutors from the Department of Justice.  (Applause.)  We have a great attorney general: Pam.\nI immediately halted all government censorship and brought back free speech in America.  I signed an executive order to end all of the lawless diversity, equity, and inclusion policies across the entire federal government and private sector.  (Applause.)\nDo you see how much it costs?  One company said they’re going out of that business and they’re going to write off $229 million.  The — how do you spend that much money to convince people that they should have transgender operations and various and sundry other things that we don’t like to talk about?\nIt’s crazy the amount of money that was — it was almost like a — just a mind-blower what they were doing.  It was terrible and all over.\nAnd by the way, our military is now free of that.  Anybody that even tries it, they’re gone.  I signed really historic orders to get critical race theory and transgender ideology out of the schools and out of our military.  It’s all going out.  It’s no longer.  (Applause.)\nAnd I heard men are still playing in Maine.  Is anybody here from Maine?  Ah.  Who is that?  Is that the governor?  (Laughs.)  That’s — well, I hate to tell you this, but we’re not going to give them any federal money.  They are still saying we want men to play in women’s sports, and I cannot believe that they’re doing that.  They are — (inaudible) find out who that guy is that raised his hand.  Maybe he’s just kidding.  (Laughter.)\nBut — so, we’re not going to give them any federal funding — none whatsoever — until they clean that up.      And the other one, we has — have a fight with one news organization: AP, a radical-left organization.  Treats us all very badly.  And they refuse to acknowledge that the Gulf — former — of Mexico is now called the Gulf of America.  (Applause.)\nSo, we just hold them — we’re holding them — we’re holding them out of our — any news conferences.  Now, I’m sure they’ll get sued, and maybe they’ll win.  It doesn’t matter.  It’s just something that we feel strongly about.\nNo, and I said we changed Mount McKinley.  Nobody is fighting that.  You’re allowed to do it — what we’re allowed to do.  And most of the shoreline is — you know, 85 percent of it is on our soil, but I thought it would be appropriate.\nI never understood, quite, the Gulf of Mexico when it really covers us far more.  And I think Doug is a big believer in what we did — the Gulf of America.\nSo, we’re having a little dispute, but only one.  But Google Maps has already changed.  Almost everybody has already changed.  It’s called the Gulf of America.  (Applause.)\nAnd earlier this month, I signed an order banning men from women’s sports.  (Applause.)  And that’s why, when somebody wants to do that — when somebody wants to do that — and even the NCAA has already complied.  And they have sent us a letter.  They have fully complied with that.\nI also proudly banned the use of puberty blockers, hormone injections — you believe this? — and other chemical and surgical mutilations of all minor youth.  Do you believe you have to say that?  I mean, it’s terrible.\nWho would believe that we were talking about even these things.  Men playing in — 10 years ago, 15 years ago, can you imagine?  People would say, “Is he crazy, talking about this?”\nAnd they’re still fighting us, but let them fight.  As I said, we’re going to make universal school choice a very big, strong thing.  School choice.  (Applause.)  And we’re working very, very hard to send these schools and education back to the states where they can be properly run.  (Applause.)  In other words, this really affects the people in this room.\nBut you’re going to be running your schools, and who can do worse?  Look, they rate them in the top 40.  So, we just came out with one that we were number 40, but we were number 1 in cost per pupil.\nAnd, I mean, I know a lot of the governors in this room.  You run a great state, and you’ll do great with education at a much lower price — we’re going to give you whatever you need — but at a much lower price.\nWe have people in Washington, D.C., that, in all fairness, in many cases, don’t give a damn about your pupils or your students or your states.  And they’re running everything, and they’re running it into the ground.\nSo, it came out we’re last in education but first in cost per pupil.  Norway; Denmark; Sweden; I have to tell you, China; and a few others are always in the top five.  And I really believe that 35 or 36 states and all of you are here — almost all of you here representing those states, I think you’re going to have education that’s every bit as good as Norway and Denmark and Sweden and all of them.\nAnd then we’ll have some laggards.  And you know who the laggards are going to be.  You just have to look at everything else.\nBut in everything we do, we’re putting America first, because the Republican Party is now known as the party of common sense.  It’s the party of common sense.  Very important.  I think it’s a very important phrase for you to use.  It’s all about common sense.  We’re conservative, and, you know, we’re a lot of things, but most important thing is we have to use common sense.\nThanks in part to the hard work of the people in this room, we’re forging a new political majority that is shattering and replacing Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal coalition, which dominated American politics for nearly 100 years.\nUnder our leadership, the Republican Party has become the proud voice of hardworking citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.  We are a much bigger, much more powerful party.  Now is the time for us all to press forward, think big, be bold, and deliver the once-in-a-lifetime reforms our citizens need and really deserve.\nThey’ve gone through hell for four years.  Some of them don’t even know it.  They’ve just been led down a path.  They don’t even know what they’ve gone through.\nAs one team, we can make our borders stronger, our communities safer, our schools better, our families happier, our citizens wealthier, and our country freer, freer, freer and more exceptional than ever before.\nWe will work together, and we will absolutely, without question, make America great again.\nGod bless you all.  And do a great job.  And go home and watch the hockey game.  It should be interesting.  (Applause.)\nThank you all very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nThank you.  Thank you, Brian.  Thank you.  Thank you. (Applause.)     Thanks.\nEND                    8:25 P.M. EST"

    "content": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nOn the morning of February 19, 1945, the first wave of United States Marines landed on the island of Iwo Jima — commencing 36 long, perilous days of gruesome warfare, and one of the most consequential campaigns of the Second World War.  With ruthless fervor, the Japanese struck our forces with mortars, heavy artillery, and a steady barrage of small arms fire, but they could not shake the spirit of the Marines, and American forces did not retreat.\nFive days into the conflict, six Marines ascended the island’s highest peak and hoisted Old Glory into the summit of Mount Suribachi — a triumphant moment that has stood the test of time as a lasting symbol of the grit, resolve, and unflinching courage of Marines and all of those who serve our Nation in uniform.\nAfter five weeks of unrelenting warfare, the island was declared secure, and our victory advanced America’s cause in the Pacific Theater — but at a staggering cost.  Of the 70,000 men assembled for the campaign, nearly 7,000 Marines and Sailors died, and 20,000 more were wounded.\nThe battle was defined by massive casualties, but also acts of gallantry — 27 Marines and Sailors received the Medal of Honor for their valor during Iwo Jima.  No other single battle in our Nation’s history bears this distinction.  Eighty years later, we proudly continue to honor their heroism.\nAmerican liberty was secured, in part, by young men who stormed the black sand shores of Iwo Jima and defeated the Japanese Imperial Army eight decades ago.  In spite of a brutal war, the United States–Japan Alliance represents the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.\nNonetheless, our victory at Iwo Jima stands as a legendary display of American might and an eternal testament to the unending love, nobility, and fortitude of America’s Greatest Generation.  To every Patriot who selflessly rose to the occasion, left behind his family and his home, and gallantly shed his blood for freedom on the battlefields at Iwo Jima, we vow to never forget your intrepid devotion — and we pledge to build a country, a culture, and a future worthy of your sacrifice.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 19, 2025, as the 80th Anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima.  I encourage all Americans to remember the selfless patriots of the Greatest Generation.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth."

    "content": "PRESERVING FEDERAL BENEFITS FOR AMERICAN CITIZENS: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to ensure taxpayer resources are not used to incentivize or support illegal immigration.\n- The Order directs Federal departments and agencies to identify all federally funded programs currently providing financial benefits to illegal aliens and take corrective action.\n- It ensures that Federal funds to states and localities will not be used to support “sanctuary” policies or assist illegal immigration.\n- It mandates improvements in eligibility verification to prevent benefits from going to individuals unlawfully present in the United States.\n- President Trump is committed to safeguarding Federal public benefits for American citizens who are truly in need, including individuals with disabilities and veterans.\nTAXPAYERS ARE FOOTING THE BILL FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION: With this Executive Order, President Trump is ensuring taxpayer resources are used to protect the interests of American citizens, not illegal aliens.\n- The surge in illegal immigration, enabled by the previous Administration, is siphoning dollars and essential services from American citizens while state and local budgets grow increasingly strained.\n- Under current welfare laws, specifically the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), illegal aliens are generally barred from welfare programs. But if they’re granted parole, they are classified as “qualified aliens” and become eligible for various welfare programs on a sliding scale, with full eligibility granted within five years.\n- According to the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), providing welfare to one million illegal aliens could cost American taxpayers an additional $3 billion annually.\n- The U.S. House Homeland Security Committee estimated that taxpayers could pay as much as $451 billion to care for illegal aliens and gotaways that have entered the United States unlawfully since January 2021.\n- The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) calculated that American taxpayers spend at least $182 billion annually to cover the costs incurred by the presence of 20 million illegal aliens and their children, which includes $66.5 billion in Federal expenses plus an additional $115.6 billion in state and local expenses.\n- The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the Biden Administration’s open borders agenda, which sought to provide Medicaid-funded emergency services to illegal aliens, has cost Federal and state taxpayers more than $16.2 billion.\n- The Biden Administration gave billions in taxpayer dollars to left-wing groups that facilitated mass illegal migration and provided legal services to challenge deportation orders.\n- In addition, since 2021, more than $1 billion has been allocated through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to illegal aliens.\nSECURING THE BORDER AND PUTTING AMERICANS FIRST: President Trump has delivered on his promise to secure the border and prioritize the needs of American citizens, taking immediate action to put an end to the previous Administration’s border crisis. Since taking office, President Trump has:\n- Declared a national emergency at the southern border.\n- Deployed additional personnel to the border, including members of the Armed Forces and the National Guard.\n- Restarted border wall construction.\n- Designated international cartels and other criminal organizations – such as MS-13 and Tren de Aragua – as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists.\n- Suspended the entry of aliens into the U.S.\n- Called for enhanced vetting and screening of aliens.\n- Required the identification of countries that warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals.\n- Restarted the detention and removal of aliens who are in violation of Federal law.\n- Directed the Administration to resume the Migrant Protection Protocols – also known as “Remain in Mexico” – as soon as practicable.\n- Ended the use of the CBP One app.\n- Terminated all categorical parole programs, such as the “Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans,” that are contrary to President Trump’s immigration agenda.\n- Ended automatic citizenship for children of illegal aliens.\n- Paused the operation of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).\n- Ended catch-and-release policies.\n- Revoked Biden’s disastrous executive actions that essentially opened our southern border.\n- Detained the most dangerous illegal criminal aliens in Guantanamo Bay."

    "content": "Last week, President Donald J. Trump established the National Energy Dominance Council — a cornerstone in the Trump Administration’s pursuit of unleashing American energy. Led by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, the Council will play a key role in the Trump Administration’s work to lower energy prices, meet the rising demand for affordable energy, strengthen economic security, and ensure the American energy industry is best positioned as a global leader over the next century.\nThe move was hailed by lawmakers, workers, and industry:\nHouse Committee on Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie (R-KY): “Energy security is national security. By utilizing our domestic energy resources to create baseload power, we can lower prices, secure our grid, and provide the energy needed to grow manufacturing, heat our homes, and fill our gas tanks. The creation of this council under the leadership of Secretary Wright and Secretary Burgum is a strong step toward securing our energy future, and ensuring we have the resources necessary to meet the demands that AI will place on our grid. President Trump is continuing to fulfill his promise to the American people to return our nation to energy dominance, and I look forward to working together to achieve that goal.”\nAmerican Exploration and Production Council: “Our nation is stronger, more secure, and more prosperous when America is the world leader in energy production, and AXPC applauds the Trump administration’s recognition that a whole of government approach is necessary to address the challenges related to American energy dominance. Sound energy policy across agencies will support our ability to meet rising national and global demand for affordable, reliable energy. We will continue to work with Congress and the Trump administration and the new National Energy Dominance Council on sensible, durable policies that allow American energy companies to continue to innovate and produce the energy America needs.”\nNorth America’s Building Trades Unions: “North America’s Building Trades Unions look forward to engaging with the National Energy Dominance Council recently established by the White House. This effort, chaired by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and vice-chaired by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, comes at a critical moment for our nation. As our country’s energy demands continue to rise and we work to meet the needs of artificial intelligence, confront rising adversarial powers, and provide our citizenry with stable and affordable energy, we at NABTU are ready to meet the moment. The men and women of the Building Trades have built the existing energy infrastructure of this nation and are eager to partner with this Council to provide the highly skilled workforce necessary to advance America’s all-of-the-above energy strategy and bring about the next generation of expanded, domestic and affordable power supply.”\nNational Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson: “We are thrilled that President Trump has established the National Energy Dominance Council to tackle some of the biggest energy policy challenges facing our nation. Electricity demand is skyrocketing, yet due to bad policy decisions, always-available baseload power is being forced to retire before it can be reliably replaced. As a result, much of the country faces an increased risk of energy shortfalls over the next decade. Under the leadership of Chairman Doug Burgum and Vice Chairman Chris Wright, the Council is perfectly positioned to address the growing threats to reliable and affordable power. We believe the Executive Order’s focus on improving key processes, including those for permitting, producing and distributing American energy, is exactly the right place to start.”\nUnited Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters General President Mark McManus: “The men and women of the United Association are the best trained and most highly skilled craftspeople in the energy industry, and for generations we have built the critical infrastructure that delivers affordable domestic energy to our homes and businesses across the nation. We are now poised to deliver the next generation of energy production at this critical point in our nation’s history, but all too often government red tape and environmental activist groups stand in the way of these good paying and family-sustaining jobs. We look forward to working with President Trump and the new National Energy Dominance Council to cut government red tape and modernize our permitting processes to boost domestic production of critical energy like oil, gas, hydrogen, carbon capture, and nuclear, and to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy.”\nPower The Future Executive Director Daniel Turner: “The National Energy Dominance Council is a long-overdue course correction that prioritizes American energy workers, revitalizes domestic production, and ensures affordability for families. The NEDC has the opportunity to right the many wrongs of the Biden administration’s failures by working alongside the private sector to create policies that increase production, drive down costs, and protect the environment. By cutting through burdensome regulations and anti-energy mandates, the NEDC will unleash America’s full energy potential and pave the way for an era of prosperity, affordability, and innovation.”\nNational Association of Manufacturers President Jay Timmons: “President Trump is moving quickly to unleash America’s full energy potential by establishing the National Energy Dominance Council, setting America up to lead on energy and secure our energy independence. This action demonstrates President Trump and his administration’s commitment to ensuring manufacturers have the energy they need to drive economic growth. […] The National Energy Dominance Council, under the leadership of Interior Secretary Burgum and Energy Secretary Wright, will help power the future of manufacturing in America because when manufacturing wins, America wins.”\nCompetitive Enterprise Institute Senior Fellow Marlo Lewis: “This is welcome news. Unlike the previous administration, which increased US reliance on oil imports from OPEC and critical minerals from China by rigging domestic markets against reliable energy from fossil fuels, President Trump seeks to emancipate all sources of reliable American energy to compete in domestic and overseas markets. The president also seeks to accelerate the permitting of new energy infrastructure, including the power plants needed to support hundreds of new data centers and US leadership in artificial intelligence. President Trump is correct that clearing away impediments to America’s global leadership in energy production and exports will lower energy prices, enhance US economic security, create millions of new well-paying jobs, and strengthen US competitiveness in advanced technologies such as AI.”\nGrowth Energy: “#ICYMI last week @POTUS established the National Energy Dominance Council, noting that #biofuels ‘reduce our dependency on foreign imports, and grow our economy’ – #ethanol producers are ready to deliver for American consumers and the president’s priorities!”\nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship Council: “The National Energy Dominance Council is greatly needed to promptly reduce onerous barriers and rules that work against an abundant energy supply. Rather than federal government agencies finding ways to expand their regulatory turf and stymie the energy sector, the Council is tasked with reducing outdated red tape and moving with speed on recommendations and action, which will facilitate the significant investment needed for big projects. A modern regulatory system and commitment to U.S. energy supremacy will generate quality jobs, economic vibrancy and growth, and innovations that will yield efficiencies and cleaner energy. As both energy consumers and as significant players in the U.S. energy sector, small businesses will greatly benefit. SBE Council thanks President Trump for prioritizing this critical sector and for his commitment to more affordable, reliable and abundant energy for America.”\nAmericans for Prosperity: “Coupled with earlier Executive Orders signed by President Trump, with this Order, the current administration is well on its way in laying the groundwork for a future where energy abundance can become a reality.  Americans for Prosperity applauds President Trump’s actions in this Executive Order and anticipates a bright future for energy production in this country.”"

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  What a great group this is.  You have to see outside.  It’s going wild outside with a lot of love for all of us, I guess.  (Laughter.)\nBut thank you, Richard, for the introduction.  And thank you to all for such a warm welcome.\nIt’s great to be back in beautiful Miami, where I’ve actually built a lot of great buildings with the Dezer family and some others.  We’ve had tremendous success in Miami.  We have Trump Towers in Sunny Isles Beach.  It’s four beautiful buildings right on the ocean.\nThe Trump Grande — put the little E on the end for a little — class it up a little bit.  (Laughter.)  Trump Grande.\nAnd the 700-acre Doral.  That’s a tremendous country club in the — it’s actually the most successful country club in the U.S., where I was just given approval to build 1,500 units.\nAnd I couldn’t care less about building units.  When you’re president, who the hell wants to build units?  (Laughter.)  I’ve been building units all my life.  I don’t want to build units, but they gave us permission to do it.\nBut today is a tremendous honor to become the first American president to address the Future Investment Initiative Institute.  That’s the first one.  That’s very — it’s always nice.  (Applause.)\nAnd I want to thank Mayor of Miami Francis Suarez for being here.  Thank you very much, Francis, wherever you may be.  (Applause.)  Hi, Francis.  And thank you for the endorsement when I ran.  I was very appreciative.\nAlong with the mayor of Miami Beach, Steven Meiner.  Steven, thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you, Steven.  Thank you very much.\nAnd numerous American business leaders, some of the bi- — biggest business leaders, actually, anywhere in the world, and many distinguished guests from the Middle East, and, in particular, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia — a special place with special leaders.  (Applause.)\nAnd including FII Institute chairman and governor of the Public Investment Fund, which is a seriously big fund, Yasir.  I see you there.  Stand up, Yasir.  (Applause.)  Everyone knows Yasir.  Thank you.  Great guy.  Great, great person.\nAnd Finance Minister Mohammed, thank you very much.  Thank you right — thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Good to see you again.  That’s pretty good: finance minister of that part of the world.  That’s not bad.  (Laughter.)  Other parts of the world, not so good, but that one is good.  (Laughter.)\nAnd many other senior government leaders.  I also want to recognize the Kingdom’s ambassador to the United States, Her Royal Highness Princess Reema.  (Applause.)  Ooh, very popular.  Very popular.  Wow.  That’s very nice.  Sitting next to Elon.  Wow, that’s — you couldn’t do better than that, huh?  (Applause.)\nAs well as my own special envoy to the Middle East, who has really done a fantastic job, Steve Witkoff.  Thank you, Steve.  (Applause.)  He’s been busy.  And Michael Waltz is here.  Where is Michael?  Michael has been so busy.  They’ve been going back and forth and back.\nAnd a woman who was just voted the most powerful woman an- — anywhere in the world — (applause) — no, I’ll go with — I’m going to go with Princess Reema — but she was voted the most powerful woman anywhere in the world: Susie Wiles.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Most powerful woman, that’s pretty good.  We have to talk to you about that, Susie.  That’s pretty good.  (Laughter.)\nAnd also, we all know Jared Kushner, a very special guy.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Jared.  Thank you, Jared.\nAnd Elon Musk.  He’s been making a little news lately, hasn’t he, though?  (Applause.)  Very positive news.  Stand up, Elon.  (Applause.)  He’s a great guy.\nWe did a little show last night.  I heard that it got very good ratings, too, by the way.  We did “Hannity.”  Sean Hannity was fantastic — a fantastic man, a fantastic guy, and he did a show.  And it was great being on the show with you last night.\nI come today with a simple message for business leaders from all across the nation and all around the world: If you want to build the future, push boundaries, unleash breakthroughs, transform industries, and make a fortune — because you want to make fortune; most of you have already made a fortune, I don’t want to say — (laughter) — there is no better place on Earth than the current and future United States of America under a certain president named Donald J. Trump.  I think that you’re going to do very well.  (Applause.)\nThey’re saying that November 5th — Election Day — 2024, will go down as one of the most important days in the history of our country.  They said, “In 129 years, the most consequential election.”  I don’t know if they’re right about that or not, but it sounds good.  I wanted to see if I could get a couple of more years tacked on, but I figured the fight wasn’t really worth it.  One hundred and twenty-nine is a lot.\nAnd as of January 20th, 2025, the dark days of high taxes, crushing regulations, rampant inflation, flagrant corruption, government weaponization — ooh, I know about weaponization — and total incompetence will be gone forever.  Will be gone forever.  (Applause.)  Because the United States is back and open for business, and the golden age of America has officially begun.  You see it happening.  (Applause.)\nSince my election, America’s economic engines have come roaring back to life in just a very short period of time.  Think of it.  From November 5th, the — the progress that’s been made has been amazing.  The Nasdaq is up nearly 10 percent in just a few months, and that’s a lot.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2,200 points.\nAnd Bitcoin has set multiple all-time record highs, because everyone knows that I’m committed to making America the crypto capital.  We want to stay — we want to stay at the forefront of everything, and one of them is crypto.  And Miami seems to be the center of the action, come to think of it, and maybe it’ll stay there.\nBusiness optimism skyrocketed 42 points — think of that — in a single month.  The most in history, by far.  That’s the biggest increase in history by not even close.\nThe ISM index of manufacturing activity surged into positive territory for the first time in many years.  Amazing.\nAnd it was just announced — this is an interesting one.  I didn’t realize it was that bad for so long.  But it was just announced by one of the nation’s most historically accurate and respected pollsters, Rasmussen, that the number of Americans who believe our country is on the right track now exceeds those who think it’s heading in the wrong direction for the first time in 20 years.  Can you believe you that?  Twenty years.  (Applause.)  And this is really a seismic 27-point swing from just before the election.  That’s — nobody has ever seen anything like that one, Yasir.  I want to tell you.  That’s a big one.  (Laughter.)\nThe best and most successful business leaders on Earth are now racing to invest in the United States.  Since November, DAMAC has announced plans to invest $40 billion in the U.S., creating at least 10,000 jobs.  SoftBank has announced investments of between $100- and $200 billion, creating at least 100,000 American jobs.  Oracle and OpenAI and SoftBank are now collectively committing $500 billion to keep the United States on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.\nAnd so many more — I mean, so many companies, they want to come to the White House and have a little news conference all the time.  I said, “Why don’t you just announce it?”  But they want to come, and I’ll do that.  I don’t mind doing that.  I say anytime they want to go $10 billion or more, I’m — I’m there.  (Laughter and applause.)  Ten billion or more.\nBut on his recent visit to the White House, the prime minister of Japan announced he anticipates Japanese investment in the United States of well over a trillion dollars, and we’re working on an Alaska pipeline already, which is the closest point to Asia.\nAnd as you know, the ANWR, which we’ve started, Ronald Reagan couldn’t get it approved.  Nobody could get it approved for so many years.  Couldn’t get it approved.  I got it approved.  Actually, I got it approved twice.  I got it approved, and Biden ended it.  That was a shocker.  But we just got it approved again.  And we’re going to be — (applause) — it’s — it’s probably the largest deposit maybe anywhere in the world, just by itself.  It’s — they say of similar size to Saudi Arabia, so we hope that’s correct.\nBut all of this is only happening because of the world-changing results of the 2024 election.  We won the House.  We won the Senate, the White House, and the Electoral College and the popular vote in a landslide.  We also won all seven swing states, and all 50 states shifted in the Republican direction for the first time ever.  So, every state — every single state of the 50 states shifted Republican.  That’s never happened before.  Either way, it’s never happened.\nAnd 85 percent of counties voted for Trump.  Think of that.  So, you have 2,600 counties versus 525.  Two thousand six hundred, think of that.  That’s why when you look at the election map, after it was all done — the certified map — the whole thing was red — 2,600 versus 500.  It’s a big, big dif- — nobody’s seen anything like it, actually.\nSo, as a result of this very historic victory, investors from all over the planet, once again, have confidence in America’s future and respect for America’s leaders, and it’s about time we get a little respect.\nThe last administration was the worst and most incompetent in the history of our country, but we are moving quickly to fix every single disaster Joe Biden created and make America stronger and more prosperous than ever before.  (Applause.)\nOur first and most urgent mission is to remove the criminals that Biden allowed into our country with the ridiculous and very dangerous open-borders policy.  They came from all over the world.  They came from prisons and jails.  They came from mental institutions and insane asylums.  They were gang members.  They were drug lords.  They came from all over, and they were allowed to come into our country.  And we’re getting them out in record levels, just like they came in in record levels.\nI want to thank Tom Homan and Kristi, who is just doing — she’s doing a fantastic job — governor of South Dakota — and Tom Homan, you know, and they are doing a fantastic job.  (Applause.)  And the results are incredible.\nAnd every country is taking them back.  They’re sending their criminals to us, and they’re all taking them back.  We had a little problem with a couple of them.  That ended very quickly.  And because some said, “We don’t really want MS-13 back in our country.”  But I said, “Congratulations, you’re taking them back,” and they take them back.\nAnd, by the way, Europe and other places ought to start also doing that.  They better start looking at immigration, because it’s really hurting Europe very, very badly.  And they better get smart and they better get tough before it’s too late.\nWe’re also working to end the highest inflation in our country’s history, all caused because they played with our energy policy and wasted money on the Green New Scam and other things such as that, and they wasted monies at — at never-seen-before levels.  If Joe Biden had simply held federal spending at the pre-pandemic levels we had in 2019, we — right now, we would have virtually no inflation.\nWe’re trying to balance the budget immediately, and because of the tariff income, which is really go- — it’s — it’s already turned out to be amazing, actually.  It’s really meant more for bringing countries and companies into our country, but it’s — the numbers are rather staggering, because we’re the big piggy bank that everybody wants to be.  And they can play games, and they can say, “Well, there’ll be retribution and, you know, equal this and that,” but they can’t be equal.\nBut we want to keep it so that we’re the big piggy bank.  And if we had years like we did the last four years, that wouldn’t have lasted too long.  So, we’re not promising it, but you know, all of these things could happen.  We — we hope to balance our budget.\nSo, I don’t want to promise it, because if I do and we come about $10 short, the fake news media back there would say, “We have breaking news.  He did not make it.  He did not make it.”\nBut we’ll get it done very soon.  It might not be this year, but it could be this year.  Actually, we have a chance at getting it even this year, which people would be shocked at, because they were talking about 10 years, 15 years, 20 years from now.\nWhen I took office last month, we inherited the consequences of inflation that was more than four times what it was when I left four years ago.  Think of that, I left, it was at 1.4 percent.  And the annual government spending over $1.5 trillion more than projected in 2020 alone — $1.5 trillion.\nBut under the Trump administration, all of that is changing faster and more dramatically than anyone ever thought possible.  They didn’t think it was possible to do what we’ve done in just a very short period of time.  We’ve accomplished more in four weeks than most administrations accomplish in four years.\nOn my first day in office, I imposed an immediate federal hiring freeze, a federal regulation freeze, and a foreign aid freeze.\nI signed an order creating the Department of Government Efficiency and put a man named Elon Musk in charge.  Thank you, Elon, for doing it.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.\nAnd he’s doing a great job.  I wish you could have seen him last night.  It’s really — you know, he’s a very committed person.  He’s a very serious person.  And he’s a very high-IQ people.\nYou know, I like high-IQ people.  Not all have to be, but, you know, it’d be nice to have some people up there that — (laughter) — he’s a seriously high-IQ individual.  Now, he’s got his faults also, I will tell you that — (laughter) — but not too many of them.\nWhich is now really waging war on government waste, fraud, and abuse, and they’re curbing inflation and saving taxpayers billions and billions of dollars every single day.  And there’s even under consideration a new concept where we give 20 percent of the DOGE savings to American citizens and 20 percent goes to paying down debt, because the numbers are incredible, Elon.  So many billions of dollars — it’s billions — hundreds of billions, and we’re thinking about giving 20 percent back to the American citizens and 20 percent down to pay back debt — and pay down debt, which is — if you look at value, if it were a real estate balance sheet, the debt is tiny, but we still — we still want to pay it down.  Doesn’t matter.  We don’t look at it as a piece of real estate.  It’s America.  We’re going to get it down through intelligence, hard work, and, as Elon said, a word called “caring.”  You have to have — you have to care.\nBy doing this, Americans will tell us where there is waste.  They’ll be reporting it themselves.  They participate in the process of saving money.\nSo many of the men and women in this room, as an example, they pay tremendous amounts of taxes.  And here are just a few examples of where your money was going before I came along.  These are just some of the — just taken at random.  Oh, there are much worse examples than this.  I was just looking at them before the speech, and I can tell you there were much worse.  And there are some that are horrible, but I don’t want to really say them, because they’re very, very embarrassing to people — very, very embarrassing.  And they’re really something, but you’ll be seeing it and you will be reading about it.\nBut just some taking at random:\n$2 million for sex change operations in Guatemala.\n$20 million for “Sesame Street” performances in Iraq.  Twenty million, that’s a lot of money.  (Laughter.)  You know, I know what it costs to do those things.  You get a cast over for $50,000, give them a couple of bucks tip.  That’s it.  Not $20 million.  (Laughter.)  Twenty million, that’s “Gone With the Wind” on steroids.  (Laughter.)\n$101 million for 29 diversity, equity, and inclusion contracts at the Department of Education.  Wow.\nAnd we’ve also canceled — we’ve canceled all of these, saved all of this money.  And, again, this is just a small sample.  This could go on.  I could read them all day.\n$520 million for a consultant — I want to know who is that consultant — (laughter) — to do ESG — that’s environmental, social, and governance — investments in Africa.\n$25 million to promote biodiversity conservation and licit livelihoods by developing socially responsible behavior in Colombia.\n$40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants.  Nobody knows what that even means.  None of this stuff.  Nobody.  (Laughter.)  Everyone is trying to figure out, “What the hell does it all mean?”\n$42 million for social and behavior changes in Uganda.  Forty million is a lot of newspaper ads in Uganda.  (Laughter.)\n$70 million for research of evidence-based solutions for development challenges.\n$10 million for Mozambique medical male circumcision.  (Laughter.)  What does that — what does that mean?\n$2.3 million dollars for strengthening independent voices in Cambodia.  (Laughter.)\n$14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia.\n$486 million to the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening, including $22 million for inclusion — inclusive and participatory political process in Moldova and $21 million for voter turnout in India.  What do we need to spend $21 million for voter turnout in India?  Wow, $21 million.  I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected.  Wow, we ought to tell the Indian government, because when we hear that Russia spent about two dollars in our country, it was a big deal.  Right?  (Laughter.)  They took — they took some Internet ads for $2,000.  This is a total breakthrough: twenty-one million dollars for India elections.\n$29 million to strengthen the political landscape in Bangladesh.\n$20 million for fiscal federalism, and $19 million in addition to the $21 million, for biodiversity conversion [conservation] in Nepal.\n$1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia.  We need voter confidence too, when you read this list.  (Laughter.)\n$14 million for social cohesion in Mali.\n$2.5 million for inclusive democracies in South Africa.\n$47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia.  Asia is doing very well.  We don’t need to give them money.  (Laughter.)\nAnd in another program, $50 million, plus another $50 million, for condoms for Hamas.  You know about that?  (Laughter.)  A hundred million dollars for condoms.  Condoms.  Does everybody know what a condom is?  (Laughter.)  For Hamas — $100 million.\nAnd these are just some.  I could read this list all day long.  I just don’t want to bore you.  But these are just some, and not nearly as bad as others.  And some are just — I just don’t want to say them because they’re too — they’re too incenduary [incendiary].\nWe’re also finding tremendous abuse, waste, and fraud in Social Security.  Social Security is — what’s happening there is going to be one of the great potential scandals in history.\nOn the program, there are over 4.7 million Social Security numbers from people from 100 years old to 109.  Think of that.  Now, over 100, there aren’t a lot of people that make it.  Hopefully most of the people in this room will make it, but historically, you don’t have thousands and thousands of people.  But listen to this: 3.6 million people are on Social Security rolls from the age of 110 years old to 119.  Do you think there are really that many?  (Laughter.)  Those people are seriously old.  (Laughter.)  But it gets worse.\n3.47 million — 3.47 million people are on Social Security from the age of 120 years old to 129 years old.\n3.9 million people are on the age of Social Security from 130 years old to 139 years old.  Now the all-time record, I heard, is a woman who was a hundred — she was 127 years old.  That’s the record.  A woman from a certain country where they have actually people that live pretty long, actually.  And she was 127 years old.  That’s pretty old, but we’re topping her by millions — millions of people.  (Laughter.)\n3.5 million people from the age 140 to 149 years old.\n1.3 million people are on Social Security from the age 150 to 159.\nAnd over 130,000 people are on Social Security over the age of 160 years old — okay? — including 1,039 people — think of it — over 1,000 people — between the ages of 220 to 229.  (Laughter.)  And one person between the age of 240 to 249.\nAnd the record-topper: There is one person on Social Security who is 360 years old — (laughter) — which is approximately 110 years older than our country.  (Laughter and applause.)\nSo, what we’re trying to find out and what we will find out is are people being paid from all of these.  You know, is somebody pocketing $10,000 here, $10,000 there?  What’s going on?  So, we’ll find that out pretty easily because we have a lot of computer geniuses.\nI said to Elon, “Who are these people that are doing this, the DOGE people?”  I said, “Who are they?  Where do they come from?”  He said, “Well, number one, they love our country, and, number two, they’re really genius at computers.”  So, nobody is going to fool them.  When they go in, they see some bureaucrat that’s scamming the country, and they try and talk about, you know, certain computer language, these people say, “No, it doesn’t work that way.”  These are people that are — have a natural ability as — as, you know, brilliant computer people.\nIt was very interesting when he told me that.  I said, “That’s what you need today.”\nBut all of these scams have now been terminated.\nIn addition, over the past month, we have effectively eliminated the U.S. Agency for International Development, which was funding much of this lunacy.  We virtually shut down the out-of-control CFPB, escorting radical-left bureaucrats out of the building and locking the doors behind them.  What they were doing was so terrible.  Where they were spending the money was so terrible.\nWhat we haven’t looked at yet but will be is does the money come back to them, because nobody can be stupid like that.  And they’re not stupid.  They’re smart, actually.  And, you know, why are doing that?  Does money come back to them?  So, we’ll figure that out pretty easily, I think, and quickly.\nBut I’ve ended all of the so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion programs across the entire federal government and private sector and notified every single government DEI officer that their jobs have been deleted.  They’re all deleted.  And it’s interesting, even these country — these companies that have tremendous — the amounts of money — a number of them just announced — Walmart, if you can believe it, they just announced that they’re stopping.\nAnd, you know, these companies are writing off, like, $220 million.  How can you spend that much money no matter what you’re doing?  If you’re teaching something, you’re going to have an instructor, you’re going to talk, you’re going to give them a book, “Please read the book.”  You know, and then you find they spent $225 million on that.  What’s going on?\nAnd we were going in the wrong way, and our military was really — although, I tell you, you know, we — we defeated ISIS with our military in three weeks.  General “Razin” Caine was — he’s some general.  He’s a real general, not a television general.  And three weeks — ISIS.  And I — I asked him, and I saw some of his people that were so great, the soldiers.  We have the greatest military in the world, but we don’t have the greatest top, top leadership.  That’s why Afghanistan was such a horrible situation and so embarrassing and so many other things.\nBut when we want to, with proper leadership, there’s nobody even close to us.  We have the best equipment in the world.  We make the best equipment in the world.  But we have the best military, but, you know, we never fight to win.  We fight to just keep it going forever.  And when we fight to win, there’s nobody that can even come close to us.\nBut I was talking to General Dan Caine, and we call him “Razin” Caine.  And I was told it would take about four years to defeat ISIS, and he did it in three weeks.  I said to him, “What do you think, General?  How long will it take?”  “Sir, I think we should do it in less than four weeks.  You’re going to have time leftover.”  And he did.  He did that.  And we were told by the television generals it would take four years.\nSo, we did it.  That’s when I went to Iraq.  I flew to Iraq and — late at night — the dark of night, all the windows closed, all the lights off in the plane, in Air Force One.  And we flew in, and it was pretty amazing.  I’ll tell you, we were landing, and there were no lights.  No lights on the plane.  “Sir, we have to turn off all lights.”  I said, “You mean we spend $9 trillion, and we have to fly in on Air Force One with the lights off?”  And I went up to the pilot and said hello.\nAnd, by the way, these guys are like central casting.  These are the best-looking human beings.  Everybody is, like, perfect.  (Laughter.)  The most handsome people, the best-looking people you’ve ever seen, with the flattops and the whole thing.\nAnd I was a little concerned because the lights are off, and everything is off, and even the lights in where he was were down very dim — very, very dim with all of the lights on the fancy dashboards of the plane of Air Force One.\nWe’re getting a new Air Force One if they can ever finish the damn thing.  (Laughter.)  We’re getting two of them, actually.  But we may have to go a different route because it’s taking them a long time.  We’re going to get military that’s going to start building.  We’re going to get people to start building properly again in our country, because they don’t build properly.  (Applause.)  This was Boeing.\nBut we’re — we’re up there, and I’m looking at these people.  And, again, cent- — I say they look like Tom Cruise but better — (laughter) — stronger, tougher.  And I like Tom Cruise, but these are better.  And I said — I said, “Are we okay, Captain?”  “Yes, sir, we’re fine.”  But I’m looking out.  I don’t see any lights, and we’re landing. And I’m — you know, I’m used to that.  I like to sit with the pilots a lot, and I respect the pilots greatly.\nAnd we’re up there, and, you know, we have the computer — I call it the computer voice, where it goes 1,000, 900, 800.  That’s feet — your feet above ground.  So, that means you’re very low.  And I’m looking out, and my eyes are pretty good, and I don’t see any lights.  And the computer goes out.  It sounds like a — an intelligent individual.  It goes, “1,000.”  We’re a thousand feet up.  That’s very — it’s a 10-story building.  This is a big, big plane.  And then it goes, “900, 800, 700.”  I say, “Captain.”  (Clears throat.)  (Laughter.)  “Captain, we don’t see any lights.”  I said, “Is everything” — “Yes, sir.  Everything is fine, sir.  We’ll be landing in three minutes.”\nAnd then it goes, like, “600, 500.”  “Captain, are we okay?”  (Laughter.)  And then it goes, “400, 300, 200.”  And I’m saying, “Man, there’s nothing out there.”  (Laughter.)\nAnd then he goes boom.  Perfect landing, right on this thing.  There are no lights on the runway.  There’s no n- — I don’t know how the hell they do it, but I’m sure as hell glad we had somebody that knows how to fly.  (Laughter.)\nBut they didn’t want to have any lights because they didn’t want the enemy — after spending, you know, years and trillions of dollars, we have to land with Air Force One with no lights on the runway.  But they were incredible people.\nAnd then I got out of the plane, and I actually asked my people — you know, I said, “Excuse me, I was very brave sitting in that cockpit.  Am I allowed to give myself the Congressional Medal of Honor?”  (Laughter and applause.)  And they said, “I don’t think so, sir.”  I said, “Well, I felt I was extremely brave.”  (Laughter.)\nBut now here’s the problem with saying a story like that.  When you kid, the press will say, “President Donald Trump wanted to give himself the Congressional Medal of Honor.”  (Laughter.)   Headlines, you know?  Headlines all over the fake news.  We call it the fake news, but we’re all wise to them.\nBut it was something.\nAnd then I went down, and it was the same thing.  I’m standing on the top, and I look down and there’s these handsome people.  Everybody is like from a movie set.  Good-looking guys.  I get down the stairs, and “What’s your name?”  “My name is Caine, sir.”  “What’s your first name?”  “They call me ‘Razin.’”  I say, “Wait a minute.  Your name is Razin Caine?  I love you.  I’ve been looking for you for five years.  You are the grea-” — (laughter) — “This is what I want.”\nAnd there was a general next to him.  There was a colonel.  There was a drill sergeant, a master sergeant.  They were all, like, people — I could make a movie right now.  I’d have the best-looking people ever.  And they were great.\nAnd then I went in, and “Sir, would you like to rest before the me-” — “No, I don’t want to rest.  I don’t want to rest.  I’ve been resting on the plane,” other than the last few moments, which were quite harrowing.  (Laughter.)  And I said, “I don’t want to rest.”  He was thinking about Biden in advance, you know?  Biden would have gone there; he would have rested for days.  (Laughter.)  They — and then they wouldn’t have had a meeting.  He’d just go home.  (Laughter.)\nNo, I said, “I don’t want to rest.  I don’t want to rest at all.  I want to go.”\nSo, we went into this, like, bunker, and we had a lot of very good, talented people.  And that’s when I asked him.  I said, “You know, I’m hearing it’s going to take a long time.”  “No, that’s not right, sir.  It’s not going to take a long time.  We’ll have it done in four weeks.”  I said, “How can you say four weeks when, in Washington, they said four years?”  He said, “It’s four weeks, sir.  We’ll hit them left.  We’ll hit them right.  We’ll hit them up the center.  We’ll hit them underground and overground.  We’ll knock the hell out of them, sir.”\nAnd I said, “Why is it that they said so long?”  He said, “Because they wouldn’t let us fight, and we’re very far away.  They want us to fight for this — from this airport.  We’re very, very far away, sir, and they want us to fight here.  We have many substations out” — sub-airports, they call them.  Remote airports, where they build them in the sand.  “And we have many of them, and I’d use them all, sir, and I would hit them so hard from so many different directions.”\nI said, “Well, what do you think?”  He said, “You just let me know.”  And I called him back, and I said, “Go ahead and do it.  Are you sure you can do this, General?”  He said, “Yes, sir.”  And he did it, actually, in three weeks.  It was over.  A hundred percent of people that are really hurting the Middle East, hurting the world — and it was done.\nAnd we have — I’m telling you, we have the greatest military in the world, but you have to use the right people.  But there’s nothing like what they were able to do in that case.  And in other cases, wherever I gave them something, it was done incredibly well and very — and you know many of the instances, because it’s been well reported.\nBut we’ve also required — and we ha- — so, we have a country that’s a great country.  It’s a strong country, but it’s a country that’s just now gaining its respect back to the levels that it should — should have never lost.  We were being laughed at by the entire world, but we’re not being laughed at anymore.\nBut we’ve also required that all federal employees must once again show up to work.  This is a new phenomenon, you know, since COVID.  (Applause.)  Show up to work in person like the rest of us.  So, I mean, it doesn’t work when you don’t show up.\nAnd I see companies now are all going back to it.  They’re all going back.  It’s great.  I want some of the big business leaders saying, “We absolutely are going back.”  You — you j- — you can’t work at home.  They’re not working.  They’re playing tennis, they’re playing golf, or they have other jobs, but they’re not working — or they’re certainly not working hard.  You could never build a company or a country with that.\nSo, we have a very strong policy.  And if they don’t show up to work, they — they get fired.\nAnd we’re trying to make our government smaller but much stronger.  And we have tremendous bureaucracy, but it’s happening.  A lot of people are leaving and, in some cases, leaving with pretty good offers.  You know, you’re paid seven or eight months and go out, find a job.  But some of these people had jobs.  They were actually working for us, but they also had other jobs.  And those people, in theory, they have problems.  I don’t know if we’re going to do anything about that.  So, we have other things to do, but they were working other jobs instead of working for us.  So, they were staying home working, but they were working other jobs, getting paid a lot of money, perhaps.\nWe offered deferred resignation buyouts to all federal workers, resulting in more than 75,000 bureaucrats voluntarily surrendering their taxpayer-funded jobs.  A lot of them are leaving because they don’t want to be caught having the second job, some are leaving because they didn’t want to be in government any longer, and — and some are leaving because they didn’t want to show up to work.  They wanted to work outside of an office, and that’s never going to work for anybody, including companies.  The companies ought to get smart.\nYou watch these companies where they do that: They start going bad.  Nobody knows — “what’s wrong with this company?”  Well, try getting the people back into the office where they can be cohesive and together.\nIn less than a single month, the Department of Government Efficiency has already saved over 55- — this is just a short period of time — $55 billion, and we’re just getting started.  That’s nothing compared to the numbers that you’re talking about, right?  (Applause.)\nWe’re ending trillions of dollars in waste, and it’ll mean much lower inflation; lower interest rates; lower payments on mortgages, credit cards, car loans; and much higher stock markets.  I think the stock market is going to be great.  In other words, we will rapidly grow our economy by dramatically shrinking the federal government, and we have to do it.\nI’m also taking fast action to end the radical left’s nation-wrecking crusade against oil and natural gas.  Over the past four years, the Biden administration cut the number of new oil leases and gas leases by 95 percent.  They slowed new pipeline.\nI mean, look at the — any one.  Dakota Access, they wanted that one knocked out.  The Keystone Pipeline, they wanted that one knocked out.  They ended the Keystone.  We got the Dakota Access done, but it wasn’t easy after they tried to stop it.\nThey slowed new oil and gas pipeline construction to virtually a halt.  They shut down 38 percent of active oil and gas rigs in the United States.\nBut they love the wind turbines.  They go round and round and round.  And if the wind doesn’t blow, they got problems.  They kill all the birds.  They ruin the sight lines.  They ruin the plains and the beautiful areas of our country, including the oceans, the lakes.\nThey closed more than 50 power plants, all causing energy prices to skyrocket.  You saw that happen.  That’s what caused the inflation.  It’s pretty easy.\nThese policies were so destructive that despite draining nearly 40 percent of U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve meant for emergencies — it was meant for emergencies.  It wasn’t meant for getting the price of gasoline down so that you can win an election.  Didn’t work for winning the election.  Actually, there’s so many people that are driving that it’s a very small number.  It just had a very small effect.  But in the meantime, it takes it down.  It’s at — now it’s at the lo- — we’ll fill it up fast, but it’s at the lowest level.\nWhen we made the transition, it was at the lowest level in history ever recorded.  It’s the lowest level.  Nobody’s ever seen it that way.  They — they put it all out because they thought they could keep gasoline prices down a little bit.  Just go past the election, and then after that, they didn’t care.  And it didn’t work, because they didn’t get elected.  I got elected.\nBut the price of gasoline still rose over 35 percent and, in some cases, at some periods, it was 100 percent and 125 percent during certain periods of time.\nUnder the Trump administration, we have implemented a very different plan.  You probably heard of it.  It’s called drill, baby, drill, and we’re doing a — (applause).\nThe world runs on low-cost energy, and energy-producing nations like us have nothing to apologize for.  We have more energy than any other nation in the world, and we’re going to use it.  And we’re going to use it on AI plants.\nI was telling some of the people that came in that — you know, they’re very inter- — everybody’s talking about AI.  I hope you’re right.  You know, I don’t know.  Who knows?  (Laughter.)\nBut, Elon, are they right?  Are they right in going all i- — they are all in for AI.\nBut the problem is, to do it, just in our country, you need twice the electricity just to open up and be the top of AI.  You need twice the electricity that we have right now.  In the entire country, if you take all of the electricity, you need more than twice.  You need twice.  You need double what we have right now just to fuel this new industry that’s growing.  I was amazed when I heard that number.\nAnd they all said, “How can we do this?”  Because, you know, in China and various other places, you can probably get it with the shake of a hand, but in our country, you can’t.\nBut now you can, because we’ve declared — I’m declaring a national emergency in order to get fast approvals.  And we’re going to have — if you build a plant, you’re able to build an electric-generating facility right next to your plant, so you’ll be making your own.  You won’t have to count on utilities.  You won’t have to count on an old grid that could fail, could get hit by something — bad things or good things — but you’re not going to have to — you’re not going to have to worry about grids.  You’re not going to have — you’ll build your plant, and you’ll build your — your — essentially, you become a utility, in a way.  You build your own electricity.  If you want to build extra and put it out and get paid for that, you’re going to be able to do that.  You could put it back into the grid, but you’re going to be able to build with your plant a generating facility.\nAnd we’re going to get you Lee Zeldin, head of the environment — head of Environmental — the Environmental group — various groups.  And we’ve got them unified now, but we’re going to get you very fast approvals, and they’ll be approved so fast your head will spin.  And we’re going to get that whole industry started, and we’re going to be the head of it.  We’re leading right now.  We have the greatest brain power.  We’re leading right now, and I expect that we’re going to be leading by a lot.\nBut we’re going to get you the energy very, very quickly.  That would be the one thing that everybody was concerned, “How do we have that much electricity when Los Angeles has blackouts and brownouts right now, and there’s a lack of electricity?”  But we’re going to get it at levels never seen before.\nI ended the ridiculous Green New Scam, halting tens of billions of dollars of wasteful deficit spending.  And I withdrew the United States from the unfair, one-sided Paris Climate Accord.\nAnd I ended Joe Biden’s insane electric vehicle mandate, because it was just insane.  I repealed the last — and, by the way, if you want to buy an electric car, that’s great.  If you want to buy a gasoline-driven car or a hybrid, it’s great.  Whatever the — whatever the thing happens to be.\nI heard hydrogen is hot.  The problem is, when it’s not, you’re in deep trouble.  Because when that sucker blows up, they don’t find the body.  (Laughter.)  So, that’s one that I said, “You know what?  Let’s take a pass on that one.”  They said it’s good, but when it’s bad, it’s really bad.  You find the bodies on trees — on the side of a tree.  (Laughter.)  I said, “I think we’ll pass on that one.  Right?  We’re not going to want that one.”  But you never know.  Maybe someday it’ll be good.  But it doesn’t sound like it’s off to a good start.\nI repealed the last administration’s very destructive natural gas export ban, and, last week, we approved our first new liquefied natural gas export license, and we have literally hundreds of people that want to export.\nI recently met with the Japanese prime minister, Ishiba, to discuss large increases in American oil and gas exports.  They want it so badly.  They said, “We went to the Biden administration, and they wouldn’t sell it.  They wouldn’t sell it.”  Nobody knows why.  Biden didn’t know why either.  They asked him.  “I don’t know.”  (Laughter.)  “He wanted — they did?  Oh, I didn’t know that.”\nBut we’re going to sell it.  And the new project in Alaska is going to feed all of Asia.  We’re going to take care of all of Asia.  We have so much oil and gas, like very few people — like very few countries have — like, really, actually, no country has.\nI also met with Prime Minister Modi of India, who wants to greatly expand India’s purchase of American energy.\nAnd my administration has also launched the most aggressive deregulation program of any nation in history.  Under my executive order, for every 1 new regulation added, 10 old regulations have to be eliminated.  (Applause.)\nAnd, you know, in our first term, which was actually an incredible success — we had the greatest economy in history until COVID, and even after that, we did great.  The stock market was higher.  If you think of it, it was higher after the fact — after we went through that whole thing, it was higher than it was just prior to COVID coming in, which is a pretty amazing thing.\nBut we did a great job on that, but it was a terrible thing for the world.  The whole world suffered.  It suffered terribly, including China, including other countries.  It just was a terrible period of time.\nBut despite that, we did well.  But we had the greatest economy in the history of our country, and I think this time we’re going to do even better.  We had — we were artificially hurt by COVID.  We had to focus on that instead of focusing on — but just prior to COVID coming in, there’s never been anything like what we did, what we achieved.  And even after, we did very well con- — and especially considering what all of us had to do with COVID.  Some nations were hit so badly, it was — it was just unbelievable what happened to them.\nAs part of our effort, I’ve signed executive orders to keep the United States at the forefront of artificial intelligence and to end Joe Biden’s war on Bitcoin and crypto.  We ended that war totally.  That war is over.  They were very hostile toward them until the very end, just because there are so many people on Bitcoin and crypto that — just before the end, the SEC came out, and they were being very nice.  I was so nice to people, because so many people were being indicted for no reason whatsoever — very political group of people.  That’s all they did was they liked indicting people.\nBut they were being indicted, and many of those indictments were dropped just before the election because they said, “Wait a minute.  There’s 100 million, 125 million people using this,” and they didn’t want to have, you know, all these people being — voting against.  But by the time they did that, it was too late.  We had that vote entirely, I think.  I think anybody would — smart that believed in that, and there were a lot of people believing it — anybody that was smart voted for Trump.\nAnd they pulled the indictments.  And I see people that were indicted.  I said, “I saved your life.  I saved your life.”  Because if they thought that — they actually thought that I was doing — they said, “Why is Trump doing it?  Is he doing it for political reasons?”  I don’t do anything for political reasons.  I do what’s right.  I do — I want to be on the forefront of every industry.  (Applause.)\nSo, I’ll be working with the Republican Congress to pass the largest tax cuts in American history.  And that includes, obviously — (applause) — yeah.  That includes we have to extend the Trump tax cuts, which were, until now, the largest.\nWe’re going to dramatically cut taxes for families and for workers and for companies, including no tax on tips and hopefully no tax on Social Security and no tax on overtime.  And that overtime one is a sleeper, because I think a lot of people are going to be spurred on to do a lot of extra work.  When they hear that, it’s — a lot of companies really like it and a lot of people really like it.\nThe new Trump tax cuts will also include 100 percent expensing for new factory construction in the United States and anything else that you’re going to buy with capital.  If you buy something — if you buy something that is going to be good for our country, we’re going to let you expense it — one-year expense.  (Applause.)  And I did that the first time, and everybody was saying, “Can you go back to that?”  Now you still get, I guess, 40 percent or whatever, but it, you know, pares down.  But we’re going to bring that right up to the — to the top level.  I think that had a lot to do with the success that I had during my first term.\nAnd we’ll substantially cut taxes for all domestic producers of oil and gas and just about everything else that they produce.\nIn my first term, I brought the business tax down from around 40 percent to 21 percent, which everybody said was an impossible thing to do.  I cut it from 40 or — it actually — with state and city, it was much higher than 40, but I got it down to 21 percent.  And now I’m bringing it down to a goal of 15 percent, but only if you make your product in America.  In other words, you’re going to be at 21 percent, but if you make your product in America, you’re going to go from 21 to 15.  If you don’t, you’re going to pay 21 percent, which is still lower than anything.  (Applause.)\nSo, guys like Elon are going to come and make his great cars in the United States.  There — a lot of — a lot of people will.  A lot of people are calling.  A lot of car companies are calling.  They called me — three of them.  Three of the majors, they called, and they said, “We’re looking all over the place.  We want to be there.”\nI’m going to be announcing tariffs on cars and semiconductors and chips and pharmaceuticals — drugs and pharmaceuticals and lumber, probably, and some other things over the next month or sooner, and it’s going to have a big impact on America.  We’re bringing our businesses back.\nIf they don’t make their product in America, then they — very simply, they have to pay a tariff.  But if they do make their product in America, they ha- — they don’t have to pay any tariff, which will bring — it’s all going to bring trillions of dollars into our Treasury, or it’s going to mean that there won’t be any taxes because we won’t have a fair base.  If they don’t have it, we don’t have it.  If they don’t pay — if they don’t charge us, we don’t charge them.  It’s pretty simple.\nThe Republican Party is, once again, the party of common sense.  We’re a party of common sense.  We want strong borders.  We don’t want men playing in women’s sports.  We don’t want to have transgender for everybody.  We’re the party of common sense.  That’s how we won the election in such a big manner.\nWe’ll no longer allow other countries to ransack and plunder our nation.  That’s why I’ve announced that we will soon begin imposing reciprocal tariffs on any country that engages in unfair and unequal trading practices.  If they tariff us, as I said, we will tariff them at the exact same rate.  So, if a certain country — because some of these countries, even countries that I’ve already mentioned, are extremely aggressive with tariffs.  Nobody knows that.\nThe European Union, they have a VAT tax that’s devastating.  It’s very tough for people on the outside.  Hard to sell cars.  Really impossible to sell them, because they also have nonmonetary tariffs that are very, very tough.  But if you take a look at that, it’s a very unfair situation.  And the VAT tax is similar to the tariff.\nAround the world, I’m moving quickly to end wars, settle conflicts, and restore the planet to peace.  I want peace, and I don’t want to see these — everybody being killed.  And you take a look at the death in the Middle East and the death that’s taking place between Russia and Ukraine that’s been going on, and we’re going to end it.\nThere’s no profit for anyone in having World War III, and you’re not so far away from it.  I’ll tell you right now, you’re not so far away.  If we would have had this administration for another year, you would have been in World War III, and now it’s not going to happen.\nIn the Middle East, I’ve restored my policy of maximum pressure on Iran, designed to — to bring peace.  (Applause.)  And we’ve designated the Houthis a terrorist organization.  They’re, you know, destroying shipping lanes all over the place.  They’re making it very hard for people to get their product delivered.  They’re making it very difficult.  But we’ll take care of that situation.\nAnd we’ve secured a ceasefire in Gaza, and we’re bringing in the hostages, and we’re bringing them home to their families.  Some of them are in pretty bad shape, I have to tell you.\nTo end the horrible war in Ukraine, I have spoken with President Putin and President Zelenskyy, and our teams began negotiations this week in Saudi Arabia.  I want to thank Saudi Arabia for that.  That was so great.  (Applause.)  Yeah.\nAnd I want to thank, in particular — I mean, we have so many of the people — Yasir, Mohammed, all the people — but — but, in particular, we have to thank Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for hosting these historic talks — (applause) — and talks that went very, very well.\nSteve was there — Steve Witkoff was there, and Michael was there — Michael Waltz — and others.  And they really went well.  It’s a big — it’s a big step.  We’ve got to get that war over with.\nYou have to see the people that are dying.  I look at the pictures, the — the satellite pictures of the field.  It’s a level field, and it looks like a modern-day version of Gettysburg, and you know what that means.  It is just carnage.  It’s horrible.\nAnd, you know, it’s not American soldiers.  It’s not even soldiers from the Middle East, in the case of Ukraine-Russia, but it’s people.  It’s young people from Russia and Ukraine, mostly, that are just being decimated.  It’s flat fields, and a bullet goes, and a bullet only stops when it hits somebody.  And the level of people being killed in that battle — soldiers, young soldiers — in some cases, old soldiers, because they’re running out of people; they’re running out of soldiers, one case.\nBut think of it, a modestly successful comedian, President Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion to go into a war that basically couldn’t be won, that never had to start, and never would have started if I was president — not even a chance.  And it didn’t start for four years.  Never would have started.\nBut a war that he, without the U.S. and Trump, will never be able to settle.  They’ll never settle that war without our involvement.  That’s why they did such a great job this weekend.  That’s why Saudi Arabia did such a great job this weekend in hosting.\nThe United States has spent $200 billion more than Europe, and Europe’s money is guaranteed.  They get their money back.  It’s a form of a loan.  Nobody knows that.  I know that.  I said, “Why isn’t somebody saying, you know, we do it the same way?”  And we spent much more money.  We have to equalize.\nBut while the United States gets nothing back — so, they get their money back.  It’s a loan.  We just give our money.\nAnd we had a deal based on rare earth and things, but they broke that deal.  But we — they broke it two days ago.  We had a deal, because I said, “We’re spending $350 billion, and Europe gets their money back in the form of a loan and we don’t.  We’re just giving the money hand over fist.”  That’s the Biden administration for you.  But they’re no longer dealing with the same United States as they were dealing with a few months ago.  Why didn’t crooked Joe Biden demand equalization?\nAnd that this war is far more important to Europe than it is to us, and that there’s a very big, beautiful ocean as separation.  This is — you know, we’re helping Europe.  We’re trying to help Europe.\nOn top of this, Zelenskyy admits that half of the money that we sent them is missing.  They don’t know where the money is.  He said, “Well, we don’t know where half of it is.”  That’s great.  Wonderful.  (Laughter.)\nHe refuses to have elections.  He’s low in the real Ukrainian polls.  I mean, how can you be high with every city is being demolished?  It’s hard to be high.  Somebody said, “Oh, no, his polls are good.”  Give me a break.  (Laughter.)  Every city is being demolished.  They look like a demolition site, every single one of them.\nAnd the only thing he was really good at was playing Joe Biden like a fiddle.  He played him like a fiddle.  That’s an expression we use, Yasir, to say that he’s pretty easy.  Pretty easy.  (Laughter.)\nA dictator without elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he’s not going to have a country left.  Got to move.  Got to move fast, because that war is going in the wrong direction.\nIn the meantime, we’re successfully negotiating an end to the war with Russia — something all admit that only Trump is going to be able to do and the Trump administration.  We’re going to be able to do it.  I think Putin even admitted that.\nBiden never tried.  Europe has failed to bring peace.  And Zelenskyy probably wants to — maybe he wants to keep the gravy train going.  I don’t know what’s the problem, but he hasn’t been able to — he’s very upset that he wasn’t invited — he could have come if he wanted to — but that he wasn’t invited to Saudi Arabia.  But he’s been working for three years.  There’s never been even meetings or phone calls to stop this war.\nIt’s a horrible thing.  I figure Russia has lost 900,000 soldiers.  I think that Ukraine has lost probably 700,000, and it’s a terrible thing.  You’ll see body parts — bodies and body parts all over the field.  All over.  We see them through — very accurately through satellites.\nI love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job.  His country is shattered, and millions and millions of people have unnecessarily died.  And you can’t bring a war to an end if you don’t talk to both sides.  You got to talk.  They haven’t been talking for three years.\nSo, we hope to see a ceasefire soon and to reestablish stability in Europe and the Middle East.  (Applause.)\nBut as I — thank you very much.  And as I’ve said before, it’s my hope that my greatest legacy will be as a peacemaker and a unifier.  That would be a great legacy.  (Applause.)\nSo, in conclusion, the golden age of America is upon us, and I’m inviting everyone here today and every citizen across our land to take part in the most extraordinary period of peace, prosperity, growth, innovation, wealth creation, and expansion the world has ever seen.\nWe’re on our way.  I mean, everyone is talking about us.  Three weeks.  We’re in there for a couple of days more than three weeks, and everyone is talking about it.  You have to see the crowds of people outside.  It’s pretty amazing what’s happening.\nWe’re on the verge of soaring markets, surging incomes, booming production, groundbreaking technologies, thrilling discoveries, and a quantum leap in the quality of life.  Absolutely, a quantum leap.\nOne day very soon, our country will have the greatest economy in the history of the world, because we once again have a president who puts America first.  And we put America first, and your country should put your country first, but in the end, we want America first.  And when it’s all beautiful, which it’s going to be pretty soon, we want to help other countries and you want to help other countries.\nBut, you know, I tell your leaders — and some of the leaders are in this room right now — you got to put your country first.  Whether it’s Saudi Arabia, whether it’s something else, you’re going to put your country first, but we’re going to have plenty left over to help others also.\nAs long as you invest in America, build in America, and hire in America, that means that I’m fighting for you.  I am fighting very hard for you.\nTogether, we’re going to make the United States of America bigger, better, bolder, richer, and greater than ever before.  It’s going to be stronger than ever before.  We’re going to be a peacemaker and a peacekeeper.  We’re going to stop people from these stupid, never-ending wars.  We’re not going to partake in them ourselves, but we’ll be stronger and more powerful than anybody by far.  And if it ever came to war, there is nobody that will be able to come close to us, but we don’t think that’s going to ever happen.\nSo, I want to thank you all very much.  It’s a great honor to be here.\nAnd I think somebody said they’re going to ask questions, and I didn’t say, “Gee, what are the questions,” like Biden does.  I say, “Just ask.  It doesn’t matter.”  You ask a question, and I give an answer.\nSo, I think, Richard, you’re going to come up and you’re going to give me some questions.\nThank you very much.  (Applause.)\nMR. ATTIAS:  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Please, a round of applause for the president of United States of America.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nMR. ATTIAS:  Mr. President, thank you for accepting to take a few questions.  Twenty years ago, I don’t know if you will remember, we were under the same roof in Orlando, and you were delivering an amazing speech in front of 3,000 sales rep, giving them the best advice to be successful.  So, what is the best piece of advice that you have ever received?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think it was watching my father.  You know, my father was a very hard worker, and he just worked hard and he was very smart.  He had good genetics.  His brother was the longest-serving professor in the history of MIT, Dr. John Trump.  And my father was every bit as smart, but my father was — had to work.\nHe was older, and he put his brother through school.  In fact, he once said, “Boy, I put him through so much school.”  He had three different degrees, and they asked him to stay on at MIT.  But my father was the same ilk.\nAnd I noticed that my father was a happy man, and what he did is he worked.  He just worked all the time.  He worked, worked, worked, and he loved it.\nAnd, really, I think the best piece of advice I got from that is you have to love what you do, and if you love what you do, you’re going to have a happy life.  If you don’t — I mean, I see so many people, they’re in businesses that they don’t want to be in.  They’re in businesses that, you know, they’re bored in or they’re not good at, they don’t have a natural ability at it.  There is such a thing as natural ability, whether it’s sports or acting or anything else.  I mean, some people have an ability for something.  Try and find that ability.\nBut you have to love what you do.  If you love what you do, you’re going to be — at least you have a good chance of being successful.\nMR. ATTIAS:  Mr. President, it’s almost time for — (applause) — for an early dinner.  So, if you are throwing a dinner party, and you can invite three fascinating guests, living or dead, who would you bring?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, they’re all sitting right in the front row.  (Laughter and applause.)  Yasir, are you ready? Mohammed, are you ready?  Steve Witkoff.\nAnd we have Mr. — the most important person, at least until the World Cup is over, is here.  Gianni, stand up.  He gave the United States the World Cup.  (Applause.)  Gianni, thank you very mu- — I didn’t know you were here.  That’s very good.  He’s the king of soccer.  That’s not bad.  And you’ve done a fantastic job.\nYou know, but it’s very interesting, when I was president, I got the World Cup and I got all of the — you know, we have the 250 anniversary, so that fell in this administration.  That’s a big deal: 250 years.  But we have all of these things happening, and I also got the Olympics.\nAnd I was called by the mayor of Los Angeles, “Sir, would you call up the Olympic Committee because” — it was at that time — “President Obama will not take their phone call.  And we’re going to get the Olympics in Los Angeles.”\nAnd, by the way, they’ve recommitted to Los Angeles at a level that — you know, I was very worried about that.  And they’ve — the opposite.  You know, somebody could have said, “Well, we’re going to do it someplace else until” — they have actually recommitted.  They’re going to make it bigger and better than ever.  So, I want to let you know that.  (Applause.)\nBut I got — I had the Olympics.  So, I got the Olympics.  I got the World Cup, and I said — and the 250, but that one I didn’t get.  But it was there.  It was in this term.\nAnd I ran an election, and we did fantastic in 2016.  We did much better — millions and millions — tens of millions, but millions and millions of votes better.  And bad things happened, and I didn’t get that one.\nAnd I said, “You know” — when I originally signed the Olympics, I said, “I won’t be able to even be president, and I got the Olympics,” because if I didn’t — when I spoke with the people — the organizing committee and the people in different parts of the world — they asked me to do it because the president wouldn’t do it.  I was president-elect, and I gave them a talk.  I couldn’t get them off the phone.  They were starving for love.  And the bottom line: They gave us the Olympics.\nAnd I said, “You know, isn’t it sad I won’t be president?”  Then we had the election result, and now I’m president for the Olympics and for the World Cup.  (Applause.)  So, I’m very happy about that, Gianni.  Thank you very much.\nThank you, G- — (laughs) — I’ll be there.  I promise, I’ll be there.\nMR. ATTIAS:  And, by the way, Mr. President, backstage, you have a gift from Gianni.  He gave us the first ball with your name —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Ooh —\nMR. ATTIAS:  — which will be played for the cup — World Cup in America.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  It’s going to be great.  Thank you, Gianni, very much.  (Applause.)\nMR. ATTIAS:  I doubt that any day you will take a sabbatical year, but if you could take a sabbatical year, Mr.  President, what unconventional thing would you do?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  What was the word?\nMR. ATTIAS:  Sabbatical.  You don’t work for one year.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, sabbatical.  I thought — thought you said “sabbath.”  (Laughter.)  That’s a big difference.  It’s almost the opposite, when you think about it.  Right?  (Laughter.)\nI think what I’d do is — look, what I’m doing now is the most exciting job in the world.  It’s a hard job, not an easy job.  It’s a nasty job.  It could be a lot easier with — you know, I — I think that the — the news media has to straighten themselves out, because people are getting it.  You know, they — they’re losing tremendous popularity, and they’ve lost their prestige and they’ve lost their credibility.  And I think it’s a very important thing, the news media, but I think they have to straighten themselves out, because the people are going around them.\nNow, they have so many different things with — like Elon with X, which was a big — a big thing.  And we have Truth, which has been fantastic.  And we have so many other things that you don’t really need traditional.\nBut I — I will tell you that there is just nothing I could do to enjoy my life, whether it’s that or anything else that you’d ask, because this is the ultimate.  I mean, I had to make a big decision, and it was a very risky decision, because if I would have lost, my life would have been a much different life.  It would have been a very nasty life.  They were going after me at levels that nobody has ever seen before — not Andrew Jackson, not Abraham Lincoln.\nYou know, the historians say that the president that was treated the worst by far by the media and overall was Andrew Jackson.  In fact, his wife died of heartbreak.  They were treated really rough.  And Abraham Lincoln was second, but he had a civil war.  You know, you can understand that.\nBut nobody was treated like me.  Nobody.  And I will tell you, you learn a lot about yourself.  But there’s nothing I’d rather do.\nI had to make a decision: Do I do this?  Because if I lost, it would have been very, very bad.  It was dangerous, actually.  Very dangerous in so many different ways.\nAnd I decided to do it.  And I said, “I have to win, because if I don’t” — when I spoke to a friend of mine the other night, he said, “You know, if you lost, it would have been very” — it was actually Sean Hannity, just before we did the interview last night.  He said, “Boy, if you would have lost, it would have — you would have had a tough life.  You would have had a very tough life.”\nSo, it was — there was a certain amount of courage involved in this decision to run.  And it’s a great honor to win by this much — to win all seven swing states, the popular vote.\nPopular vote doesn’t get won that much by Republicans, for whatever reason.  I think that’s changing, because, again, we’re the party of common sense and they’re the party of some real bad things.\nAnd I think they’ll change.  I think they have to change.  It would be wonderful.  I’m going to be having lunch with some of the Democrats next week, and it would be wonderful if we could work together.  I think working together would be great.  But they have to change.  You can’t get elected on the programs that they want, and that’s one of — that’s really what America wants to see.\nSo, there’s nothing I’d rather do than what I’m doing right now.  (Applause.)\nMR. ATTIAS:  When we started this conference — Mr. President, when we started this conference, Yasir and I, His Royal Highness Crown Prince told us, “I want that to be the place where people will come to understand where to invest in terms of geographies and sector.”  So, what is the best investment you have made in your personal growth, Mr. President?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I was involved in real estate from, you know, most of my life and was — you know, guys like Witkoff will tell you I was really good at it and I was successful at it — very successful at it.  I’ve been involved in things prior to being president, but during the four years — during the last four years, you know, I followed sort of the trends, and I’ve made a lot of money with following some of these trends.\nAnd, you know, it’s — again, it’s something that you do.  You — it’s — I really believe that some people have instinct.  I think I’ve always had an instinct for making money.  I make money.\nAnd I went into show business.  I had one of the most successful shows on television.  I wrote books, and they were all bestsellers.  Virtually every book a bes- — was a big bestseller, some really big bestsellers.\nAnd so, I don’t know, it’s — whatever I do, I just want to make it successful.  It’s very important to me.\nThere are many ways to make money.  You can be in many different fields, and a lot of them is being in the right country.  You know, if you’re in a certain country — our country was actually getting very bad — a very dangerous place, actually.  Bad things were happening.  But if you’re in a certain country, you have a chance to do well.  And no matter how good you are, if you were born into the wrong country, you’re not going to make money.\nNow, you can do other things.  You can attain power, I guess.  Maybe it’s the wrong kind of power, but it’s power.  But being in the right country, where you have the right incentives and, you know, entrepreneurship, et cetera.\nAnd America has always been sort of at the top — or one of the top, but always pretty much at the top.  But it was losing that — it was losing that position and, I think, losing it rapidly.\nThis last administration — look, I don’t want to be — I wish I could say I — I wouldn’t have run if — if I thought Biden was doing a good job, if I thought they were — I wouldn’t have run, because, as I said, it was very dangerous to run in a lot of ways.  In fact, my ear will show that when you look at it closely.  My ear — I have that throbbing feeling every once in a while.  But it was dangerous in a lot of different ways.  But he was so bad that I had no choice but to do it.\nIf I thought he was doing a great job, I wouldn’t have run, and I would be very happy.  I actually wanted him to do a good job.  I was saying, “Do this.  Do that.”  I’m telling them do things.  They should have done what I said.  And — but I would have been — I would have been very happy not to have run and, frankly, to have seen somebody do a good job.  But our country was going to hell, and I really sort of had to run.\nMR. ATTIAS:  If you were a historical ruler, would you prefer to rule during war or peace?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I — I’d — I want to be, again, a peacemaker and I want to keep us out of war.  But sometimes, to do that, you have to have a very strong country.  You have to have a very strong military.  And as I said, we have a much stronger military than anyone would know.\nWe have the best equipment, and I bought a lot of it.  I rebuilt our military in the first four years.  I rebuilt it.  We gave a lot of it away to Afghanistan, to the Taliban, stupidly — but that’s a very small amount, relative.  It was billions and billions, but it’s still a very small amount relatively to what we built.  But I rebuilt — largely rebuilt our military.\nNow I’m going to have to do it again, because so much has been given away, so much has been treated so badly.\nAnd — but to keep peace, you really have to — I have a thing: strength through — and I mean it, you really have it.  You have strength, and you need the strength, but it’s really peace through strength, because without the strength, it’s going to be very hard to have peace because you’re going to be taken over, bad things are going to happen.  So, you really want to have peace through strength, and that’s where I’ve done it.\nHaving strength, having power, in that sense, to protect yourself and your people is a very important thing.  Hopefully, you don’t have to use that power.\nI will tell you, I was dealing with President Putin very successfully on denuclearization.  We were talking about it very seriously, and then COVID came and lots of things came.  And we had also talked to China about it.\nNow, Russia and us have the biggest nuclear by far.  China is not close, but they will be close.  In three or four years or five years, they’ll be equal.  But we were going to talk to China, and I spoke to President Xi about it very successfully.  I think we were going to denuclearize it.  We were — had to get the smaller nuclear powers, of which there are four — three, maybe, but four probably — to do something.  We would have been able to do that.  But I was having very strong talks with President Putin about denuclearization.\nAnd, you know, if you’re president, you get presentations about what we’re building; what we’re having; the power of weapons; the power of many things besides weapons, per se.\nWhen I saw the power of nuclear weapons — and we can never let that happen.  If that happens, the ball game will be — the world will be destroyed.  The power is so enormous.  You look at Hiroshima, you look at Nagasaki — multiply that times 500 times, and the world would be destroyed.\nSo, you want somebody as your president or you want somebody as your leader that understands that.  We just can’t let that happen.\nWe can’t let other countries get nuclear weapons — not only Iran.  Iran is a good example, and maybe the one that people think about, but we can’t let that happen.\nThe power of weaponry today is so enormous that the world — the world would disintegrate.  So, we can’t let it happen.\nMR. ATTIAS:  Mr. President, if you had to describe United States of America in just three words, what would they be?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  In three words?\nMR. ATTIAS:  Three words.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Love, respect, and strength.  (Applause.)\nThat’s a tough question.  That might be my best answer, Yasir.  That’s — that reminds me of high school, that one.  But that may have been the toughest question, actually.\nDo you think Joe Biden could have done that?  I don’t think so.  (Laughter.)  I don’t think so.\nMR. ATTIAS:  We’re almost at the end, Mr. President.  But talking about United States of America, what is one cultural habit in the Uni- — in the U.S. business that the rest of the world could learn from?  What is the best practice that (inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think we love our families, but I think a lot of the world loves their families, you know?\nI was speaking to the head of Mexico, because I complain constantly about people pouring in.  Now our border is the strongest border we’ve ever had.  We’ve gone from the worst border ever in history to the strongest border.  But I was speaking to the president of Mexico — a very wonderful woman, actually — and I said — we were talking about drugs — “You can’t let people come through your country and come into the country.”  You know, I was not that nice, but they understood what I was saying.\nAnd she said something that really got me.  She said — I said, “Are you a — you’re not a big drug-taking nation?”  And she said, “No, we are not a consumer.”  And I said, “A consumer.  What a — you know, an interesting word.  ‘We’re not a consumer nation.  We’re not a consumer of drugs.’”  I said, “What an interesting — and why — why is that?”  He said — she said, “Well, we have very strong family values.”  I said, “But we do too.  We do too.”  We have very strong — our families are devastated by what’s happening with fentanyl.\nAnd China will not be doing — we’re going to make a deal with China.  We’re not letting that happen anymore.  And I had a deal — by the way, before I left, I had a deal with President Xi where they were going to give the maximum penalty to anybody making fentanyl and sending it into the United States, and their maximum penalty is the death penalty.  And it would have stopped.  But when the election turned out to be a rigged election — but that’s okay — when election turned out to be — it was an election that shouldn’t have happened.\nAll the — all the things that happened — I give you an example: We wouldn’t have had October 7th Israel attack.  We wouldn’t have had Ukraine and Russia fighting.  We wouldn’t have had inflation.  We wouldn’t have had all of these things that, you know, happened.\nBut in speaking with her — she said about family values —  I said, “Well, you’re not really saying anything there, because we have great families too.  We have great family values.”  She said, “Plus, we advertise a lot.”  I said, “Ooh.  You mean you advertise about how bad drugs are?”  “Yes, we do.  We spend a lot of money on advertising.”  And I said, “Unbelievable.”\nThat was such a great conversation, because we’re going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars advertising how bad drugs are so that kids don’t use them — that they chew up your brain; they destroy your teeth, your skin, your everything.  (Applause.)\nAnd I thanked her for that.  You know, I — I make so many calls, and I never learn anything from anybody.  I know everything, and I never learned anything from anybody.  (Laughter.)  And I spoke to this woman — as soon as she said it — she didn’t have to say exactly what — I said, “Exactly.  What a great idea.”\nAnd I think we’re going to have a — and I saw pieces of it.  We’re going to go in with $100 million and then another $100 million initially.  But I saw some of the ads, and they are really violent.  I said, “You have to make them strong.”  Your skin practically comes off after a period of time.  You lose your hearing.  You — you lose your teeth.  You lose — I mean, you — it — it is terrible, and we show this happening to people.\nAnd I think we’re going to — you know, we — we did very well with — we had blue-ribbon committees, headed up by the first lady of the United States and a lot of other people that — you know, they have no idea the viciousness of these cartels and these people.  And they’re smarts.  I mean, they’re very smart, tough people — making a fortune, by the way — an absolute fortune.\nBut we got it down 18 percent, which was a record.  But 18 percent is not great, when you think about it.  I think we could get it down 50 or 55 or maybe even 60 percent with advertising.\nSo, she really gave me something.  I — I was going to call her and tell her that she did, but now I don’t have to call her because she’s going to be seeing this right now.  (Laughter.)\nSo, to the president of Mexico: Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.\nBut we’re going to do a great advertising campaign saying how bad it is, how drugs are so bad for you.  (Applause.)\nMR. ATTIAS:  My last question, Mr. President.  You have mentioned briefly in your speech about the legacy.  What would you like your legacy to be, if you can tell us more about it?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That I came into a country that was great but is in trouble, and I made America great again, and I got it out of trouble.  And people respect America now.  And we were a country of peace, and we brought peace to the rest of the world.  (Applause.)\nMR. ATTIAS:  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND                    6:54 P.M. EST\n"

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Hello.\nQ    Hello.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.\nSo, you just saw this.  (The president holds up a USA Today article entitled “How America voted, which counties shifted toward Trump and a look at voter turnout.”)  This just came out, and I’d say that’s quite good.  Right?  By any standard, that’s quite good.\nI shouldn’t leave USA — is anybody here from USA Today?\nQ    Yesterday, we had someone from —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yesterday.  We missed him.\nDoes everybody know Steven Cheung?  He’s a sweetheart.  You wouldn’t want to get in a fight with him, right?\nAnyway, what’s up?\nQ    Mr. President, the TikTok deal, any developments there?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, there’s a lot of people interested in TikTok, and I think we have a chance of doing something good.  And we’ll be speaking to China about that also, because they’re a party to it, obviously.  But it would be great to keep TikTok alive, sell it to somebody that’s going to do a great job with it.\nQ    Did you see the CEO today at the event, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Did I what?\nQ    Did you see the CEO today at the event?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I didn’t.  I didn’t speak to him.  Was he there?\nQ    He was supposed to be there.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think so, yeah, but I did not see him.\nQ    Sir, Elon Musk is proposing potentially giving money to Americans based on what DOGE is finding.  Do you have any thoughts on that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I love it.  A 20 percent dividend, so to speak, for the money that we’re saving by going after the waste and fraud and abuse and all of the other things that are happening.  I think it’s a great idea.\nQ    How much money do you think Americans —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It could be a lot.  I mean, if it’s 20 percent, we’d give back a lot of money to the taxpayer.  And also, it’d give an incentive for the taxpayer to go out and report things to us where we can save money.\nQ    So, you signed an immigration-related executive order today.  Ho- — what do you think of ICE arrests right now?  Do you think that they need to increase the number of people they’re arresting —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Where?\nQ    — increase the — the pace of the ICE arrests?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I think they’re doing a great job.  You know, you have people that are hiding.  They are professionals at hiding.  That’s what they’ve done for a big part of their lives.\nAnd they’re criminals.  In many cases, very serious criminals, including murderers.  And, obviously, they’re not easy to capture, but they’re being captured in record numbers, and they’re being brought out of our country, being brought back to where they came from.\nQ    Mr. President, on Boeing.  You mentioned maybe taking a different route.  What would a different route entail?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  On what?\nQ    On Boeing, with the Air Force One plane.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I’m not happy with Boeing.  It takes them a long time to do —\nYou know, Air Force One, we gave that contract out a long time ago.  It was a fixed-price contract, and I’m not happy with the fact that it’s taking so long.  And we may do something else.  We may go out and buy a plane or get a plane or something, but I’m not happy with the fact that it’s taken Boeing so long.  There no excuse for it.\n(Cross-talk.)\nAnd, you know, they had a fixed-price contract.  I made that deal, and now they — supposedly, they’re losing a lot of money and they’d like to see if they could, you know, up the price.  But I make fixed-price deals.  I don’t like time and material deals.\nQ    Sir, the only other commercial aircraft maker that could make a plane that big is Airbus.  Would you consider buying a —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I would not consider Airbus over Boeing, no.  But I could buy one that was used and convert it.  I could buy one from another country, perhaps, or get one from another country.\nSo, we’re looking at other alternatives, because it’s taking Boeing too long.\n(Cross-talk.)\nYou know, they were supposed to be finished, like, years ago.\nQ    Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Years ago.\nQ    Sir, and you —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Don’t forget, I signed that contract during my term, and it was a very good contract.  And I took, like, a billion six off the price, and it was supposed to be done, you know, quickly, and it’s a long time.  Right?\nQ    Would you push for your preferred color scheme for Air Force One?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, no, it’s going to be that color, yeah.  No matter what, it’s going to be for that color.\nQ    Sir, about Gaza.  Do you e- — do you find the Egyptian proposal to redevelop Gaza acceptable?  And does that change your —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t seen it.  I haven’t seen it.  When I see it, I’ll let you know.\nQ    Sir, can I you about Ukraine?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    You — you said today that you had a deal on critical minerals, and Ukraine broke it.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, we had a deal where we were going to get — look, you have to understand, Europe is being paid back the money that they put up, and they’re only putting up a fraction of what we’re putting up.  I think they’re in for $100 billion, and we’re in for $350 billion.  There’s no reason that should have happened.  It’s Biden’s fault.  He shouldn’t have allowed that to happen.\nBut on top of it all, they’re getting their $100 billion back, and we’re not.  And I’ve been talking about this for two years.  I said, “You have to loan them the money so that if things work out, they’re going to pay you back.”  And they didn’t do that.  So, Biden didn’t do it.  It’s his fault.  Nobody has ever seen anything so stupid.\nSo, Europe gets their money back, and they’re only in for a small fraction.  And, obviously, everything is important, but it’s more important for them because they’re right next to Russia.  So, it’s more important than — we have an ocean in between us.  So, it’s obviously more important to the European countries than it is to the U.S.\n(Cross-talk.)\nBut here’s the thing, we don’t get our money back.  And we told them that the deal is we’ll do something for the rare earth and some oil, et cetera, et cetera, and that would be all right.  And they agreed to it, more or less.\nAnd then Scott Bessent actually went there and was treated rather rudely, because — essentially, they told him no, and Zelenskyy was sleeping and unavailable to meet him.  He traveled many hours on the train, which is a dangerous trip.  And we’re talking about the secretary of the Treasury.  He went there to get a document signed.  And when he got there, he came back empty.  They wouldn’t sign the document.\nBut for Europe, they pay back their money.  It’s a loan.  Think of that.  And we should’ve had a loan, too, but we had an administration that was incompetent.\nQ    Can you resurrect that deal?  Is there anything that you can do?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I think I’m going to resurrect it, or, you know, we’ll see what happens.  But I’m going to resurrect it, or things are not going to make him too happy.\nAnd, look, it’s time for elections.  They haven’t had an election in a long time.  It’s wonderful to say, “You know, we can’t have an election.”  But it’s time for elections.\nAnd it’s also time to find out what happened with all the money, because he made the statement that half of it he doesn’t know where it is or something like that.  And I’d like to find out: All the money that we’ve been sending to Ukraine, where is it?\nAnd I can tell you we’re doing very well with Russia.  We’re going to do something with Russia that he was unable to do.  We can make a deal with Russia to stop the killing of, you know, potentially additional millions of people.  The soldiers are being just wiped out on both sides.  Wiped out.  It’s horrible.\nYou know, the weaponry today is so powerful, so, you know, strong that it’s killing a lot of soldiers.  And I don’t want to sol- — they’re Russian and they’re Ukrainian.  I don’t want to see those soldiers killed.  They have mothers and fathers.  They have sisters and brothers.  I don’t want to see them killed.\nQ    Mr. President, on tariffs, you mentioned lumber.  That’s something that I don’t believe we’ve heard before.  Any specific —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Lumber, yeah.  Forest — forest product, yeah.\nQ    And do you have a rate in mind for that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, but we’re thinking about maybe 25 percent.\nQ    And would that also be April 2nd?  On or before April 2nd?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  In that vicinity, yeah.  A little bit later.\nQ    And also, which car companies did you — you said that you spoke with some car companies.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I spoke to all car companies.  Everybody is coming back into America.\nQ    So, these are foreign car companies?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Including foreign companies, yeah.  They’re going to be coming in, because they don’t want to pay the tariffs.\nQ    You said you’ll be having lunch with some Democrats next week.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    Can you elaborate on who that is and what you all plan to discuss?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, you’ll see when I do it, but some good ones.\nQ    Are you —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Some biggies.\nQ    Are you con- — are you concerned about congressional funding?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I’m just —\nQ    Is that on the table?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think we’re going to just talk.\nI think it would be great if Republicans and Democrats could get along.  It’s time.  It’s time.  It makes sense.\nQ    Sir, would you say you trust the Russians to negotiate in good faith going forward?  Do you trust them?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I do.  I think the Russians want to see the war end.  And I do.  I really do.  But I think they have the cards a little bit, because, you know, they’re — they’ve taken a lot of territory, so they have the cards.\nQ    Mr. President, have you set a date for the British prime minister’s visit to Washington?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No.  He’ll be coming soon, though.  He has asked to come and see me.  So, he’ll be coming.\nQ    What about Macron?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And president of France also.  Macron will be coming.\nQ    But no set dates yet?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Very soon.  Maybe Monday.\nQ    Mr. President, on congestion pricing.  So — they’re going to be — it’s supposed to have saved about — or raised about $15 billion to help the MTA.  Do you have an alternative way that — to fund the MTA system now that there won’t be cong- —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, that’s up to New York.  They have to do that.\nLook, New York has treated a lot of people very badly.  And it’s hard to — you know, it’s hard to feel sorry for what’s happened in New York.  It’s sad to see the way they’ve treated people, and they continue to do it.\nAnd, you know, look at what’s going on with the mayor.  Look at what’s going on with so many other things.  So, congestion pricing is not a good situation, and they’re treating the people of New York very badly.\nThat’s a — supposing you worked in a shoe shop or you worked in a restaurant as a waiter, and you have to come into Manhattan, and they’re taking, you know, many, many dollars out of your pocket.  You can’t afford to do it.\nAnd price — you know, you — if you take a look, traffic will go down because people aren’t going to come.  If people don’t come, that means the whole place is — it’s going to be a disaster.\nSo, it could be, and it’s probably going to show that.  Traffic will come down, but that means they’re not going to spend their money in New York.  They’ll go someplace else.\nQ    (Inaudible) prepared to go to court if lawsuits ensue?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’ll see what happens.  You could give me the final, because I haven’t seen it as of late today because I was making a speech.\nDid I make a good speech?  Yes.\nOkay.  Go ahead.  What else?\nQ    Can I ask you about the Chinese?  So, you know, eventually, you would like to meet with President Xi.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    But we heard —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I have very good relationship with President Xi.  I think a great relationship with President Xi.  But remember, he loves China, and I love the USA.  So, you know, right there, there’s a little bit of competitiveness.  But the relationship I have with President Xi is, I would say, a great one.\nQ    We heard that you —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It was obviously hurt by COVID coming in.  It hurt them, hurt us, hurt everybody.  Hurt the whole world.  But outside of that, I have a very, very good relationship with President Xi.\nQ    Are you looking to make a new trade deal?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think he’s — I think he’s — I think he’s a very unique person.\nQ    Would you make a new trade deal with China?  I mean, you know, the —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, it’s possible.\nQ    One trade deal never really got —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s possible.\nWell, we did a great trade deal with China.  We did it — great for the farmers, great for manufacturers.  They had to buy 50 billion dollars’ worth of our product, and we were making them buy it.  The problem is that Biden didn’t push them to adhere to it.\nQ    Sir, do you think D.C. should govern itself, or do you think that governing of District of Columbia should go back to Congress?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think that we should govern District of Columbia.  It’s so important, the D.C. situation.  I think that we should run it strong, run it with law and order, make it absolutely flawlessly beautiful.\nAnd I think we should take over Washington, D.C.  Make it safe.  People are getting killed.  People are being hurt.  You have great police department there, but, somehow, they’re not utilized properly.\nWe should govern D.C.  I think the federal government should take over the governance of D.C. and run it really, really properly.\nAnd I like the mayor.  I get along great with the mayor, but they’re not doing the job.  Too much crime.  Too much graffiti.  Too many tents on the lawns of these magnificent lawns, and there’s tents.  And, you know, it’s a — it’s a sad thing.  You know, homeless people all over the place, and we got to take care of the homeless.  But you can’t have that in Washington, D.C.\nYou know, when they come over to see me — like Macron is coming and the prime minister of UK is coming and all these people are coming over to see me — we’ll have, ultimately, President Xi, and we’ll have everybody coming, right?  And you can’t let that be.  You just can’t let that happen.  You can’t have tents all over your beautiful — your once magnificent plazas and lawns and all of it.  You just can’t do it.\n(Cross-talk.)\nMR. CHEUNG:  We’ll do — we’ll do a couple more.\nQ    Sir, do you think you can still pay for extending your tax cuts without cutting both Medicaid and Medicare?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, absolutely.\nQ    House Republicans are planning to make cuts to Med- —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think we’re going to take in tremendous tariff money, number one.  And number two, you take a look at DOGE, and you see what’s happening.  We’re saving billions of dollars.\nQ    On DOGE.  Do you know what they’re looking at, specifically, at the Department of Defense right now?  And —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, they’re looking at everything.\nQ    And are they going to cut more national security —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They’re looking — and we’re going to go into Fort Knox to make sure the gold is there.\nQ    Are they going to cut more —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Do you know that?  We’re going to go into Fort Knox.  Do you know about that?\nQ    Sir — sir —\n(Air Force One experiences turbulence.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That was a bad bump.\nQ    Are they going to eliminate more national security positions, civilians there at DOD?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’ll see what happens.\nBut one of the things — we do want to look.  I mean, we hope everything’s fine with Fort Knox, but we’re going to go to Fort Knox — the fabled Fort Knox — to make sure the gold is there.\nQ    Where would the gold have gone?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  If the gold isn’t there, we’re going to be very upset.\nQ    Can you bring us along?\nQ    You haven’t brought up Greenland in a — in a while.  Are you seeing —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no, very — we need Greenland from the standpoint of national security and international security.  We have to do something with Greenland.  We have to protect Greenland.  But we need it for national security, and we need it, maybe more importantly, for international security.\n(Cross-talk.)\nMR. CHEUNG:  All right, we’ll just do one more.  One more.\nQ    Can I just follow up?  Are you seeing it as part of any of the discussions you’re having with Europeans and Putin in some sort of peace deal?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  We have to have Greenland because of the national security picture, even more so now than it would have been 20 years ago, 30 years ago, when they talked about it then too.\nYou know, they used to talk about it.  Years ago, they were talking about Greenland, but much more so now with, you know, modern weaponry, planes and the speed of planes, and all of the things.  So, we have to have Greenland.\nThank you very much.\nEND                  9:14 P.M.

EST\nQ    Mr. President, great to see you again.     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.     Q    How are you?     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.      Q    Elon Musk.     MR. MUSK:  Hi.     Q    Great to see you.      MR. MUSK:  Thanks.  Thanks for having me.     Q    I’ve been reading a lot about you.  I’ve got to start with this.  So, he’s working for free with DOGE.  He’s — he’s kind of put a lot of his life on hold, and you sued Twitter a number of years ago.  You just made him pay you $10 million?     THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  That’s right.     Q    That’s — that’s right.  (Laughs.)     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I sued — I sued from long before he had it.      MR. MUSK:  Yeah.  Yeah.  (Inaudible.)     THE PRESIDENT:  And, I mean, they really did a number on me, you know.  And I sued, and they had to pay.  You know, they paid $10 million settlement.     Q    You’re okay with that?         MR. MUSK:  I mean, I left it up to the lawyers and, you know, the team running Twitter.  So, I said, “You guys do what you think is the right — makes sense.”     Q    I think it’s funny.     THE PRESIDENT:  I think —     Q    Because —     THE PRESIDENT:  — it’s a very low — I was looking to get much more money than that.         Q    So, you gave him a discount w- — in the lawsuit?     THE PRESIDENT:  He got — oh, he got a big discount.  I don’t think he even knows about it.     Q    He’s become one of your — if you read and believe the media — he’s become one of your best friends.  He’s working for free for you.  He’s —     MR. MUSK:  Well, I love the president.  I just want to be clear about that.       Q    You don’t care about that?      MR. MUSK:  I — no, I love the pr- — I —     Q    You love the president?      MR. MUSK:  I think — I think President Trump is a good man, and — and he’s, you know — I — I —     THE PRESIDENT:  That’s the way he said that.  You know, there’s something nice about.  (Laughter.)     MR. MUSK:  No, it is.  I, you know —     THE PRESIDENT:  It is.     MR. MUSK:  Because, I mean, the president has been so — so unfairly attacked in the media.  It’s truly outrageous.  And I’ve sp- — at this point, spent a lot of time with the president, and not once have I seen him do something that was mean or cruel or — or wrong.  Not once.      Q    You know, I’ve known him for 30 years.     MR. MUSK:  Yeah.     Q    And I’ve never seen anybody take as much as he’s taken.     MR. MUSK:  Yeah.     Q    And we’ve discussed this.  And I’m like, “How do you deal with it?”     THE PRESIDENT:  Did have a choice?  (Laughs.)  I didn’t have a choice.     Q    Well, you would say that to me.  I’m like, “What — what am I going to do?  Worry about it?”     THE PRESIDENT:  That’s the only thing I can say.     Q    And, you know — and then culminating in two assassination attempts, which resulted in your endorsement.      MR. MUSK:  Well, I was going to do it anyway, but that was —     Q    That was it?     MR. MUSK:  — a precipitating event, yeah.     THE PRESIDENT:  That speeded it up a little bit?     MR. MUSK:  Yeah.  Yeah.     Q    The day of the assassination?      THE PRESIDENT:  Nice.  I didn’t know that.      MR. MUSK:  Yeah, it just — it sped it up, but I was going to do it anyway.     Q    Mr. President, with your indulgence, I’m convinced that people only know a little bit about Elon.  I don’t think they know everything about Elon, because as I studied for and prepared for this interview, I learned a lot about you that I didn’t know.  I think people will think about Tesla.  Democrats are demonizing you and — and trying to make the country hate you.      I just want people to understand you a little bit better, and the person that you’ve gotten to know and have now put a lot of trust in.      THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.     Q    And, you know, just — let’s go over a little bit of your bio, starting —     MR. MUSK:  Ah, okay.     Q    — with PayPal and how you became involved in Tesla and SpaceX and Neuralink —     MR. MUSK:  This — this could take a while.     Q    — and all these —     MR. MUSK:  I mean, you know, I — I think the way you think of me is, like, I’m a technologist and I try to make technologies that improve the world and make life better.     Q    You can show them your shirt.     MR. MUSK:  Yeah, and that’s why, like, my t-shirt says “tech support” — (laughter) — because I’m here to provide the president with — with technology support.      And now, that — that may seem, like, well, is that a silly thing?  But actually, it’s a very important thing, because the president will make these executive orders, which are very sensible and good for the country, but then they don’t get implemented, you know?     So, if you take the — for example, all the funding for the migrant hotels, the president issued an executive order: Hey, we need to stop taking taxpayer money and — and paying for luxury hotels for illegal immigrants —     Q    It’s crazy.     MR. MUSK:  — which makes no sense.  Like, obviously, people do not want their tax dollars going to — to fund high-end hotels for — for illegals.  And yet, they were still doing that, even as late as last week.      And so, you know, we went in there, and we were like, “This is in violation of the presidential executive order.  It needs to stop.”      So — so, what we’re — what we’re doing here is — is — one of the biggest functions of the DOGE team is just making sure that the presidential executive orders are actually carried out.  And this is — I just want to point out, this is a very important thing, because the president is the elected representative of the people, so he’s representing the will of the people.  And if the bureaucracy is fighting the will of the people and preventing the pres- — the president from implementing what the people want, then what we live in is a bureaucracy and not a democracy.\nQ    Yeah.  You — you’re both aware — you have to be keenly aware that the media and — and the punditry class — not that — you know, I think you’ve proven they have no power anymore, because they threw everything they had at you, and they didn’t win.  And that was, you know, the New York Times, Washington Post, three networks, every late-night comedy show, two cable channels — they — they just threw — they threw everything — lawfare, weaponization.      THE PRESIDENT:  It’s true.     Q    And now I see they want you two to start — they want a divorce.  They want you two to start hating each other.  And they try — “Oh, President Elon Musk,” for example.  You do know that they’re doing that to you?     THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I see it all the time.  They tried it, then they stopped.  That wasn’t — they have many different things of hatred.      Actually, Elon called me.  He said, “You know they’re trying to drive us apart.”  I said, “Absolutely.”      You know, they said, “We have breaking news: Donald Trump has ceded control of the presidency to Elon Musk.  President Musk will be attending a Cabinet meeting tonight at 8 o’clock.”  (Laughter.)  And I say — it’s just so obvious.  They’re so bad at it.      I used to think they were good at it.  They’re actually bad at it, because if they were good at it, I’d never be president because I — I think nobody in history has ever gotten more bad publicity than me.      I could do the greatest things; I get 98 percent bad publicity.  I could do — outside of you and a few of your very good friends.  It’s, like, the craziest thing.      But you know what I have learned, Elon?  The people are smart.  They get it.      MR. MUSK.  Yeah.  They do, actually.  Yeah.     THE PRESIDENT:  They get it.  They really see what’s happening.      MR. MUSK:  Yes.     Q    And at the end of this interview, I — what I would like is, I — I want people to know the relationship and know more about you.      What is the relationship, Mr. President?     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I respect him.  I’ve always respected him.  I never knew that he was right on certain things, and I’m usually pretty good at this stuff.  He did Starlink.  He did things that were so advanced and nobody knew what the hell they were.      I can tell you, in North Carolina, they had no communication.  They were wiped out.  Those people were — you know, they had rivers in between — land that never saw water, all of a sudden, there was a river and a vicious — like, rapids.  People were dying all over.  They had no communication.      They said, “Do you know Elon Musk?”   And they didn’t really know I knew him.  I said, “Yeah.”  They said, “Could you get Starlink?”  It’s, like, the first time I ever heard of it.  I said, “What’s Starlink?”  “A communication system that’s unbelievable.”      Q    I have it.     THE PRESIDENT:  And he — yeah.  And he said — I called him, and I said, “Listen, they really need it.”  And he got, like, thousands of units of this communication, and it saved a lot of lives.  He got it immediately.  And you can’t get it.  I mean, you have to wait a long time to get it.  But he got it to him immediately.      And I said, “That’s pretty amazing.”  And I didn’t even know he had it.      We watch the rocket ships, and we watch Tesla.     I think, you know, something that had an effect on me was when I saw the rocket ship come back and get grabbed like you grab a beautiful little baby.  You grab your baby.  It just —     MR. MUSK:  Just hug the rocket.      THE PRESIDENT:  I’d never seen —     MR. MUSK:  Everyone — right.  Everyone needs (inaudible) —     Q    You hug the rocket.  You hug the rocket.     MR. MUSK:  — (inaudible) rockets.      THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  No, but — and he said, “You know, you can’t really have a rocket program if you’re going to dump a billion dollars into the ocean every time you fly.  You have to save it.”  And he saved it.  First time —     Q    That’s ever been done.         THE PRESIDENT:  — I’ve ever seen that done.  Now nobody else can do it.      If you look at the U.S., Russia, or China, they can’t do it, and they won’t be able to do it for a long time.  He has the technology.  So, you learn — I wanted somebody really smart to work with me, in terms of the country — a very important aspect.  Because, I mean, he doesn’t talk about it.  He’s actually a very good businessman.  And when he talks about the executive orders — and this is probably true for all presidents: You write an executive order and you think it’s done, you send it out; it doesn’t get done.  It doesn’t get implemented.  They don’t implement it.      They — maybe they’re from the last administration — and they are, in some cases.  You try and get them out as fast as you can.  But I could — as soon as he said that, I said, “You know, that’s interesting.”  You write a beautiful executive — and you sign it and you assume it’s going to be done, but it’s not.  What he does is he takes it, and with his hundred geniuses — he’s got some very brilliant young people working for him that dress much worse than him, actually —     MR. MUSK:  Yeah, they do.     THE PRESIDENT:  — they dress in just t-shirts.  (Laughter.)  You wouldn’t know they have 180 IQ.     Q    Wait.  Wait.  So, what — he’s — he’s your tech support?     MR. MUSK:  I —     THE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  He is —     MR. MUSK:  I actually virtually am tech support.     THE PRESIDENT:  He’s much more than that.     MR. MUSK:  I actually am tech support, though.  But that’s —     THE PRESIDENT:  But he gets it done.  He’s a leader.  He really is a — he gets it done.  You get a lot of tech people, and you have people, they’re good with tech, but they — he gets it done.      You know, I said, in real estate, you had guys that would draw beautiful renderings of a building, and they’d draw the rendering, it would be great, and you’d say, “Great.  When are you starting?”  But they were never able to get it built.  They couldn’t get the finances.  They couldn’t get the approvals.  It would never get done.  And then you have other guys that are able to get it done.  You know, they could just get it done.      I was in real estate.  Same thing in this.  He gets it done.      So, when he said that — he said, “You know, when you sign these executive orders, a lot of them don’t get done, and maybe the most important ones,” and he would take that executive order that I’d signed, and he would have those people go to whatever agency it was — “When are you doing it?  Get it done.  Get it done.”  And some guy that maybe didn’t want to do it, all of a sudden, he’s signing — he just doesn’t want to bothered.     Q    Does — do a lot of those executive orders have to be codified into law to — do you need the Republican Congress to follow up?     THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, and they will.  A lot of them will be.  Yeah.     Q    They will?     THE PRESIDENT:  Look, in the meantime, we have four years.  The beauty is, we have four years.  That’s why I like doing it right at the beginning.  Because an executive order is great.  I mean, the one problem — it’s both good and bad, because when they did all these executive orders, I’ve canceled most of them.  They were terrible.  I mean, we were going to go radical left, communist, okay?  It was crazy.  Their —     MR. MUSK:  Really crazy.     THE PRESIDENT:  — executive orders were so bad, if they ever got them codified, you’d never be able to break them.  So, the damage that Biden has done to this country — and it’s not even Biden; it’s the people that circled him in the Oval Office, okay? — but the damage they did to this country, in terms of, let’s say, open borders — you know, there’s so many things, but open borders, where millions of people poured into our country, and hundreds of thousands of those people are criminals.  They’re murderers.  They’re drug dealers.  They’re gang members.  They’re people from prisons from all over the world.      And we have a great guy, Tom Homan, and he is doing so incredibly.  You saw the numbers.  They’re down like 96 percent.     Q    Ninety-five percent.     THE PRESIDENT:  He is a phenomenal guy.  And Kristi Noem is doing an unbelievable job.  And he wanted her.  He said, “She’s so tough.”  And I said, “I don’t think of her as that way.  You know, she’s very nice.”  He said, “No, she’s so tough.”  And she is.  I see her with the horses.  She’s riding the horse.  Let’s — (laughter) — she’s great.      But the team we have is — is really unbelievable.      But those executive orders, I sign them, and now they get passed on to him and his group and other people, and they’re all getting done.  We’re getting them done.\nQ    Let me go back a little bit to your background, because —     MR. MUSK:  Sure.     Q    — it’s beyond impressive.  You were the chief engineer, for example — you were an early believer in Tesla.  You became the CEO and — and then the chief engineer, which was phenomenal.  SpaceX, same thing, which is unbelievable.      I mean, you were the first company — private company to send astronauts successfully into — into space, first private company to send astronauts into orbit.      MR. MUSK:  Yeah.     Q    That’s — that’s pretty deep.      THE PRESIDENT:  He’s going to go into orbit soon.     Q    Okay.     MR. MUSK:  (Laughs.)  Yeah.     THE PRESIDENT:  No, he’s going to go to Mars.  He’s going to fly on his —     Q    Starlink.     MR. MUSK:  At some point, yeah.     Q    As in (inaudible) —     MR. MUSK:  But they say — they always ask me, like, “Do you want to die on Mars?”  And I say, “Well, yes, but not on impact.”  (Laughter.)     Q    Star- — Starlink is in 100 countries.      This is going to be hard.  I feel like I’m interviewing two brothers here.     MR. MUSK:  You go ahead.      Q    Starshield, which could be used for national defense.      MR. MUSK:  Yeah, it is already being used for national defense.      Q    Then you have a — what is it called?  Optimus, a part of Tesla.     MR. MUSK:  They’re a robot, yeah.     Q    A robotic arm.  Then you have an AI arm.  And then you have something that really fascinated me, and it’s called Neuralink.      MR. MUSK:  Yes.     Q    You might help the blind to see and people with spinal cord injuries that they — that they can recover, where in the past — how close is that to becoming a success?     MR. MUSK:  At Neuralink we’re — we’ve ha- — we’ve implanted Neuralink in three patients so far, who are quadriplegics, and it allows them to directly control their phone and computer just using their mind, just by thinking.  It’s like — so, we call this product Telepathy, so you control your computer and phone just by thinking, and it’s possible to actually control the computer and phone faster than someone who has working hands.     Then the next step would be to add a second Neuralink implant past the point where these — the neurons are damaged, so that somebody can walk again and so the pe- — they can have full-body functionality restored.  And —     THE PRESIDENT:  And you like Bobby, right?     MR. MUSK:  I like Bobby, actually.  Yeah.  I — I supported Bobby Kennedy.  I think he — you know, he’s unfairly maligned as someone who is anti-science.  But I think he — he isn’t.  He just wants to question the science, which is the essence of the science — the scientific method, fundamentally, is about always questioning the science.      Q    Well, they didn’t tell us the truth about COVID.     MR. MUSK:  Correct.     Q    That’s for sure.      MR. MUSK:  Yes.      Q    And we learned a lot with the Twitter files.  And that just, then, raises a question.  You’re the richest man in the world.  You may not like that part.      THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.     Q    You’re pretty competitive.     MR. MUSK:  I mean, it’s neither here nor there.     Q    I’ve known you a long time.     MR. MUSK:  I don’t think it matters.     Q    But —     THE PRESIDENT:  That’s why I became president.     Q    — he’s on your team.     THE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible) —     Q    Well, that’s true.  He can’t top that.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s good.  You know, I wanted to find somebody smarter than him.  I searched all over.  I just couldn’t do it.  I couldn’t.  I couldn’t.         Q    You really tried hard.     THE PRESIDENT:  I couldn’t find anyone smarter, right?  So, we had to — we had to, for the country.     Q    But this is the thing —     THE PRESIDENT:  So, we settled on — we settled on this guy.     MR. MUSK:  Well, thanks for having me.     THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  Yeah.     Q    So —     MR. MUSK:  I’m just trying to be useful here.     Q    But this is the interesting — but this is where we are as a so- — a society.  And I — I hate to do this to you, but I’m going to do it anyway.  You’re doing all of these things.  At DOGE, nobody at DOGE gets paid a penny, correct?     MR. MUSK:  Well, actually, some people are federal employees, so they do.      Q    Oh, okay.     MR. MUSK:  Yeah.  They’re (inaudible).  But it’s fair to say that the software engineers at DOGE could be earning millions of dollars a year and instead of earning a small fraction of that as federal employees.\nQ    Okay.  So, just —     THE PRESIDENT:  And they’re very committed people.      MR. MUSK:  Yes.     Q    So — you’re — you’re committed to helping the blind see, people with spinal cord injuries recover.      MR. MUSK:  Yes.     Q    You’re committed to getting to Mars.  You’re committed to rescue — you’re going to help rescue, next month, two astronauts that I think were abandoned.  They — they dispute that in an interview.     THE PRESIDENT:  When are you — when are you getting them?     MR. MUSK:  At the — at the president’s request, we — or instruction, we are accelerating the return of the astronauts, which was postponed, kind of, to a ridiculous degree.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They got left in space.      Q    They’ve been there.  They were supposed to be there eight days.  They’re there almost 300.     THE PRESIDENT:  Biden.      MR. MUSK:  They were put —     Q    Yeah.     MR. MUSK:  Yes, they were left up there for political reasons, which is not good.      Q    Okay, it’s not good.  Now, if I had the weight and pressure of doing that successfully on my shoulders, I think I’d be, you know — but you — when we spoke before we did this interview, you were very confident.  You think this will be a successful mission.      MR. MUSK:  Well, we don’t want to be complacent, but we have brought astronauts back from the space station many times before, and always with success.  So, as long as we’re not complacent —     THE PRESIDENT:  When are they — when are you going to launch?     MR. MUSK:  I think it’s about — about four weeks to\nbring them back.      Q    About four weeks?      MR. MUSK:  Yeah.      THE PRESIDENT:  And you have the go-ahead.     MR. MUSK:  We’re being extremely cautious.\nQ    Yeah.     THE PRESIDENT:  You now have the go-ahead.     MR. MUSK:  Yes.  Well, thanks to you —     THE PRESIDENT:  They didn’t have the go-ahead with Biden.      Q    What’s that?     THE PRESIDENT:  He was going to leave him in space.  I think he was going to leave them in space.     Q    Well, it’s like the (inaudible) —     THE PRESIDENT:  He considered it a —     Q    — growing up, lost in space.      THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, he didn’t want the publicity.  Can you believe it?     Q    Unbelievable.  And so —     MR. MUSK:  Yeah.     Q    — I want to echo something that the president said and then ask an overarching question.  So, people in — get hit with Hurricane Helene, they have no communication with the outside world.  You come to the rescue.  You donated that, I believe?     MR. MUSK:  Yes.  Yes.     Q    You donated to the people of —     THE PRESIDENT:  He saved a lot of lives.  In North Carolina, he saved a lot of lives.      Q    And California, after the wildfires?     THE PRESIDENT:  California.  But, I mean, in North Carolina, where they were really in trouble, they had no communication, people were dying.     Q    Nothing.     THE PRESIDENT:  They were dying of starvation.  He saved a lot of lives in North Carolina.\nQ    Okay.  Now you’re going to rescue astronauts.  And now — again, you do — you do all of this — I would think liberals would love the fact that you have the biggest electric vehicle company in the world.      MR. MUSK:  Yeah.  I mean, I used to be adored by the left, you know.     Q    Not anymore.     MR. MUSK:  Le- — less so these days.     Q    He killed that, huh?     MR. MUSK:  I mean, less —     THE PRESIDENT:  I really (inaudible) —     MR. MUSK:  Well, I mean, this — this whole sort of, like, you know — it was — they call it, like, “Trump derangement syndrome.”  And I didn’t — you know, you don’t realize how real this is until, like, it’s — you can’t reason with people.      So, like, I was at a friend’s birthday party in L.A., just a birthday dinner, and it was, like, a nice, quiet dinner, and everything was — everyone was behaving normally.  And then I happened to mention — this was before the election, like a month or two before — I happened to mention the president’s name, and it was like they got shot with a dart in the jugular that contained, like, the methamphetamine and rabies.  Okay?  (Laughter.)     And they’re like, “Whyy?”  And I’m, like, “What is wrong — like, guys, like” — you just can’t have, like, a normal conversation.  And it’s like — it’s like they become completely irrational.      Q    He — he has no idea, if you’re friends with him —     MR. MUSK:  Yeah.     Q    — you pay a price.  You know, it’s like, I walk into a restaurant in New York, and it’s like half the room gets daggers and they want to —     MR. MUSK:  The eye-daggers — eye-daggers level is insane.  (Laughter.)     I mean, there was, like — I had, like, some — some invitation because — so, I got invited to, like, so- — basically, a big, sort of, damn — damn event like that was — but I’d received the invitation, like, the beginning of last year and then — and I still attended, even after I’d endorsed President Trump, and I didn’t realize how profoundly that would affect, you know, how I was received.  (Laughter.)     I mean, I walk into the room and I’m getting just the dirty looks from — from everyone.  Like, if looks could kill, I would have been dead several times over.     Q    But that was not — (laughter) — before Trump     MR. MUSK:  (Inaudible) —     Q    Before Trump: “BC” —     MR. MUSK:  — ashes on the floor.  (Laughs.)     Q    — or “BT.”  Before Trump, that never happened.  Right?     MR. MUSK:  No.     Q    No.  So —\nMR. MUSK:  I — I just — doesn’t seem strange?  Like, what — what is up with this total, like, madness?     Q    You’re smarter than me.  Can you — I actually think that there’s a level of irrationality.  It’s almost like a trigger and —     MR. MUSK:  It totally triggers.      Q    And it’s like — look, I — I’ve been on TV — this is my 29th year.  I’ve been on radio 35 years.  I will — I’ve gone hard in the paint to — for candidates that lost.     MR. MUSK:  Yeah.     Q    And guess what?  I get over it.     MR. MUSK.  Sure.  Yeah, yeah.     Q    And I just keep doing my show, and I just — you know, I come back to fight another day.     So, here’s the big — then this is the million dollar or billion dollar — I’m among billionaires — question.  So, you have all this going on and you stop, in a way — you’re still doing it — and you partner with him.  And this is what you get for it from the Democrats.  You get “nobody voted for Elon.”  Well, nobody voted for any of your Cabinet nominees.  Okay?  “People are dying because of DOGE cuts.”  I’ll give you a chance to respond to all that.  “What DOGE is doing is illegal.”  “Elon Musk is” — more street vernacular for a male body part.  “It’s a constitutional crisis.”     MR. MUSK:  How c- — why — why are they reacting like this?     Q    Well, first of all, do you give a flying rip?  Number one.  And —     MR. MUSK:  Well, I guess we must be — if we’re the target, we’re doing something right.  You know, if — like, they wouldn’t be complaining so much if they — we weren’t doing something useful, I think.      What — all we’re really trying to do here is restore the will of the people through the president.  And — and what we’re finding is there’s an unelected bureaucracy.  Speaking of unelected, there’s a — there’s a vast federal bureaucracy that is implacably opposed to the — the president and the Cabinet.      And you look at, say, D.C. voting.  It’s 92 percent Kamala.  Okay, so we’re in 92 percent Kamala.  That’s a lot.      Q    Yeah.  They don’t like me here either.      MR. MUSK:  I think about that number a lot.  I’m like, 92 percent.  That’s, basically, almost everyone.  And so — but if — but how can you — if — if the will of the president is not implemented, and the president is representative of the people, that means the will of the people is not being implemented, and that means we don’t live in a democracy, we live in a bureaucracy.      And so, I think what we’re seeing here is the — sort of, the thrashing of the bureaucracy as we try to restore democracy and the will of the people.     Q    You —     MR. MUSK:  Is this making sense?  I mean — sorry.     Q    Y- — no, of course it does.  I mean, to me, if you look at our framers and our founders — and you’ve really become a student of history, Mr. President, and we’ve ta- — we’ve had conversations both on air and off air — and if we talk about constitutional order or transformational change, nobody can argue that what’s happening here is going at the speed of light.      But however, what were the principles of our framers and our founders?  They wanted limited government, greater freedom for the people — and we’ll get to the specific cutting of waste, fraud, and abuse.  That — that is your goal, is it not?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  And my goal was to get great people.  And when you look at what this man has done, I mean, it was something — I knew him a little bit through the White House. Originally, I’d see him around a little bit.  I didn’t know him before that, and I respected what he did.  And he fought hard.  You know, he was a — he was maybe questioned for a while.  He was having some difficulties.  It was not easy doing what he did.\nI mean, how many people have started a car company and made it really successful and made a better car where it’s, you know, beating these big companies that that’s all they do is cars?  I mean, it’s really amazing the things that he’s done.\nBut I didn’t know it as much then as now.  I mean, the fruits have sort of taken hold.\nBut I wanted great people, and he’s a great person.  He’s an amazing person.  He’s also a caring person.  You know, he uses the word “care.”\nSo, they sign a contract in a government agency, and it has three months.  And the guy leaves that signed the contract, and nobody else is there, and they pay the contract for 10 years.\nSo, the guy is getting checks for years and years and years, and he’s telling his family, obviously — maybe it was crooked, maybe he paid to get the contract, or maybe he paid that they didn’t terminate him.  But, you know, we have contracts that go forever, and they’ve been going for years, and they’re supposed to end in three months or five months or two years or something, and they go forever.  So, the guy is either crooked — you know, where he knew this was going to happen — or he’s crooked because he’s getting payments that he knows he shouldn’t be getting.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But they’re finding things like that.  They’re finding things far worse than that.  And they’re finding billions — and it will be hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of fraud.  I say waste and abuse, but fraud, waste, and abuse.  And he’s doing an amazing job.\nAnd he attracts a young, very smart type of person.  I call them high-IQ individuals, and they are.  They’re very high Q and — high IQ.  And when they go in to see the people and talk to these people — you know, the people think they’re going to pull it over.  They don’t.  These guys are smart, and they love the country.  You know, there’s a certain something.      But he uses the word “care.”  So, people have to care.  Like, when I bought Air Force One —\nMR. MUSK:  Exactly.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — I negotiated the price.  It was $5.7 billion, and I got it — I got them down $1.7 billion.  Now they’re not building the plane fast enough.  I mean, they’re actually in default — Boeing.  They’re supposed to —\nQ    When is it —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They’ve been building this thing forever.  I don’t know —\nQ    This is the new Air Force One?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — what’s going on.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We don’t build the way we used to build.  You know, we used to build like a ship a day, and now to build a ship is, like, a big deal, and we’re going to get this country back on track.  We could do it, but so many things — it takes so long to get things built and get things done.\nAnd a lot of it could be something we’ve been discussing.  The regulators go in and they make it impossible to build.  They make it very difficult to build anything, whether it’s a ship, a plane, or a building or anything.  And some of them do it because they want to show how important they are.  Some of them do it maybe because they think they’re right.  They use the environment to stop progress and to stop things.  It’s always the environment.  “It’s an environmental problem.”  It’s not an environmental problem at all.  But they do a lot of things.\nAnd, by the way, speaking of that, Lee Zeldin is going to be fantastic in the position.  So important.  He could take 10 years to approve or disapprove something, or he could do it in a month.  You know, just as good.\nQ    Sure.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And I think you’re going to see some fantastic — a fantastic job done by him.  He’s a tremendous guy.\nQ    Newt — you echoed something when I had just met you, and it was very similar to what Newt has been saying, that we’re — he brought this country to the dance.  This is the opportunity to be transformational, and to have, I would argue, a — the most consequential presidency if we — if we’d really dig down and do something that had never been done before, and that is get rid of this bureaucracy.  And I’m going —\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nQ    — to get to specifics.  You say the same thing.  It’s not done yet.\nMR. MUSK:  Absolutely.\nQ    And what did you mean by that?\nMR. MUSK:  Well, I mean the — w- — winning the election is really the opportunity to fix the system.  It is not fixing the system itself.  So, it’s an opportunity to fix the system and to restore the power of democracy.\nAnd, you know, people — like, it’s funny how — how often it — you — when these attacks occur, the thing that they’re accusing the administration of is what they are guilty of.  They’re saying that things are — are being done are unconstitutional, but what they are doing is unconstitutional.  They are guilty of the crime of which they accuse us.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s always the first thing they do.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  “He’s in violation of the Constitution.”  They don’t even know what they’re talking — well, they know.\nMR. MUSK:  It’s absurd.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s just a con job.  It’s a big con job.  And they’re so bad for the country, so dangerous and so bad.\nAnd the media is so bad.  When I watch MSNBC, which I don’t watch much, but you have to watch the enemy on occasion, the level of arrogance and — and cheating and — they’re just horrible people.  These are horrible people.\nQ    They lie.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  These are horrible people.\nQ    They tell conspiracy theories.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They lie, and they start up with the Constitution.  They couldn’t care less about the Constitution.\nCNN, likewise.  I mean, I watched them asking questions with, you know, the hatred with the — why — I said, “What are you asking the question with such anger?  You’re asking me a normal question.”  But you see the bias.  The bias is so incredible.  Those two are bad.\nPBS is bad.  AP is bad.  CBS is terrible.\nI mean, CBS now — they changed an answer in Kamala.  They asked her some questions.  She answered them like, you know, a low-IQ person.  The opposite of him — the absolute opposite.  But she gave a horrible answer.  They took the entire answer out, and they put another answer that she gave 20 minutes later into the — in- — as the answer.\nQ    It was part of her word salad.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’ve never even heard of that be- — I thought I heard of it all.\nMR. MUSK:  Right.      Q    That wh- — “60 Minutes” once — one — wanted to do an interview with me, and I said, “Live to tape.”\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah, exactly.\nQ    They said, “No.”  And I said, “No” —\nMR. MUSK:  Right.\nQ    — “No deal.”\nMR. MUSK:  Exactly.  They can- —\nQ    Like, this interview will —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’ve never even heard — you know, I’ve seen where they take a sentence off or something and they’ll do — but they —\nQ    Sometimes you cut for time o- —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  They took the entire — this long, terrible statement that she made and put another.\nNobody’s ever seen what’s happening.  And, you know, the people that do all this complaining, they’re very dishonest people.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.      Q    Yeah.  I — I’m going to, just for the sake of saving time —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    — because I could spend — and I’ve done this on radio and TV, I — I can spend an hour finding the outrageous amounts of money being spent abroad, like USAID.\nMR. MUSK:  Sure.\nQ    And I do want to mention a couple, but I’m going to —\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nQ    — scroll it and —\nMR. MUSK:  Well — well, I guess, at a high level, I think it’s what the president mentioned earlier, which is that in order to save taxpayer money, it comes down to two things: competence and caring.  And —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.\nMR. MUSK:  — and when — when president was shown the outrageous bill for the new Air Force One and — and then negotiated it down, if he had — if the president had not applied competence and caring, the price would have been 50 percent higher — literally, 50 percent higher.  The president cared.  The president was competent.  The price was not 50 percent higher as the result.\nAnd so, when you add more competence and caring, you get a better deal for the American people.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But we could take — we were talking about this yesterday.  I could take — give me thousands of bills — any — I could pick any one of them, and I could —\nMR. MUSK:  Yes, exactly.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — take all thousand.  And let’s say it’s a bill for $5,000 — just $5,000, and it’s done by some bureaucrat.  And if he would say, “I’ll give you three.  I don’t want to pay you five.  It’s too high.  I’ll give you three.”  But they don’t do that.  If a guy sends in a bill for $5,000, they pay $5,000.  They expect to be cut.  Everybody expects to be cut.  When you send in a bill, you expect to be cut.  They send in the bill higher, for the most part.  This is true with lawyers, legal fees.  When they send in legal fees, you — I can cut — I wish I had the time, I would save so — but I could cut these bills in half — much better than half.\nBut you offer people a much lower number because you know they — they actually put fat — I’m not even saying it’s — it’s like a way of business.  They put more on because they expect to be negotiated.  When you send in a bill to the government, there’s nobody to negotiate.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You send it a bill for $10,000, and they send you a check back for $10,000.  If you would call them and said, “We’ll give you five.”  “No, no, no.  I need more than five.”  “We’ll give you a five.”  “I’m not going to pay any more than five.”  “Make it six.”  “No, I’m not going to make it six.”  And you’ll settle for $5,500.  You’ve just cut the bill almost in half, and it took, like, two minutes.  When did that stop?  But —\nQ    (Inaudible) the art of the deal?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — that’s caring.  No, it’s not even the art of the deal.  It’s caring.  He uses the word —\nMR. MUSK:  It’s — it’s competence and caring.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — it’s caring.\nQ    Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s — it’s a certain competence, but I think it’s more caring.\nMR. MUSK:  I — if you —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.)\nMR. MUSK:  Actually, if you add either ingredient — either competence or caring — you’ll — you’ll get a better outcome.  But it stands to reason —\nQ    Right.  People don’t want to do this (inaudible.)\nMR. MUSK: — that’s the reason that if you don’t have competency and you don’t have caring, you’re going to get a terrible deal.  And the problem is that the American taxpayer has been — been getting a terrible deal, because — look at the last administration.  Can you — can anyone — can any reasonable person say that last administration was either competent or caring?\nQ    But they lied to us and said that Joe didn’t have a cognitive decline.\nMR. MUSK:  They fully lied.\nQ    They said the borders were closed.  They said that the borders were secure.  They said that —\nMR. MUSK:  Right.\nQ    You know, they said Obamacare would save —\nMR. MUSK:  They flat out lied.\nQ    They flat out lied —\nMR. MUSK:  It was insane.\nQ    — on many occasions.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nQ    I tell my audience all the time: Don’t trust government.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nQ    So, the — I want — as I scroll this information, and it’s — it’s — I’ll scroll a lot more than I’ll mention to both of you, and this is the cost savings.  I want you — I want people at home to understand this part: The average American makes $66,000 a year.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nQ    Okay?  We have $37 trillion in national debt.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nQ    Now, all the money I’m about to mention and what we’re going to scroll on our screen — and all of this is going to foreign countries.  It is not being spent here in America —\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nQ    — for better schools, law and order.\nMR. MUSK:  I — I think the average taxpaying American should be mad as hell because their tax money is being poorly spent.\nQ    I’m mad.  It’s stealing from —\nMR. MUSK:  It’s a — it’s an outrage —\nQ    — our kids and grandkids.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes, and the — and people —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And a lot of fraud, Sean.  A lot of fraud.\nQ    Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And a lot of kickbacks.\nThey’re sending money out.  They’re not that stupid.  These people aren’t that stupid.  They’re sending for transgender — something having to do with the opera, and they’re sending out $7 million —\nMR. MUSK:  (Laughs.)  Literally.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — $7 million.  (Inaudible) —\nQ    You just stole my next line.  I can’t believe that.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, it’s incredible.\nQ    I was going to mention that.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, but it’s incredible: $7 million.\nNow, you know they — they’re not so stupid.  They’re sending all this money.  They expect to get a lot of it back.  And that’s what happens.\nQ    Okay.  So, let’s go through it.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes, they’re — a bunch of —\nQ    So, for the average person at home —\nMR. MUSK:  — this stuff is round-tripping.  To the president’s point, they’ll — they’ll make it sound like it’s going to help some people in a foreign country, but then they — then they get kickbacks.\nQ    All right.  Let me go to the ne- — to the fir- —\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nQ    — to the second question first.  I want to know, because people like Joni Ernst, and — and House —\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah, Joni — Joni Ernst has been —\nQ    They tried to get —\nMR. MUSK:  — has tried for a long time, and she’s actually got a lot of good data.  Senator Ernst has been really helpful, actually.\nQ    Okay, but they — they actually hide what the real purpose of the spending is.\nMR. MUSK:  That’s true.\nQ    In other words, they — and — and h- — this is a question: How did you decipher?  It will say, “Humanitarian blah, blah, blah in Serbia or Afghanistan.”  We’ve been giving money to China for crying out loud, which I think is nuts.\nMR. MUSK:  Well, we’re giving money to the Taliban.\nQ    Money to the Taliban?\nMR. MUSK:  Like a lot.\nQ    All right.  So —\nMR. MUSK:  (Laughs.)  I’m like, for what?\nQ    But they —\nMR. MUSK:  I — I want to see pictures of what they did.\nQ    But they try to obscure it, and — and — but then you got to the bottom line, which is what I’m now scrolling on the screen —\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nQ    — and that is: $20 million on a Sesame Street show in Iraq; $56 million to boost tourism in Tunisia and Egypt; $40 million to build schools in Jordan; $11 million to tell the Vietnamese to stop burning trash; $45 million for DEI scholarships in Burma; $520 million for consultant-driven ESG investments in Africa; DEI programs in Serbia; the president’s favorite — I’m sure you — you love that taxpayer money was spent on a DEI musical in Ireland or a chan- — transgender opera in Colombia or a —\nMR. MUSK:  If I could, like, it sounds like —\nQ    — transgender comic book in Peru.\nMR. MUSK:  It sounds like — it sounds like how can these things be real?  But this is actually what was done.\nQ    Okay.  The — I —\nMR. MUSK:  It — it sounds like a comedy sketch or something.  It’s like —\nQ    I have 20 pages of this.\nMR. MUSK:  Right.  It’s not — the list is a mile long.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  The one thing you didn’t mention, the media.  The media is getting millions of dollars.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Now, they say Politico, which is a radical left —\nQ    Subscriptions.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — you know, garbage magazine or — or program.  I guess they have magazine and they have some — some media of all types.  $8 million.\nI hear the New York Times got a lot.  I hear they get subscriptions — where they have subscriptions but maybe the paper is not sent.  I have no idea if that’s true or not, but it’s — they call it subscriptions.  Lots of subscri- — to different media, not just the Times — maybe the Times, and maybe not the Times.\nQ    A million dollars in subscriptions is a lot.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well — but — but millions of dollars going to media that’s radical-left, crooked, dishonest media.\nMR. MUSK:  Well — well, Reuters — this is actually really wild: Reuters got like — something like $10 million for something that was literally titled “mass disinformation campaign.”\nQ    Well —\nMR. MUSK:  That was on the purchase order.  Well, I — I\nthought that was a little bold.  (Laughs.)\nQ    I will tell you what was bold is when you released —\nMR. MUSK:  I’m like —\nQ    — the Twitter files.\nMR. MUSK:  — shouldn’t you at least try to call it something else?  (Laughs.)\nQ    The Twitter files — how they targeted him; how Twitter, at the time, worked closely with the FBI, the CIA; and, even before the release of Hunter’s very real laptop, they were feeding them disinformation.  That —\nMR. MUSK:  Absolutely.\nQ    — you found all that out.\nMR. MUSK:  Well, I think —\nQ    That’s called transparency, right?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  The FBI has to be rehabbed.  The FBI —\nMR. MUSK:   Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  What’s happened with the FBI and the DOJ is just — their — their stock has gone way down.  I mean, their reputation is shot.\nQ    And intelligence.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And I think Pam is going to do great.  I think Kash is going to do great.  I think they have to do great or we have a problem.\nBut when you look at what they did, the raid of Mar-a-Lago — the raid of Mar-a-Lago — you look at what they did, their reputation is shot.\nQ    It is.\nWhat — you were going to say, Elon?\nMR. MUSK:  Well, no, I was going to say that I think probably a — like, a lot of people still —\nQ    How — how did you find (inaudible)?\nMR. MUSK:  — still believe, like, the Russia hoax, even though you’ve done a lot to combat that.  The — you know, the — the Steele dossier was an incre- — a massive scam that was concocted by Hillary Clinton and her — her campaign.\nQ    She bought and paid it — for it —\nMR. MUSK:  Right.\nQ    — Russian disinformation.\nMR. MUSK:  There was — it was — the — people still think the — the Russia hoax is real.  Like a lot of people s- — because they never — they never heard the counterpoint.  I mean — I mean, a bunch of people should be in prison for that.  That was a — that was outrageous election interference, creating a fake Russia hoax.\nQ    How much — if you had to put a number on it, how much do you think you’ve identified waste, fraud, abuse, corruption at this point?  And again, we’ve been — we’re going to be scrolling this throughout the program.\nMR. MUSK:  Well, the — the overall goal is to try to get a trillion dollars out of the deficit.  And if we — if we — if the deficit is not brought under control, America will go bankrupt.  This is a very important thing for people to understand.  A country is no different from an individual, in that if an individual overspends, an individual can go bankrupt, and so can a country.\nAnd — and the out- — the massive waste, fraud, and abuse that has been going on, which is leading to a $2-trillion-a-year deficit, that — that’s what the president was handed on Jan. 20th, a $2 trillion deficit.  It’s insane.\nQ    For this fiscal year?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Two trill- — yeah.  We inherited it.\nMR. MUSK:  Two —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  And inflation is back.  I’m only here for two and a half weeks.\nQ    That was January —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Inflating is back —\nQ    — you were there for a week.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, think of it, inflation is back.  And they said, “Oh, Trump infla-” — I had nothing to do with it.  These people have — have run the country.  They spent money like nobody has ever spent.  They were — they were given $9 trillion to throw out the window — $9 trillion, and they spent it on the Green New Scam, I call it.  It’s the greatest scam in the history of the country.  One of them.  We have a lot of them, I guess.  But one of them.\nQ    Well —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Dollar-wise, probably —\nQ    — and DEI —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — it is.\nQ    — and wokeism —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, yeah.\nQ    — and transgenderism —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, that’s all part of it.  Yeah.\nQ    — and LGBTQ+.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nQ    And, by the way, not in America — other countries, not here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You know, the amazing thing is when you see, like, the teaching of DEI: $9 million.  How do you spend $9 million to teach no matter what it is?\nMR. MUSK:  Right.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You could teach physics.\nMR. MUSK:  Exactly.  Totally.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You could go to MIT for a lot less.\nMR. MUSK:  It’s (inaudible) expensive.  (Laughs.)  Expensive.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, the teaching —\nMR. MUSK:  Expensive BS.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — of DEI.\nQ    Well, I think it would be better spent on —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, it’s a kickback.  It’s got to be a kickback.  Nobody is that — nobody could do that.  Nobody is —\nQ    Well, it —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Nobody is giving — to assess the dialog of an audience coming out of a theater: $4 million.\nQ    How much do you believe, Elon, you’ve identified in — in waste, fraud, abuse, corruption now?  And how much —\nMR. MUSK:  Well —\nQ    — do you anticipate you will?\nMR. MUSK:  Sure.  Well, the — I — I think —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  One percent.\nMR. MUSK:  (Laughs.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, because it’s so massive.  It’s — this is —\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah, exactly.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — huge money.  Huge money.  Look —\nQ    So, what we’ve found now is one percent?\nMR. MUSK:  Well, we’ve j- — we’ve just gotten started here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  As good as they are, they’re not going to find some contract that was crooked — you know, crooked as hell.  And, I mean, there’s going to be so much that isn’t found.  But what is found — I think he’s going to find a trillion dollars.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah, I think so.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But I think it’s a very small percentage compared to what it is.  I mean, he could tell you about treasuries; he could tell you about a woman that worked for Biden that became a very wealthy woman while she was working for him.  Right?\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nQ    Yeah, I know who you’re talking about.\nMR. MUSK:  I mean, there are some strange situations where people — where, you know, someone’s working for the government earning $200,000 a year, and then, suddenly, they’re worth tens of millions of dollars within a few years.  Where’d the money come?\nQ    How’d they earn it?\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nQ    They have a private company on the side?\nMR. MUSK:  We’re just curious.  Like, can you —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  While they were working.\nMR. MUSK:  Can you show us — because, like, in order to be worth tens of millions of dollars, you’d have to start a company, or you’ve got to get some kind — the compensation has got to come from somewhere.  So, how does a civil servant with — earning $200,000 a year suddenly, within a span of a few years, be worth tens of millions dollars?\nQ    W- —\nMR. MUSK:  So, I just want to connect the dots here.\nQ    All right, s- —\nMR. MUSK:  Maybe there’s a legitimate explanation, but I don’t think so.  (Laughter.)\nQ    So, you know, and this gets to kind of the heart of where I am.  I — I looked at your work, and I look at this amount of money, and I get angry.  And I don’t get v- — I’m not an angry person.\nMR. MUSK:  Sure.\nQ    I don’t get angry.  I get a- — I get annoyed sometimes, but I don’t get angry.\nAnd I did live paycheck to bay- — paycheck a part of my life.  And I think of, you know, the working men and women in this country that the — 56 percent of which cannot afford a $1,000 emergency after four years of Harris and Biden.\nMR. MUSK:  Sure.\nQ    Okay?  That is serious, you know, financial trouble.  Or they’re putting bare necessities on credit cards.\nAnd I’m looking at this and I’m thinking, well, how much — when we — when all is said and done, we could have written a check or cut the taxes or fixed our schools —\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.  Yes.\nQ    — or deported these illegals that we keep finding, known terrorists, cartel members, gang members.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nQ    And — and we’re not doing it.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Sean, the saddest thing is they don’t talk about the individual lines.  I could go on your show right now,  I could get a list that I have on the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, and it’s got 40 points, and all they are is the heading of what this money is.\nYou don’t have to go deep into it, and you see it’s, you know, all different things and it’s so ridiculous.\nI mean, normally, when you look for fraud, you’re looking for one thing out of a hundred.  Here, out of a hundred, 95 are going to be bad.  I mean, they’re — and they’re so obvious just by the heading.\nBut they never mention that.  They only mention, “This is a violation of our Constitution.  This is a” — the word they give, you know, it’s like a sound bite — “constitutional crisis.”  It’s a new thing, “constitution-” —  But they never mention about where the money is going.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.  Exactly.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And when people hear that — I had a very smart man, John Kennedy — he’s actually a very smart man.  He said, “Sir, you should just go on television and just read the name of the topic that you’re giving all the money — just the topic that you’re giving this money to, and don’t say anything more,” and he’s right.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And I’ll do it at some point, you know, when —\nBut they never talk about where the money is going.  They just talk about, “It’s a constitutional crisis.”\nIt’s so sad.  And honestly, I think they’re bad people.  I used to give them the benefit of the doubt, but you almost think they hate the country.  I think they hate the country.  They’re sick people.\nQ    Remember, what they can’t — what they couldn’t accomplish at the ballot box, what they can’t accomplish legislatively, now they’re using the courts.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nQ    And they c- — they’re trying to bury you in lawsuits.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  You know the good news, though?  They’ve lost their confidence.  They’re not the same people.\nQ    I think you’re right.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They’re — they’re not the same people.\nThis election was brutal for them.  We won every swing state.  We won by millions and millions of votes.  We won everything.  We — all 50 states went up — all 50.  It’s never happened.\nQ    Popular vote.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Every one.  All 50 states went up.\nThey’ve lost their confidence.  I see it.  And they’re — they’re just swirling and twirling.  They don’t know what the hell is happening.  They’re much different.  They’re just as mean, but they’re not getting to the point.\nQ    Why do you invite them into the Oval Office nearly every day?\nMR. MUSK:  (Laughs.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, the media — you’re talking about the media.\nQ    Yeah, your friends in the media.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  The media — no, they’re — you know, the anger that — they ask questions so angry — a question — a normal question.  I give them an answer.  They — but they — I say, “Why are you so angry when you ask a question?”  Just a standard question.  And, I don’t know, there’s something —\nQ    They haven’t had a- — they haven’t been allowed in that office for the last four years, and here you’re giving them access.\nLet me go to an area that I think is key, and — and you talked about this in recent interviews, and that is: We don’t need a Department of Education.  Okay.  And what some people are trying to do is stoke fears that, “Oh, my gosh, my kid is not going to get the money for education.”\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  Yeah.\nQ    Or “grandma’s Social Security and Medicare.”  This was a big promise of yours on the campaign trail.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Yeah.\nQ    So, I really want to give you both an opportunity to assure the American people you will keep — that money will be allocated for students, but with higher standards.  For example, I would assume associated with monies given or vouchers.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible) so much and — and then Elon goes.  But, look, Social Security won’t be touched —\nQ    Won’t be touched.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — other than if there’s fraud or something — we’re going to find it; it’s going to be strengthened — but won’t be touched.  Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.  It’s just —\nQ    Nothing.  I want you to —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible) don’t have to.\nNow, if there are illegal migrants in the system, we’re going to get them out of the system, and all of that fraud.  But it’s not going to be touched.\nSchool — I want to bring school back to the states, so that Iowa, Indiana — all these places — Idaho, New Hampshire — there’s so many places, the states.  I figure 35 really run well.\nAnd right now, it’s Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, China — China, can you imagine? — has top — top schools.  We’re last.\nSo, they have a list of 40 countries.  We’re number 40.  Usually we’re 38, 39, but last time, we were number 40.  And what I say is you’ve got to give it back.\nSo, it doesn’t work.\nI’ll tell you what we’re number one in: cost per pupil.  We spend more money than any other country by far — it’s not even close — per pupil.  Okay?  So, we know it doesn’t work.\nSo, we spend the most and we have the worst — right? — the worst result.  When we give that — when we give that back to Indiana, when we give that b- — back to Iowa and back to a lot of the states that run well — they run well, a lot of them — 35, 37, 38 — now, you’re going to have 10 laggards, but you’re going to have 5 real laggards, but that’s going to be okay.\nTake New York — you give it to Westchester County, you give it to Suffolk County, you give it to Upstate New York, and you give it to Manhattan — but you give it to four or five subsections.  Same thing in California.  Los Angeles is going to be a problem, but you’re going to give it to places that run well.  We can change education\nNow, school choice is important, but that will get care — taken care of automatically.\nWe want to bring education back to the states.  You will spend half the number.  And I’m not even doing this —\nQ    So, you’re leaning more towards grants not vouchers, like to parents?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’m not even — I’m not even doing this to save, but you will save.  It will cost you much less money.  You get a much better education.\nIf you go to some of these states, you’ll be the equivalent of Norway, Sweden, Denmark — places that really have a good school system.  You’ll have — those places will be the equivalent, and your overall numbers will get so much better.\nQ    Do you want standards associated with the money?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  The only thing I want to do from — from Washington, D.C., is make sure they’re teaching English, reading, writing —\nQ    Math and science.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — and arithmetic.  Okay?\nQ    Science?  Science might help.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  A little science.  You know —\nQ    Computers.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — you’re not going to have much of a problem with that, but that’s it.\nDo you know, we have half the buildings — I mean, you look at Department of Education —\nMR. MUSK:  It’s empty.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Look at the real estate and the —\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — the level.  For what?  To — to — I mean, for — what do they do?\nWe have really bad educa- — the teachers — I love teachers.  I respect teachers.  And, by the way, there’s no reason why teachers can’t form a union.  They can do whatever they want to do, if it’s back in the states.  So, we’re not looking to hurt the teacher — I’m — I’m going to help the teachers.  I think the teachers should be incentivized, because a good teacher is like a good scientist, is like a great doctor.\nMR. MUSK:  Sure.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s a valuable commodity.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think they should be incentivized.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, I’m totally for the teachers.\nMR. MUSK:  Absolutely.\nQ    I interview a guy a lot on radio.  He’s from Wichita, Kansas.  And he started —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\nQ    — as a medical doctor.  Started Atlas.MD, and he’s now — he’s rolled it out nationwide.  Concierge care, $50 a month, 24-hour access to a doctor.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\nQ    You know, they use a lot of telemedicine now as part of it — very innovative.  He negotiates directly with pharmaceutical companies.  People — if they have high blood pressure, they walk out with their medicine.  They have high cholesterol, they walk out with their medicine.  And they pay pennies on the dollar.\nYou mentioned —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  By the way, forms of that could be done.\nQ    Forms of that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Forms of that could be done.\nQ    Innovation.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We got hurt when we didn’t get the vote on Obamacare.  I made Obamacare — I had a choice: I could let it rot and win a point, or I could do the best you could do with it.  And that’s what I did.  We did a great job with it, and we made it sort of work, but it’s lousy.  We could do so much better.\nAnd when you say — you go to certain areas, they — they have doctors round the clock.  They have great medical care for a fraction of what we’re paying right now.\nThere are things we could do.\nBut, look, just overall, this man has been so valuable.  I hate to see the way they go after him.  They go after him.  It’s so unfair.  He doesn’t need this.  He wants to do this.\nFirst of all, this is bigger than anything he’s ever done.  He’s done great companies and all, but this is much — you know, this is trillion — everything’s trillions, right?\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.  The numbers are crazy.\nQ    To go back to my original point —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He can save —\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nQ    But let me — give him his $10 million back.\nMR. MUSK:  Well — well — I — no.  So, people ask me, like, “What’s — what’s the — what’s the — what’s, like, the — what’s your biggest surprise in — in D.C.?”  And I’m like, “The sheer scale.”\nQ    It’s massive.  So, you love the challenge?\nMR. MUSK:  Well, I mean, to —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’ll never do anything bigger.\nMR. MUSK:  To the president’s point —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s the only thing you can say, “He’ll\nnever do anything” —\nMR. MUSK:  But, I mean, you do something slightly better, and you save billions of dollars for the American taxpayer — just slightly better.  Slightly.  (Laughs.)\nQ    When you say “tech support” —\nMR. MUSK:  You go one percent better, and it’s, like, you know, tens of billions of dollars saved to the American taxpayer.\nNow, if I may address the point that you — the question you asked earlier, which is, you know, how do we assure people that —\nQ    They want to know.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah, how do we assure people that we’re going to do the right thing, that their — that their Social Security benefits will be there, that their — the medical care will be good and s- — and — in fact, how do we make it — ensure that there’s better medical care in the future?  How do we improve their benefits?  How do we make sure that their Social Security check goes further than it did in the past and not — it doesn’t get weakened by inflation?\nSo, the — if we — if we address the — the massive deficit spending, the sort of — the — the waste in the government, then — then we can actually address inflation.\nSo, provided the economy grows faster than the money supply, which means you stop the government overspending and the waste, and the output of real useful goods and services exceeds the increase in the money supply, you have no inflation.\nQ    Yeah.\nMR. MUSK:  And — and you also drop the — the interest payments that people pay, because if the government keeps —\nQ    Way too high.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.  The — the reason the interest payments are so high is because the — the national debt keeps increasing.  So, the — the government is competing for — to sell debt with — for — with — with the private citizens.  This drives up the interest rate.\nSo, if you have a — if you have a — if you cut back on the deficit, you actually have an amazing situation for people, because you get r- — you get rid of inflation and you drop the interest rates.  And that means people’s mortgage payments go down, their credit card payments go down, their car payments go down, their student loans go down.  Everything — their — their life becomes more affordable and they’re standard of living improves.\nQ    How quickly?  Because I think people are suffering now.  We’re still living under the Biden-Harris economy.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But, Sean, you have states right now —\nQ    Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You have some states that operate that way.  They operate as well as any corporation.  They really operate well.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nQ    Florida.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They have surpluses.  They ha- — they don’t —\nMR. MUSK:  Texas is — has a surplus, for example.\nQ    Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  When they — when they look at New York and — and California and some of these places that should have an advantage — I mean, there’s a big advantage — or Pritzker does such a bad job in Illinois; it’s horrible how bad he is — and they don’t have that advantage.\nYou know, New York has stock exchange and a lot of things.  And California has the weather and the beautiful water and all the thing- —\nMR. MUSK:  California has — has great weather.  The most expensive weather on Earth.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  (Laughter.)  But — but —\nQ    I like Florida.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But some states operate the way he’s talking about.\nQ    Efficiently.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  When you go into some of these states, you’re going to find very little.  You’re going to find almost nothing.  They really operate well — big surpluses, low taxes.  And —\nQ    You know, my taxes went up the first time you were president, because you took away the SALT deduction —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I — well, I did.\nQ    — which, by the way, I thought was the right decision.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It was the right decision — in fact, Reagan tried to do it — because it rewards badly run states.\nBut at the same time, it’s a tough — it was — it’s tough for the states.  I mean, it really is tough for the states.\nThe sad part is it rewards really badly run states.\nQ    Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And Reagan tried to do it.  He was unable to do it.  I got it done.\nQ    You got it done, and —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And now we’re going to give some back.\nQ    A little bit.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Because you know what?  We’ve got to help them.\nQ    It’s only a little.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’ve got to help.\nQ    Because otherwi- — we’re encouraging people to elect high taxes, spen- —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Nobody had any idea it would be that devastating.  I did the right thing.  I got something that Reagan couldn’t do.  I got it done, where everybody is — are the same.  But you know what?  We’ve got to help them out.\nQ    Reagan had the Grace Commission, some of the best business minds in the country.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\nQ    And they came up with recommendations.  Congress adopted none of them, and none of them were implemented.\nI’ve got to ask this question, because the media is obsessed about it: What — what if there is a conflict?  In other words, because you do business — it was funny, when it came out the other day, that there was going to be, I think, $400 million — billio- — I don’t know if it was millions or billions — a lot of money on Teslas that Joe Biden’s administration w- — did with Tesla, and —\nMR. MUSK:  I’m not familiar with that.\nQ    You’re not even familiar with it?  But —\nMR. MUSK:  I — I don’t think — are you talking about, like, the Inflation Reduction Act stuff or —\nQ    It was some — it was a purchase order of Tesla vehicles.\nMR. MUSK:  Oh.  Oh, that was — that was incorrect.  There was s- — like, there’s some sort of — the media claim that there was, like, $400 million worth of Cybertrucks —\nQ    That was it.\nMR. MUSK:  — being bought by the DOD.\nQ    And that he gave it to you.\nMR. MUSK:  No — well, first of all, that was —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, actually, it was —\nMR. MUSK:  Th- — it was fa- —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It was Biden.\nQ    It was Biden.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And you know Biden wouldn’t give him much.\nMR. MUSK:  But — but it wasn’t even — it was fake news, six weeks to Sunday.  Tesla is not getting $400 million for Cybertrucks.  And the — and the — and this alleged —\nQ    That’s what it was, Cybertrucks.\nMR. MUSK:  This — yeah.  This alleged award occurred in December, before the president took office.  So, it’s — it’s fake on multiple levels.  There i- — Tesla isn’t getting $400 million.  And even if it — even if it was, which it isn’t, it was awarded during the Biden administration.\nQ    Okay, but you’re — you — you —\nMR. MUSK:  It’s total fake news.\nQ    There — there is —\nMR. MUSK:  It’s fake on, like — it’s like multiple leverals —\nQ    There is some integration —\nMR. MUSK:  — multiple layers of fake.\nQ    So, you’re — you’re tasked now — and I pray to God this is successful.  I really do.  I wish you Godspeed.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nQ    You know, “Godspeed, John Glenn.”\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s — it’s going to be, by the way.  I really believe it’s going to be.\nQ    But — but there —\nMR. MUSK:  Oh, yeah.\nQ    But there are legitimate areas —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Because the country is going to do well beside this.\nThis is cutting.  We’re only talking about cutting.\nWe’re also going to make a lot of money.  We’re g- — we’re taking in so much money.\nQ    But what about his business?  What if — if there is —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Then we won’t let him do it.\nQ    — a contract he would otherwise get?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’re not going to let him do it.  He — if —\nQ    You’re not going to let him do it?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  If he’s got a conflict — I mean, look — he —\nQ    Y- — now y- —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s in certain areas — I mean, I see this morning — I didn’t — I didn’t know, but I said, “Do the right thing” — where they’re cutting way back on the electric vehicle subsidies.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They’re cutting back.\nQ    You’re losing —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Not only cutting back —\nQ    It hurts you.\nMR. MUSK:  Correct.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nNow, I will tell you —\nQ    You don’t care?\nMR. MUSK:  Well —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s probably not that happy with it, but that would have been one thing he would have come to me and said, “Listen, you got to do me a favor.  This is crazy.”  (Laughter.)  But this was in the tax bill.  They’re cutting back on the subsidies.\nI didn’t — I wasn’t involved in it.  I said, “Do what’s right, and you get” — and they’re coming up with the tax, but it’s just preliminary.\nBut I mean, if he were involved, wouldn’t you think he’d probably do that?  Now, maybe he does better if you cut back on the subsidies.  Who knows.  Because he figures — he does think differently.  He thinks he has a better product, and as long as he has a level playing field, he doesn’t care what you do —     MR. MUSK:  Exactly.     THE PRESIDENT:  — which he’s very — he’s told me that.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.  I mean, I haven’t asked the president for anything ever.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s true.\nQ    And if it comes up, how — how will you handle it?  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He won’t be involved.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah, I’ll — I’ll re- — I’ll recuse myself if it is a conflict.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  If there’s a conflict, he won’t be involved.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I mean, I wouldn’t want that, and he won’t want it.\nMR. MUSK:  Right.  And — and also, I’m getting a — sort of a daily proctology exam here.  You know, it’s not like I’ll be getting away from something in the dead of night.\nQ    Welcome to D.C.  If you want a friend, get a dog.\nMR. MUSK:  Well, I do have a dog, but I also have friends.  (Laughter.)  My dog loves me, poor little creature.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You know the truth was —\nMR. MUSK:  I need to bring him to D.C.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s — I know every businessman.  I know the — the good ones, the bad ones, the smart ones, the lucky ones.  I know them all.  This guy is a ver- — he’s a brilliant guy.  He’s a great guy.  He’s got tremendous imagination and scientific imagin- — far beyond — you know, you keep talking about a technologist and all, but you’re much more than a technologist.  You are that.  But he’s also a good person.  He’s a very good person, and he wants to see the country do well.\nAnd I know a lot of great businesspeople, really great business people, but, you know, they’re not really, in some cases, very good people.  And I know people that would try and take advantage of the situation.\nThis guy is somebody that really cares for the country, and I saw that very early on.  I saw it, really, a long time ago when I got to know him.  He’s a very different kind of a character.\nThat’s why — you know who loves him: young people that are very smart and that love the country.  He’s got, like, a tremendous following, because that’s what he’s — he’s a good person.\nAnd he doesn’t need this.  He didn’t need this, and he’s doing this to help the country.  If I didn’t win this election, this country was — I don’t think it could have made it.  I don’t — I mean, we’re allowing criminals — millions of criminals into our country, where everything is transgender, it’s men playing in women’s sports.\nI mean, none of this stuff — you could go — I could give you a hundred things.  It’s almost like they’re trying to destroy the fabric of — of the country, of the world, because the world was following us.  Now the world is following us out of this pit.\nWe’ve done a lot.  I’ll tell you what, in three weeks, we’ve done more — I think we’ve done more — in — in terms of meaningful, not just dollars — than maybe any president ever.  And a lot of people are saying that.\nQ    Shock — it’s been shock and awe.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I mean, if we can keep it going at this level, this country is going to be at a level that it’s never seen before.\nQ    You know one of the things you did that I really thought was pretty clever and smart and fair, and that was reciprocal tariffs.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, reciprocal.\nQ    Ta- — I didn’t know India charged so much.  I didn’t know the European Union to charge them.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah, totally.\nQ    I didn’t know Canada was charging us.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Everybody.  Everybody.  Everybody but us.\nQ    Brazil, why?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And I was doing it — you know, I charged China tariffs.  I took in hundreds of billions of dollars, and I was doing that.  But when we got — we had the greatest economy in history.  But then we got hit with COVID, and we had to solve that problem, because I was doing it — and now I said, I want to come back and do the recipri- — because every country in the world almost — we have a deficit with almost every country — not every one, but just about, pretty close.\nAnd — but every country in the world takes advantage of us, and they do it with tariffs.  They makes — make it — it’s impossible for him to sell a car, practically, in, as an example, India.  I don’t know if that’s true or not, but I think —\nMR. MUSK:  The tariffs are like 100 percent import duty.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  The tariffs are so high —\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — they don’t want to — now, if he built the factory in India, that’s okay, but that’s unfair to us.  It’s very unfair.\nAnd I said, “You know what we do?”  I told Prime Minister Modi yesterday — he was here.  I said, “Here’s what you do.  We’re going to do — be very fair with you.”  They charge the highest tariffs in the world, just about.\nQ    36 percent?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, much — much higher.\nMR. MUSK:  It’s 100 percent on — auto imports are 100 percent.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, that’s peanuts.  So, much higher.  And — and others too.  I said, “Here’s what we’re going to do: reciprocal.  Whatever you charge, I’m charging.”  He goes, “No, no, I don’t like that.”  “No, no, whatever you charge, I’m going to charge.”  I’m doing that with every country.\nMR. MUSK:  It seems fair.\nQ    Don’t you —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  It does.\nMR. MUSK:  It’s — it’s like fair is fair.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Nobody can argue with me.  You know, the media can’t argue — I said — they said, “Tariffs — you’re going to charge tariffs?”  You know, if I said, like, 25 percent they’d say, “Oh, that’s terrible.”  I don’t say that anymore —\nQ    Can I — (inaudible) —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — because I say, “Whatever they charge, we’ll charge.”  And you know what?      Q    They stop.     THE PRESIDENT:  They — then they say, “Oh, that sounds fair.”\nMR. MUSK:  All the president is saying is that —     Q    (Inaudible.)     MR. MUSK:  — it needs to be at a level playing field and — and fair and square.\nQ    Yeah.  And how does — how —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And we’re going to make a lot of money and a lot of businesses are going to come pouring in.\nMR. MUSK:  How can you argue with a fair and square situation?\nQ    Don’t — don’t you think most of them will look at the — the — for example, without America, China’s economy will tank.  They need our business.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They do.  Everybody needs us.\nQ    Everybody needs it.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And you know what?\nQ    Do- — don’t you think they’ll stop?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We only have so long left where we’re in this position.  We’re the bank, and the bank is getting smaller and smaller and smaller.  We — we’re the bank.  We got to do this now.  We can’t wait another 10 years and have a shell of a country left, because that’s what was going to happen.\nQ    Mr. President —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  This country — if I didn’t win this election and have people like this man right here that really do care, because that’s the other word — if you don’t care, you could be the smartest guy in the world, it’s not going to matter.  But if we didn’t win this election, I’m telling you, we would not have had a country for very long.\nQ    How quickly —\nMR. MUSK:  May I say —\nQ    — do you balance the budget and — and when do we start paying down that debt?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, potentially, very quickly, between what he’s doing and with income coming in from tariffs and other things.  I mean, I hope we can — I don’t want to give a date, because then these people are going to say, “Oh, well, he didn’t make the date.”  But I think we can do it very quickly.\nWe would have never done it if this didn’t happen.  Never.  It would have never been — it would only get worse and worse, and ultimately, it would have exploded.\nThis country was headed down a very bad track.  And the whole DEI thing, that was — that was a trap.  That was a sick trap.\nQ    (Inaudible.)     MR. MUSK:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And, you know, we’ve destroyed that.  That’s gone.  That’s pretty much gone.\nQ    I agree.      MR. MUSK:  (Inaudible) —     Q    We’re not — we’re not funding it.\nMR. MUSK:  If — I really want to — I really want to emphasize to people that — this is a very important point — if we don’t solve the deficit, there won’t be money for medical care.  There won’t be money —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\nMR. MUSK:  — for Social Security.  We either solve the deficit or all we’ll be doing is paying debt.\nQ    Nobody —\nMR. MUSK:  It’s — it’s got to be solved, or there’s no medical care, there’s no Social Security, there’s no nothing.  That’s got to be solved.  It’s not optional.  America will go bankrupt if this is not done.  That’s why I’m here.\nQ    The president’s —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Europe takes advantage of us.\nMR. MUSK:  And — and I’d like to also just send a message — like, because, as the president said, like, this — there’s a lot of rich people out there.  They should be caring more about the country because — the reason they should be caring about — more about country is: America falls, what do you think is going to happen to your business?  What do — what do you think — do you think you’re be going to be okay if — if the ship of America sinks?  Of course not.\nLike, what — what I’m doing here, what the president is doing is it’s just long-term thinking.  The ship of America must be strong.  The ship of America cannot sink.  If it sinks, we all sink with it.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Sean, you’re a —\nQ    This is what — this is what drives you?\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nQ    This is important.  It says “tech support.”  So, you’re not trying to be president, as the media suggests.  You are really here because your heart and your passion is this.  And the president described you as being — this is the biggest thing you ever done.  Now you trying to bring sight to —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  There could be nothing bigger.  There’s nothing —\nQ    You’re sending ships up to Mars — you know, spaceships up in the sky all the time —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s peanuts.\nQ    — and saving astronauts.  That’s pretty big.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s peanuts compared to what we’re talking about.\nQ    It’s peanuts?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    Do you agree with that?\nMR. MUSK:  Well, it’s esse- — it’s essential that America be healthy, that America’s economy be strong.  And — and if that — if — basically, like, my concern is like, if — if — America is the central pillar holding up Western civilization.  That pillar must be strong.  If that pillar falls, the whole roof comes crashing down.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Including his ships.\nMR. MUSK:  There’s no place to hide.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Including his ships going up.\nMR. MUSK:  There’s no place to run.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Nothing.  There’s nothing left.\nQ    Why — why, if this is your goal, your motivation, you’re losing money in the process, you’re offeri- — you do all these nice things for people for free; you’re trying to solve, you know, blindness; you’re going to rescue astronauts; you help the people in North Carolina, California; you’re cutting money that was sent abroad that’s not helping the American people, then why the rage —\nMR. MUSK:  Actually, I think it was like —     Q    But why this rage?     MR. MUSK:  — it was not helping the American people and hurting people overseas, to be clear.\nQ    Why this rage against you now?  First, they hated him.  Now they hate both of you.\nMR. MUSK:  Well, I think we’re seeing an antibody reaction from — from those who are receiving the — the wasteful and fraudulent money.\nQ    They’re being exposed.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nQ    Nobody wants to be exposed when you’re corrupt.\nMR. MUSK:  I’ll — I’ll tell you a lesson I learned at PayPal.  You know who complained the loudest — the quickest and the loudest and with the most amount of righteous indignation?  The fraudsters.  That’s who complained first, loudest, and — and they would generally have this immense overreaction.  That’s how we knew there were the fraudsters.  That’s how we knew.  There’s a tell.\nQ    What di- — I’ve never — I’ve never met you before today.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nQ    And it’s nice to meet you, by the way.  Thank — thank you for doing this.\nYou guys are really friends.  I could s- — you guys — I could see you kicking up your shoes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, he doesn’t do this kind of thing.  And the way I figured that you’d get to know him is if I did it with him.  I said, “Come on, let’s do it together.”  He doesn’t do this.\nI think he’s smarter not doing it, overall.  Because, you know, I mean, he’s done very well without doing it.  But he doesn’t feel it’s really worthwhile.  He wants the product to speak for itself, or whatever he does speak for itself.  But he views it as — you know, does it matter?\nAnd I’m doing this with you today because I wanted to have people understand him.  And I think it’s very important — I disagree with him.  I think it’s very important that they do understand him.\nHe doesn’t need this.  He doesn’t need it.  Now, I happen to think it’s made him very popular.  I think it — he’s more popular now because there are so many people — you know, you’re talking about the radical left — they have the lowest ratings.  MSNBC is dying.  CNN is dying.  They’re all dying.  The New York Times is doing lousy.  The Washington Post is doing horribly.  They’re all doing badly because people don’t buy it anymore.\nBut I think it was important that he do this one interview.  You’ve been a very fair guy.  I think you were the right guy to do it.  If we could get some radical left guy — and he’d do just as well, frankly, because it’s all about common sense.\nQ    They would attack him —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But this — Sean —\nQ    — as being unconstitutional, not — a fascist.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — to me this was a — it was important for people to understand, he’s doing a big job.  He’s doing a very thankless job.  He’s doing a thankless job, but he’s helping us to save our country.\nOur country was in serious trouble, and I had to get the best guy, somebody with credibility, because if he were just a regular, good — very good, solid businessman, he wouldn’t have the credibility.  He’s got the best credibility for this.\nAnd people also know he’s an honest guy.  He’s an honest guy.  He’s just a very, very smart guy who’s done amazing things.  And this will be the biggest thing he’s ever done, because, you know, his companies are all great.  But if this country goes bad — I guess where he is a little selfish is this.  He knows one thing and probably doesn’t think — but if his — if this country goes bad, his stuff is not going to be worth very much, I can tell you.\nMR. MUSK:  Well, I’d say, if the — if the ship of America sinks, we’re all go- — going down with it.  You know, this idea that people can escape to New Zealand or some other place is false.  If the central pillar of Western civilization that is America falls, the whole roof comes crashing down and there is no escape.\nQ    It’s amazing, since you’ve been elected, to watch Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia — I — I was shocked at the statements that Vladimir Putin made about you.  I — I was shocked at the hostage release.  I was shocked that Venezuela had done it — had done it.  Zelenskyy wants a deal.  Putin wants a deal.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  All good statements.\nQ    King Abdullah was interested.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You mean by that all good statements.  Look, they respect the president of this country.  They respect — they did not respect the last president.  They laughed at him, and they laughed at our country, and he’s done great damage to our country.\nQ    Have foreign leaders told you what they thought of Biden?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, they have, but I’d rather not say.  They — they have.  It’s not — it — look —\nQ    It’s the obvious.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He was not George Washington, let’s put it that way.\nMR. MUSK:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Not the greatest.\nQ    Sorry, if that’s (inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s done a tremendous disservice.\nQ    Will you be here —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And, by the way, the Democrats have done a great disservice, and they ought to get their act together and use a little judgment, and they ought to work with us on straightening out this mess that —\nQ    Who?  John Fetterman?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — a lot of people have —\nQ    Maybe?  Who — what Democrat is not radicalized?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Actually, you mention John.\nQ    John Fetterman.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s become the best voice in the Democrat party.  You know, I had lunch with him, and I thought he was terrific, but he’s a much different man than he was before he had this difficulty.  He used to be radical left, and I think he became much smarter, actually.  He’s really — he’s really a voice of reason.\nBut the Democrats have to get together.  They have to get their act together, because the stuff they — they talk about makes no sense.  It makes — none whatsoever.  And they must know it.  They must know.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.  I mean, like, the country has spoken very clearly and rejected the core tenets of the Demo- — Democratic Party.  The country voted t- — fo- — I mean, the country made the — America has made its vote clear.  The president won the popular vote decisively.  The Republicans won the House.  Repub- — Republicans won the Senate.  What more do you need?\nThe Democratic Party needs to take a hard look in the mirror and — and change their ways.\nQ    I think they went from shock, denial, into the depression stage of grief, and now they’re in the rage stage, where I anticipate they’ll stay for four years, and if they get the chance, they’ll want to impeach him 10 times.  Do you anticipate you’ll be here in four years?  My last question.\nMR. MUSK:  I’ll — I’ll be as helpful as long as I can be helpful.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s a good question.  I mean, I was thinking about that just now.  I said, “I wonder how long he’s going to be doing it.”  You can’t get somebody like this.  He cares, and he’s brilliant, and he’s got energy.\nYou need energy, also, in addition to those other things.\nYou know, I have a lot of guys that are very smart, but they have no energy.  They want to sleep all day long.  You need a lot of energy.  He’s got a lot of energy.  He’s doing a great job.\nIf there’s any conflict, he — he will stop it.  But if he didn’t, I’d stop it.  I’d see if there’s a conflict.  I mean, we’re talking about big stuff.\nBut he’s under a pretty big microscope.\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah, seriously.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I mean, everybody is watching him.  If there’s a conflict, you’re going to be reading about it within about two minutes after the conflict.\nMR. MUSK:  Exactly.  There — there’s — the possibility of me getting away with something is 0 percent — 0.0.  I — I’m scrutinized to a ridiculous degree.\nAnd — and the other thing is that we — you know, what — what’s — you know what’s better than saying “trust — trust me” is just full transparency.  So, what we’re doing with — with the DOGE — DOGE dot — just go to DOGE.gov.  You can see every single action that’s being taken.\nAnd now –and I want to be clear, we are going to make some mistakes.  We’re not going to be perfect.  Nobody bats a thousand.  But we’re going to fix the mistakes very quickly.  That’s what matters: not that you don’t make mistakes, but that you fix the mistakes very fast.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And you’re going to ask the other side, when they talk about, “This is a constitutional crisis,” you got to a- — what are they paying for?  Where are those tax — because when you read off the list of things, it’s a big con job.  See, when they talk Constitution —\nMR. MUSK:  Totally.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — it’s a total con job.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They never talk — and I watch some of the shows —\nMR. MUSK:  It’s specifics — they avoid specifics.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, when you start talking about how did — how come they spent money on transgender here and transgender there —\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah, totally.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — and all the stuff in some country that nobody ever heard of, they don’t want to talk about it.  They just talk about, “This is a constitutional crisis.”\nQ    It shocks the conscious.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  The money is being squandered purposely — tremendous theft, tremendous kickbacks, everything — and we’re straightening it out.  And thank goodness.  I look up, and I say, “Thank you,” because I think if it went on for four more years, it would not be salvageable.  You wouldn’t be able —\nMR. MUSK:  Absolutely.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You wouldn’t be able to save it.\nQ    You believe, too, that when you were in Butler, came within a millimeter being assassinated —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    The day you endorsed him, that was that day.\nMR. MUSK:  Yes.\nQ    But you had been planning on it?\nMR. MUSK:  Yeah.\nQ    Pretty — I think everybody will never forget that iconic blood on your face.  “Fight, fight, fight.”  I actually was afra- — watching it and thought you might drop again.  You know, I didn’t know if it had hit you.  You can sometimes get up and then the blood starts to accumulate.  It was scary — pretty scary.\nMR. MUSK:  Well, I mean, th- — this is how you know someone’s true character, because everyone can say they’re brave, but the president was actually shot.  Okay?  Courage under fire.  “Fight, fight, fight,” blood streaming down the face.  That’s true courage.  You can’t fake that.\nQ    Yeah.  Thank you both.      Mr. President, thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.\nQ    Appreciate it.  Elon, thank you for your time.  Really nice to meet you.\nEND                    1:01 P.M.

    "slug": "ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies",
    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Policy and Purpose.  The Constitution vests all executive power in the President and charges him with faithfully executing the laws.  Since it would be impossible for the President to single-handedly perform all the executive business of the Federal Government, the Constitution also provides for subordinate officers to assist the President in his executive duties.  In the exercise of their often-considerable authority, these executive branch officials remain subject to the President’s ongoing supervision and control.  The President in turn is regularly elected by and accountable to the American people.  This is one of the structural safeguards, along with the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, regular elections for the Congress, and an independent judiciary whose judges are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, by which the Framers created a Government accountable to the American people.\nHowever, previous administrations have allowed so-called “independent regulatory agencies” to operate with minimal Presidential supervision.  These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people.  Moreover, these regulatory agencies have been permitted to promulgate significant regulations without review by the President.\nThese practices undermine such regulatory agencies’ accountability to the American people and prevent a unified and coherent execution of Federal law.  For the Federal Government to be truly accountable to the American people, officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people’s elected President.\nTherefore, in order to improve the administration of the executive branch and to increase regulatory officials’ accountability to the American people, it shall be the policy of the executive branch to ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch.  Moreover, all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Executive Office of the President before publication in the Federal Register.\nSec. 2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this order:\n(a)  The term “employees” shall have the meaning given that term in section 2105 of title 5, United States Code.\n(b)  The term “independent regulatory agency” shall have the meaning given that term in section 3502(5) of title 44, United States Code.  This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy.  This order shall apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System only in connection with its conduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions.\n(c)  The term “independent regulatory agency chairman” shall mean, with regard to a multi-member independent regulatory agency, the chairman of such agency, and shall mean, with regard to a single-headed independent regulatory agency, such agency’s chairman, director, or other presiding officer.\n(d)  The term “head” of an independent regulatory agency shall mean those appointed to supervise independent regulatory agencies and in whom the agencies’ authorities are generally vested, encompassing the chairman, director, or other presiding officer, and, as applicable, other members, commissioners, or similar such officials with responsibility for supervising such agencies.\nSec. 3.  OIRA Review of Agency Regulations.  (a)  Section 3(b) of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (“Regulatory Planning and Review”), as amended, is hereby amended to read as follows:\n“(b)  “Agency,” unless otherwise indicated, means any authority of the United States that is an “agency” under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), and shall also include the Federal Election Commission.  This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy.  This order shall apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System only in connection with its conduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions.”.\n(b)  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall provide guidance on implementation of this order to the heads of executive departments and agencies newly submitting regulatory actions under section 3(b) of Executive Order 12866.  Agency submissions by independent regulatory agencies under such section shall commence within the earlier of 60 days from the date of this order, or completion of such implementation guidance.\nSec. 4.  Performance Standards and Management Objectives.  The Director of OMB shall establish performance standards and management objectives for independent agency heads, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, and report periodically to the President on their performance and efficiency in attaining such standards and objectives.\nSec. 5.  Apportionments for Independent Regulatory Agencies.  The Director of OMB shall, on an ongoing basis:\n(a)  review independent regulatory agencies’ obligations for consistency with the President’s policies and priorities; and\n(b)  consult with independent regulatory agency chairmen and adjust such agencies’ apportionments by activity, function, project, or object, as necessary and appropriate, to advance the President’s policies and priorities.  Such adjustments to apportionments may prohibit independent regulatory agencies from expending appropriations on particular activities, functions, projects, or objects, so long as such restrictions are consistent with law.\nSec. 6.  Additional Consultation with the Executive Office of the President.  (a)  Subject to subsection (b), independent regulatory agency chairmen shall regularly consult with and coordinate policies and priorities with the directors of OMB, the White House Domestic Policy Council, and the White House National Economic Council.\n(b)  The heads of independent regulatory agencies shall establish a position of White House Liaison in their respective agencies.  Such position shall be in grade 15 of the General Schedule and shall be placed in Schedule C of the excepted service.\n(c)  Independent regulatory agency chairmen shall submit agency strategic plans developed pursuant to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 to the Director of OMB for clearance prior to finalization.\nSec. 7.  Rules of Conduct Guiding Federal Employees’ Interpretation of the Law. The President and the Attorney General, subject to the President’s supervision and control, shall provide authoritative interpretations of law for the executive branch.  The President and the Attorney General’s opinions on questions of law are controlling on all employees in the conduct of their official duties.  No employee of the executive branch acting in their official capacity may advance an interpretation of the law as the position of the United States that contravenes the President or the Attorney General’s opinion on a matter of law, including but not limited to the issuance of regulations, guidance, and positions advanced in litigation, unless authorized to do so by the President or in writing by the Attorney General.\nSec. 8.  General Provisions.  (a)  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\n(b)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(c)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(d)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person."

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose and Policy.  Today, many hopeful couples dream of starting a family, but as many as one in seven are unable to conceive a child.  Despite their hopes and efforts, infertility struggles can make conception difficult, turning what should be a joyful experience into an emotional and financial struggle.  My Administration recognizes the importance of family formation, and as a Nation, our public policy must make it easier for loving and longing mothers and fathers to have children.     In vitro fertilization (IVF) offers hope to men and women experiencing fertility challenges.  Americans need reliable access to IVF and more affordable treatment options, as the cost per cycle can range from $12,000 to $25,000.  Providing support, awareness, and access to affordable fertility treatments can help these families navigate their path to parenthood with hope and confidence.     Therefore, to support American families, it is the policy of my Administration to ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable.\nSec. 2.  Lowering Costs and Reducing Barriers to IVF.  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall submit to the President a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.\nSec. 3.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)  the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person."

    "content": "RESTORING DEMOCRACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN GOVERNMENT: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order ensuring that all federal agencies are accountable to the American people, as required by the Constitution. Under this Executive Order:\n- The Order notes that Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests all executive power in the President, meaning that all executive branch officials and employees are subject to his supervision.\n- Therefore, because all executive power is vested in the President, all agencies must: (1) submit draft regulations for White House review—with no carve-out for so-called independent agencies, except for the monetary policy functions of the Federal Reserve; and (2) consult with the White House on their priorities and strategic plans, and the White House will set their performance standards.\n- The Office of Management and Budget will adjust so-called independent agencies’ apportionments to ensure tax dollars are spent wisely.\n- The President and the Attorney General (subject to the President’s supervision and control) will interpret the law for the executive branch, instead of having separate agencies adopt conflicting interpretations.\nREINING IN INDEPENDENT AGENCIES: So-called independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have exercised enormous power over the American people without Presidential oversight.\n- These agencies issue rules and regulations that cost billions of dollars and implicate some of the most controversial policy matters, and they do so without the review of the democratically elected President.\n- They also spend American tax dollars and set priorities without consulting the President, while setting their own performance standards.\n- Now they will no longer impose rules on the American people without oversight or accountability.\nENSURING A GOVERNMENT THAT ANSWERS TO THE PEOPLE: This order fulfills President Trump’s promise to restore constitutional governance and accountability to the entire executive branch.\n- Executive power without responsibility has no place in our Republic. The United States was founded on the principle that the government should be accountable to the people. That is why the Founders created a single President who is alone vested with “the executive Power” and responsibility to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”\n- Voters and the President can now hold all Federal agencies—not just Cabinet departments—responsible for their decisions, as the Constitution demands.\n"

And for this same reason, we will also allow new parents to deduct major newborn expenses from their taxes, so that parents that have a beautiful baby will be able, so we’re pro family. But the IVF treatments are expensive. It’s very hard for many people to do it and to get it, but I’ve been in favor of IVF, right from the beginning.”"

    "content": "Mar-a-Lago\nPalm Beach, Florida\n(February 18, 2025)\n4:13 P.M. EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I want to thank some of the great people from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.  They’re here to take photographs, and it’s my honor to do so.  Also, the fire department, the great firefighters.  So, they’re here throughout the room, and I want to thank you very much for being here.  I’ll be with you in a little while.  We’ll do some great photos.  We have plenty of time.\nPolicemen, policewomen, and firemen, firewomen — they’re here, and we appreciate it very much.  You’ve done a fantastic job.\nOh, I think it’s very important to state that incredible things are happening in our country.  I think we’ve made more progress in three weeks than they’ve made in four years, especially with respect to the reputation of our country, and people are respecting us again as a country and as a powerful country and maybe a smart country.\nBut maybe not so smart, because when you look at some of the waste, fraud, and abuse that’s being inco- — uncovered by DOGE and the people at DOGE — these are young — often young but super brilliant people, incredible computer scientists and other things.  And they’re finding levels of fraud and waste and abuse like, I think, nobody ever thought possible.\nBut before we do that, I just want to ask Will to come over.  We’ve — I’ve just finished signing some executive orders.  And if we could start with that, Will, you might want to come up here and just explain what we did.\nThank you.\nMR. SCHARF:  Good afternoon, y’all.  A short while ago, President Trump signed three — three items.\nThe first is an executive order relating to the affordability and availability of in vitro fertilization and other fertility treatments.  These are treatments that have become unaffordable for many Americans or have been unaffordable for many Americans.  And the executive order is a directive to the Domestic Policy Council to examine ways to make IVF and other fertility treatments more affordable for more Americans.\nThe second item that we signed was a presidential memorandum imposing radical transparency requirements on government departments and agencies in keeping with President Trump and the administration’s broader commitment to governmental transparency.  What this presidential memorandum would do is require — as waste, fraud, and abuse is uncovered, as programs are canceled, and, ultimately, as taxpayer dollars are saved, this presidential memorandum would require departments and agencies to make all of the details of that freely available to the public.\nLastly, we have another executive order that President Trump signed relating to independent agencies.  This executive order would establish important oversight functions in the Office of Management and Budget and its subsidiary office, OIRA, supervising independent agencies and many of their actions and also reestablishes the long-standing norm that only the president or the attorney general can speak for the United States when stating an opinion as to what the law is.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  All right.  Thank you very much, Will.\nThat was the primary purpose of this conference to explain that they are all very important in their own way.\nFertilization — I’ve been saying that we’re going to do what we have to do, and I think the women — and families, husbands — are very appreciative of it.\nBut that was it.\nI do want to say while I’m up here, I’ve been contacted by some of the biggest companies in the world, and because of what we’re doing economically and through tariffs and taxes and incentives, they want to come back into the United States.  And we’ll be announcing various very large companies — the biggest, actually.  And they’ll be coming back, having to do with chips and having to do also with cars and lots of other things.\nWe’re going to be announcing some very, very big — very big — momentous, I think — momentous decisions are being made by companies all around the world — the biggest — and they want to come back into the U.S.\nCar plants are being canceled in other locations now because they want to build them here.  And you read about a couple — not that I want to mention names or anything — but you read about a couple of big ones in Mexico just got canceled because they’re going to be building them in the United States.  And that’s very simply because of what we’re doing with respect to taxes, tariffs, and incentives.\nAnd I think it’s a very important thing.  And you’ll be seeing this over the next — probably over the next two years, to be honest, but you’re going to see a lot of it over the next couple of weeks.  A lot of big ones are be — going to be announcing.\nAnd so, while we’re here, I guess we can take a couple of quick questions.\nGo ahead, please.  Please.\nQ    Mr. President, have you decided specifically what the auto tariff rate should be?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I probably will tell you that in — on April 2nd, but it’ll be in the neighborhood of 25 percent.\nQ    And what about semiconductors and pharmaceuticals?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’ll be 25 percent and higher, and it’ll go very substantially higher over a course of a year.  But we want to give them time to come in, because, as you know, when they come into the United States and they have their plant or factory here, there is no tariff.  So, we want to give them a little bit of a chance.\nYes, thank you.\nQ    Just following up on that.  The EU — I’m sorry.  Andrea Shalal.  The EU representative is going to be here in Washington next week — I’m sorry, tomorrow.  He’s going to be meeting with Hassett and Greer and Lutnick.\nWhat can the EU do to sort of avoid the reciprocal tariffs that you’ve talked about?  And, you know, you’ve talked a lot about the VAT.  Do you expect them to reduce that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, they did already, as I understand it, reduce their car tariff all the way down to what we have.  And a lot of that will take place, and I think some won’t do it and some will do it.\nBut the EU had a 10 percent tax on cars, and now they have a 2.5 percent tax, which is the exact same as us.  So, already we’ve saved a tremendous amount.  That would be great — if everybody would do that, then we’d all be on the same playing field.  Because essentially, what we’re doing with the tariffs is, you know, they charge us, we charge them.  Same amount.  And it’s called reciprocal, actually, and whatever they charge us, we’re charging them.\nAnd so, the EU is — you know, I appreciate that they did this, but, you know, the EU has been very unfair to us.  We have a deficit of $350 billion.  They don’t take our cars.  They don’t take our farm products.  They don’t take almost anything.  They take very little.  And we’re going to have to straighten that out, and we will.  I have no doubt about it.\nYeah, go ahead, please.\nQ    Thanks.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Can you tell us a little bit more about the Russia talks, your impression of —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    — how they went today —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\nQ    — and if you’re perhaps more confident or less confident of a deal after what happened today?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, much more confident.  They were very good.  Russia wants to do something.  They want to stop the savage barbarianism.  I mean, what’s going on over there, it’s — soldiers are being killed by the thousands on a weekly basis.  It’s ridiculous.  And they’re not American soldiers.  They’re Russian soldiers and they’re Ukrainian soldiers, largely, although a lot of Koreans have been killed, as you know — quite a bit of them have been killed.  They came over to fight, and a large portion have been wiped out.\nBut we want to end it.  It was — it’s a senseless war.  It should have never happened.  It would have never happened if I was president.  And it’s a shame to see it.\nAnd I see pictures that you don’t see, but I see pictures of fields that look hor- — just horrible.  It looks like Gettysburg.  If you see the old pictures of Gettysburg, it’s soldiers lying all over the field, body parts all over the field.  They’re all dead.  And this is going on on a — on a daily basis.  It’s a horrible thing.  Both Russia and Ukraine — they’re losing thousands and thousands of soldiers, and a lot of people have been killed too.\nI think that’s one of the things that’ll — you’ll see historically and you’ll see later on as it goes along.  I think people are going to be surprised at how many people, not only soldiers, have been killed in Ukraine.  A lot more people than you think.\nYeah, please.\nQ    President Trump, as part of a peace deal with Putin, would you be willing to consider removing all American troops from Europe?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, nobody has asked me to do that, so I don’t think we’d have to do that.  I wouldn’t want to do that.  But that question has never really come up.\nQ    Sir —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Please.\nQ    Sir, do you support stationing European peacekeeping troops in Ukraine as part of this peace deal?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  If they want to do that, that’s great.  I’m — I’m all for it.  If they want to do that, I think that’s — that’d be fine.\nQ    Even if the Russians are opposed —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I mean, I know France has mentioned it, others have mentioned it.\nQ    Even if the Russians are —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  UK has mentioned it.  But yeah, if — well, if we have a peace deal, I think having troops over there for — from the standpoint of Europe — we won’t have to put any over there, because, you know, we’re very far away, but having troops over there would be fine.  I would not object to it at all.\nWe’re talking about this now: peace.  We have either a ceasefire or a peace itself, and we’re looking to do both.  Would start off with the ceasefire.  And if they want to do that — I know France was willing to do that, and I thought that was a beautiful gesture.\nYeah, please.\nQ    Sir, do you have any message for Ukrainians who, after three years of fighting, might feel betrayed or disappointed at not having a seat at these initial talks in Saudi Arabia?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think I’m really disappointed in what’s happened.  I’ve been watching this for three years.  It’s a war that would have never happened if I was president.  And I’ve been watching these — these, you know, people being killed at levels that you’ve rarely seen — not — not even close since the Second World War, and I’m very disappointed.  I hear that, you know, they’re upset about not having a seat.  Well, they’ve had a seat for three years and a long time before that.\nThis could have been settled very easily.  Just a half — a half-baked negotiator could have settled this years ago without — I think, without the loss of much land, very little land; without the loss of any lives; and without the loss of cities that are just laying on their sides.\nYou have those magnificent golden domes that are shattered, will never be replaced.  You can’t replace them.  Thousand-year-old domes that are so beautiful.  You can’t replace that.  A whole civilization has changed because of what —\nSo, when they’re worried about not being seated, you mean somebody that should have gone in and made a deal a long time ago.  You could have made a deal.  This is one that could have made a deal.  There was no talk of this during the Trump administration.  Putin would have never, ever done it.\nAnd, by the way, we wouldn’t have had October 7th.  You know that.  We wouldn’t have had October 7th either in Israel, and we wouldn’t have that mess that’s going on over there.\nIt’s like you — we have great fire people here.  We’re putting out fires.  All over the world, we’re putting out fires.  So, that wouldn’t have happened.\nAnd you know what else wouldn’t have happened?  Inflation, because it was caused, really, by the cost of energy going through the roof because of their bad energy policies, and — and also their spending — their terrible spending, wasteful spending on the Green New Scam.  It’s a scam.  It’s a whole big scam.\nYeah, please.\nQ    Yes, sir.  I want to ask you a little closer to home.  What would it take for you to reconsider the restrictions on the Associated Press?\nAnd secondly, some of your advisers are concerned with the Associated Press’s style guide, using language and giving guidance to not use words like “illegal immigrant” or to use phrases like “gender-affirming care,” and they’re concerned about that being an encroaching amount of liberalism in the way in which the press writes about things.  Do you share those concerns?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I do think that some of the phrases that they want to use are ridiculous, and I think, frankly, they’ve become obsolete, especially in the last three weeks, because many things have happened in the last three weeks.\nAnd I didn’t know about that, but I would say that if they want to use certain phrases like that — and I guess some are okay, but many aren’t.\nBut the Associated Press just refuses to go with what the law is and what has taken place.  It’s called the Gulf of America now.  It’s not called the Gulf of Mexico any longer.  I have the right to do it, just like we have the right to do Mount McKinley, and nobody is even challenging that.  But only the Associate- — essentially, it’s primarily the Associated Press, and I don’t know what they’re doing, but I just say that we’re going to keep them out until such time as they agree that it’s the Gulf of America.  We’re very proud of this country, and we want it to be the Gulf of America.\nNow, the Associated Press, as you know, has been very, very wrong on the election, on Trump, and the treatment of Trump, and other things having to do with Trump and Republicans and conservatives.  And they’re doing us no favors, and I guess I’m not doing them any favors.  That’s the way life works.\nBut, you know, thank you for the question.  Who are you with?\nQ    Axios, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s a very good question.  (Laughs.)  Thank you.\nYes.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.  We’re hearing that Russia wants to force Ukraine to hold new elections in order to sign any kind of a peace deal.  Is that something that the U.S. would ever support?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we have a situation where we haven’t had elections in Ukraine; where we have martial law — essentially martial law in Ukraine; where the leader in Ukraine — I mean, I hate to say it, but he’s down at 4 percent approval rating; and where a country has been blown to smithereens.\nYou got — most of the cities are laying on their sides.  The buildings are collapsed.  It looks like a massive demolition site.  The whole — I mean, so many of the cities — I mean, they haven’t done it in Kyiv, because I guess they don’t want to shoot too many rockets in there.  They’ve done it 20 percent, but they haven’t done it 100 percent.  If they wanted to do it 100 percent, it would probably happen very quickly.  But you have cities that are absolutely decimated.\nAnd yeah, I would say that, you know, when they want a seat at the table, you could say, the people have to — wouldn’t the people of Ukraine have to say, like, you know, “It’s been a long time since we’ve had an election”?\nThat’s not a Russia thing.  That’s something coming from me and coming from many other countries also.\nQ    Would you be concerned about Russia putting up a puppet —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You know, Ukraine is being just — just wiped out.  Look at what’s happening to the cities.  That — there are cities, there’s not even a building standing.  It’s a massive — it’s — you talk about Gaza.  I mean, it’s — literally, these cities look like Gaza.  Actually, many have, percentage-wise, more buildings knocked down than in Gaza.\nSo, you know, people are tired of it.  People want to see something happen.\nAnd, you know, the other thing that — it’s been bothering me for a long time, because I di- — I solved the problem with NATO.  They paid hundreds of billions of dollars into the funds of NATO when I said, “You got to pay,” because the United States was paying for European countries, and then they take advantage of us on trade.\nBut I’ve seen it.  Look, we have to — they have to pay.  They have to find out, where is the money going to?  We have — I believe President Zelenskyy said last week that he doesn’t know where half of the money is that we gave him.  Well, we gave them, I believe, $350 billion, but let’s say it’s something less than that.  But it’s a — it’s a lot.\nAnd we have to equalize with Europe, because Europe has given us a — given a very much smaller percentage than that.  I think Europe has given 100 billion, and we’ve given, let’s say, 300-plus, and it’s more important for them than it is for us.  We have an ocean in between, and they don’t.\nBut where is all the money that’s been given?  Where is it going?  And nobody — I’ve never seen an accounting of it.  We give hundreds of billions of dollars.  I have — I don’t see any — any accounting.\nSo, I want to see peace.  Look, you know why I want?  Because I don’t want all these people killed anymore.  I’m looking at people that are being killed, and they’re Russian and Ukrainian people, but they’re people — doesn’t matter where they’re from on — on the whole planet.  And I think I have the power to end this war, and I think it’s going very well.\nBut today, I heard, “Oh, well, we weren’t invited.”  Well, you’ve been there for three years.  You should have ended it three years — you should have never started it.  You could have made a deal.\nI could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land — everything — almost all of the land, and no people would have been killed, and no city would have been demolished, and not one dome would have been knocked down.  But they chose not to do it that way.\nAnd President Biden, in all fairness, he doesn’t have a clue.  What he — he was so bad for this.  He was so bad, so pathetic, and so sad.\nBut with all of that being said, look, we — it is what it is.\nWhen I left, there was no chance that this could have happened, but it happened because we had incompetent leadership at many different levels.\nBut when you see what’s taken place in Ukraine, with millions of people killed, including the soldiers — millions of people killed, a big percentage of their cities knocked down to the ground.  I don’t know how anybody even lives there.\nYou know, when they say they took a poll and Zelenskyy is at 4 percent, who’s living there?  You know, I mean, people are — it’s hard to believe that people live there.  Their cities are being knocked down.\nAnd this is something that would have never happened.  And, by the way, for four years, it didn’t happen.  It was never going to happen.\nGo ahead.\nQ    Can I ask one follow-up question?  How would you counter the perception — because Russia is pushing for this, obviously; they don’t really hold true elections — that that would be a capitulation of some sort?  How would you guard against, potentially, Russia installing a puppet government?\nAnd then, finally, how would that new election have an impact on getting Zelenskyy to sign the rare earth minerals deal?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Look, you have leadership — and — and I like him personally.  He’s fine.  But I don’t care about personally.  I care about getting the job done.\nYou have leadership now that’s allowed a war to go on that should have never even happened, even without the United States.  Look, we had a president who was grossly incompetent.  He had no idea what he was doing.  He said some very stupid things, like going in for portions and all of the things.  He made a lot of bad statements.  But he’s grossly incompetent, and I think everyone knew that.\nThis is something that should have never happened — would have never happened.  And I used to discuss it with Putin.  President Putin and I would talk about Ukraine.  It was the apple of his eye, I will tell you that.  But he never — there was never a chance of him going in.\nAnd I told him, “You better not go in.  Don’t go in.  Don’t go in.”  And he understood that, and he understood it fully.  But I’m only interested — I want to see if I can save maybe millions of lives.  This could even end up in a World War III, I mean, to be honest with you.\nYou’ve been hearing — now Europe is saying, “Well, I think we’re going to go in and we’re going to go….”  All of a sudden, you’re going to end up in World War III over something that should have never happened.  And, you know, it’s a — it’s a very sad situation.\nYeah, please.\nQ    Mr. President, in a court filing, the White House said that Elon Musk is not a DOGE employee and has no authority to make decisions.  Can you clarify for us today —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, Elon Musk —\nQ    — what his exact role is there?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, yeah.  Elon is, to me, a patriot.  So, you know, you could call him an employee.  You could call him a consultant.  You could call him whatever you want.  But he’s a patriot.\nI mean, look at the kind of things — I just said, “Just write it down, just in case that question got asked.”  Right?  And which — I’m surprised it took so long, actually.\nBut you know what?  Ukraine is a bigger deal, because people are dying by the thousands a week — thousands.  But look at this.  From 90 to 99, Social Security: 6,054,000 people.  Well, that’s okay.  Maybe that’s possible.  You know, 90 to ninety- — 99.  Maybe it’s possible.  It’s a lot of people, though, with that.\nBut people that live to 100 to 109: 4,734,000.  Wow, that’s a lot.  That means over 100 years old.  There are 4 million people.  I don’t know — I don’t know too many.  I know people that are doing great in their 90s, but not too many people over 100.  But over 120 — from 120 years old — people that are 120 years old, up to 129: 3,472,000 people.  Wow.\nYou know that can’t possibly be because the record is like — I think it’s one person — a woman lived to 127.  But they have 3,472-.  Okay.\nBut now we’re going really in.  People from 130 years old to 139 years old: 3,936,000.  Wow.  I wonder if people are getting paid with all this.  I mean, are these checks — and that’s what we’re checking right now.\nPeople from 140 years old to 149 years old: 3,542,000.  A hundred and forty years old and beyond.  Now — now we’re really going because we’re looking to break the record by 25 years.\nPeople from 150 years old to 159 years old: 1,345,000.  These are in the — by the way, these are in the computer files.\nThese are — this is what they do well.  They’re super — I asked Elon, “Who are these DOGE people?”  He said they’re super brilliant computer people and they love the country.\nIt’s simple.\nQ    Does he —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Wait a minute.  People from 160 years old to 169 years: 121,000.  So, 160-year-old people.\nA hundred and seventy to a hundred and seventy-nine thousand: six thousand oh-eighty-seven.\nBut now let’s go into the real numbers.  From 200 to 209 years old: 879 people.\nFrom 210 years old — I haven’t met any of them.  And if I did, I’d — I would bless them.  I would — I would worship the ground they walk on.  Two hundred and ten to two hundred and nineteen years: eight hundred and sixty-six.\nFrom 220 years old to 229 years old: 1,039.\nAnd then, you have two people — from 240 years old to 249 years old: one person.  And there’s one person that’s 360 years old.\nThat’s just that.  And then, where’s the money being spent?  Right?  Let’s go into that for just a second.\nFive hundred and twenty million dollars for a consultant on the environment.  It’s called Environmental, Social, and Governance, investments in Africa and mobilize private-sector resources: $520 million.  Somebody got $520 million for an environmental — sounds like an environmental study.  That’s the most —\nI’ve always been one that paid a lot of money for my environmental studies, but they — you know, I paid like $50,000 not $520 million.  Five hundred and twenty million dollars for ESG.\nTwenty-five million dollars to promote biodiversity, conservation, and promote licit livelihoods by developing socially responsible behavior in the country of Colombia.  Well, that’s nice.  Twenty-five million going to Colombia for something that nobody ever heard of.\nForty million dollars to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants.  Forty million.\nForty-two million dollars for Johns Hopkins — great place — to research and drive social and behavior change in Uganda.  Forty-two million.  What about us?  What about social change in our country?\nSeventy million dollars for a center at Purdue to research university-sourced, evidence-based solutions to developmental challenges.  I mean, these are massive numbers on things that nobody ever heard about.\nTen million dollars for Mozambique voluntary medical male circumcisions.  Ten million dollars for circumcisions in another country.\n$9.7 million for UC Berkeley to develop a cohort of Cambodian youth with enterprise-driven skills.  In other words, let’s teach them something about enterprise.  What about our people?  Can’t we teach them about enterprise?\n$2.3 million for strengthening independent voices in Cambodia.\nThirty-two million dollars to the Prague Civil Society Centre, which is a very liberal group of people.  I wonder how much of that money came back to the people that approved it.\nFourteen million dollars for improving public procurement in Serbia.\nFour hundred eighty-six million dollars to the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening, including twenty-two million dollars for inclusive and participatory political process in Moldova.\nAnd $21 million for voter turnout in India.  Well, why are we giving $21 million to India?  They got a lot of money.  They’re the h- — one of the highest taxing countries in the world in terms of us.  We can hardly get in there because their tariffs are so high.  I have a lot of respect for India.  I have a lot of respect for the prime minister.  He just left, as you know, two days ago.  But we’re giving $21 million for voter turnout.  It’s voter turnout in India.  What about, like, voter turnout here?  Oh, we’ve done that, I guess.  We did $500 million, didn’t we?  It’s called the lockboxes.\nQ    But closer to home —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Twenty million dollars for fiscal federalism in Nepal.\nListen to these numbers.  These are — this is all fraud.\nNineteen million dollars for biodiversity conservation in Nepal.\n$1.5 million for voter confidence — we want to give them confidence — in Liberia.\nFourteen million dollars for social cohesion in Mali.\n$2.5 million for inclusive democracies in South Africa.\nForty-seven million dollars for improving learning outcomes in Asia.  Asia is doing very well.  They’re doing a lot better than we do in the schools, aren’t they?\nTwo million dollars to develop sustainable recycling models to increase socioeconomic cohesion among marginalized communities in Kosovo and Ashkali and in Egypt.\nWe’re talking about hundreds of billions of dollars.  I could — I could — by the way, I could read this all day long.  I could go on all day long, and you’ll see hundreds of billions of dollars.  And we’re doing it.\nBut when I saw the Social Security numbers, I said, “Wow, that’s really something.”  So, we have — let’s just go above 100 years old.  We have millions and millions of people over 100 years old.  Everybody knows that’s not so.\nWe have a very corrupt country — a very corrupt country.  And it’s a sad thing to say, but we’re figuring it out.\nNow, the good thing about Social Security and what I read is if you take all of those numbers off, because they’re obviously fraudulent or incompetent — but if you take all of those millions of people off Social Security, all of a sudden, we have a very powerful Social Security with people that are 80 and 70 and 90, but not 200 years old.  You know, so it’s a very positive thing.\nHow about over here?  Yeah, please.\nQ    Your reaction to Michelle King, the head, resigning after the DOGE investigation?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Who resigned?\nQ    The head of Social Security.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know.  I mean, I — resigned or got fired?  I think got fired.  You know, when you fire somebody, they always resign, and then they say, “We resigned.”  But when you have numbers like that, I think, really, it’s “Got fired.”  They have to get fired.  Who would — who would keep them?  How could you have numbers like this?\nNow, the big thing is, how many of these people got paid?  Were they getting paid?  Were they getting paid?  How many of them were getting paid Social Security?  Because that’s — if that’s the case, it’s a massive fraud.\nWe’ll have to call those great Palm Beach police into this situation, right?  You guys would figure that out very quickly.\nBut how many of them are being paid?  I mean, maybe millions of them, but it’s a total fraud.\nAlso, a lot of illegal immigrants are on Social Security that shouldn’t be there.\nYeah, please.  Go ahead.\nQ    Mr. President, there was a big wave of probationary federal workers who were fired over the weekend.  Some of these workers focused on nuclear weapons security were immediately rehired.  Do you have any concerns about how these terminations have played out?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, not at all.  I think we have to just do what we have to do.  It’s — you know, you’re going to\n— it’s amazing what’s been found right now.  It’s amazing.\nYeah, some — if we feel that — in some cases, they’ll fire people and then they’ll put some people back — not all of them, because a lot of people were let go.\nDon’t forget, I got elected on the basis of making our government stronger and smaller, because we have millions of people that — obviously, they’re paying millions of people that shouldn’t be paid.  And that has also to do with workers.\nYeah, please.  No, go ahead.  Axios, New York Times.\nQ    Sorry.\nMr. President, given your concerns about corruption, you said that if there were any conflicts of interest with Elon Musk, you wouldn’t —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    — let him anywhere near it.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.\nQ    DOGE and SpaceX employees are now working directly at the Federal Aviation Administration and the Defense Department — agencies that have billions of dollars in contracts with Musk’s companies, or that directly regulate —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    — his companies.  How is that not a conflict of interest?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I mean, I’m just hearing about it, and if there is — and he told me before I told him, but obviously, I will not let there be any conflict of interest.\nHe’s done an amazing job.  They’ve revealed — in fact, he’s going to be on tonight a big show called “Sean Hannity” at 9 o’clock, and he’s on and I’m on, and we talk about a lot of different things.\nAnd any conflicts — I told Elon, any conflicts, you can’t have anything to do with that.  So, anything to do with possibly even space, we won’t let Elon partake in that.\nYeah.  Please.\nQ    On immigration, sir.  You said you would be sending the worst of the worst to Guantanamo Bay.  What we’re finding out is that there are a lot of low-risk migrants who don’t have a criminal background who are also being sent.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    Are you thinking about this differently now about who is being sent?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, they’re going to be brought back to their countries.  And with some persuasion, every one of those countries — every one in the — as you know, every country is taking the people back.  So, some of them are going to be brought back to — many of them — any of them that are low-risk, as you say, are going to be brought back to their countries.\nQ    But why hold them in Guantanamo?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, go ahead, please.\nQ    Can you give us a bit of an update on where you stand with Venezuela?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Sure.\nQ    Its oil — there are — there is, basically, a monthly license that can soon ex- — extend to a six-month license.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, we had Venezuela on the run, and it looked like that was going to be very good.  And when Biden came in, as he always does, he screws it up.  And they started buying millions and millions and millions of dollars of oil — billions of dollars, actually, of oil.  And it gave them a new lic- — a new, really, lease on life.\nAnd — but we’ll see.  We had some pretty good discussions with a lot of people within our government — in the United States government that are involved in that.  And Venezuela is a little bit early.  But, you know, we were not buying from Venezuela.\nWhen Biden came in, for whatever reason, instead of just taking the beautiful, as I call it, liquid gold — we have more than anybody — they started paying a fortune to Venezuela.  And we’re looking at that actually.  Why did they do that?  Why were they doing that?  Why would they go to the enemy and give them billions and billions of dollars?\nNow, with that being said, as you know, Venezuela has said very strongly, they will not take any — any illegal immigrant, any of the people that they sent over to us.  They sent their gangs, probably the worst gang anywhere in the world — as bad as MS-13, maybe worse — and they came out of the jails of Venezuela.  They emptied their jails into our country, and they said, “We’ll never take them back.”  Well, they took them back, and they’re taking them back, and they are taking them back rapidly.  They were sending a lot of people to Venezuela.  They said they wouldn’t take them back, and they are taking back.\nBut we’re looking at Venezuela very seriously, and we’re going to be able — don’t forget, I’ve only been here for three weeks.\nQ    If I could just a follow-up, if you don’t mind.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, please.\nQ    Just a little clarity on: Are you inclined to continue to allow Venezuela, through, I think, Chevron and other oil companies, to export those petroleum products, or are you —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Maybe not.\nQ    — inclined to pullback on that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, maybe not.  We’re looking at that now.  I just got here.  When I was — when I left, they weren’t doing anything.  They were ready to go, “We give up.”  And then Biden came along, and he gave them — literally billions of dollars.  I couldn’t believe it, actually.\nAnd we have so much under our feet — liquid gold.  We have so much.  And it was pretty amazing.  So, we’re looking at the whole situation, why he did it.\nAll right, how about one more?  Yeah, please.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.  What can you tell us about the CIA drone flights over Mexico?  Is this the next step in the war against the cartels?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re going to see.\nQ    Should they have authority —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    — to take lethal action?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Mexico has allowed a tremendous number of people to go through their country into ours, and even people coming from Mexico, and illegals — totally illegal.  They’ve allowed people to empty jails into Mexico and then let them come through with this totally ridiculous open-border policy of the Biden administration.\nSo, millions of people have come in, and hundreds of thousands and, actually, millions are criminals.  They came in from jails all over the world that release them into Mexico, and they come into our country.\nAnd they also came in from Canada, by the way — large numbers through Canada.  In fact, when — when we closed up the one border, they came in through the other border.  So, Canada was — is not a — an uninterested party.\nBut I will say this.  We’re dealing with Mexico.  I have a very good relationship with Mexico.  But I think Mexico is largely run by the cartels, and that’s a sad thing to say.  And if they wanted help with that, we’d give them help.\nBut Mexico — if you look at what’s gone on with Mexico for years now, but now, especially, it’s run by the cartels.  And they’ve allowed millions of people to come into our country from jails and prisons of other countries, from all over the world — not just South America — Africa, Asia, all over — a lot from the Congo in Africa — a lot.  They opened their jails.  They came in through Mexico, and we have some of the worst criminals coming in from the Congo and other places.  So, it’s not just South America and it’s not just Venezuela.  But they opened their jails.\nAnd, you know, the crime rates in Venezuela and other places all over the world has gone way down.  You know why? Because they’ve given us their prisoners.  They’ve — given us their drug lords and their gang members.\nAnd it’s hard to believe that we accepted this.  It’s hard to believe that we allowed open borders, and we’re taking in, you know, hundreds of thousands and millions of people coming in from all over the world that are absolute stone-cold criminals.  In fact, 11,088 murderers, and many of those people have co- — have murdered more than one person.\nWhy are they giving us these people?  And why are we taking these people?\nUnder Biden, you know, you had a border czar that never went to the border — happened to be a vice president — never went to the border, never called the border people.\nI call them all the time.  I speak to them all the time.\nBut here’s the good news, we have the most secure border we’ve ever had right now — as secure and even more secure than I had it four years ago.  And the Border Patrol is doing incredible.  ICE is doing incredible.  Tom Homan is unbelievable.  And Kristi Noem has been just working very, very hard — very, very hard.\nAnd we have the best numbers we’ve ever had, and we’re going to keep it that way.  And we’re going to find out how a thing like this could have happened to our country, because who would allow this to happen?  What they’ve done to our country is so sad.\nThank you very much.  Thank you.\nQ    Will you still be meeting with President Putin before the end of the month?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, probably.  Probably.\nEND                    4:49 P.M.

Trump’s return to office and immediate crackdown.\nCall it the Trump Effect.\nAccording to newly released data from Customs and Border Protection (CBP), just 61,465 illegal aliens were apprehended at the southern border during the entire month of January — a 36% decline from the previous month. That number includes 29,116 apprehended along the border — the lowest since May 2020 — and 32,349 at ports of entry.\nAfter President Trump took office, apprehensions declined even more rapidly: “From Jan. 21 through Jan. 31, the number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions along the southwest border dropped 85% from the same period in 2024, according to data obtained by ABC News. In the 11 days after Jan. 20, migrants apprehended at ports of entry declined by 93%.”\nDuring the previous administration, the average number of illegal aliens encountered at the southern border in January was 141,710 — the result of dangerous policies that ferried illegal aliens directly into our communities, where they were allowed to stay indefinitely.\nNow, under President Trump, illegal border crossings are at record lows as illegal aliens are promptly arrested and sent home."

and watch it, I guess — or some of you will.  And others will try and create peace throughout the world.     Do you have any questions, please?\nQ    Sir, did you speak to Secretary Rubio this morning?     THE PRESIDENT:  I did.     Q    What is the latest with the negotiations in Saudi Arabia?  What’s he taki- —     THE PRESIDENT:  We’re moving along.  We’re trying to get a peace with Russia-Ukraine, and we’re working very hard on it.  It’s a war that should have never started.     Q    Do you expect Zelenskyy to be involved in these conversations?  What will his role be?     THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I do.  I do.  He will be involved, yes.     Q    Mr. President, would you allow the Europeans to buy U.S.-made weapons for Ukrainians?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I would.     Q    Sir, Zelenskyy said today that Russia is going to wage war on NATO.  Do you — do you agree with that?  Do you have any concerns about —     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I don’t agree.  I don’t agree with that.  Not even a little bit.\nQ    Vice President Vance said that the United States would potentially take military action against Russia if they won’t come to an agreement.  Do you agree with that stance?     THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know if that’s what he said.  I don’t think he said that.     Q    Sir, based on your conversations — based on your conversations with President Putin, what do you think he wants, ultimately, in Ukraine?     THE PRESIDENT:  I think he wants to stop fighting.  I see that.  We spoke long and hard.  Steve Witkoff was with him for a very extended period, like about three hours.  I think he wants to stop fighting.     They have a big, powerful machine.  You understand that.  And they defeated Hitler, and they defeated Napoleon.  You know, they’ve been fighting a long time.  They’ve done it before and — but I think he would like to stop fighting.     Q    Do you think he wants the whole of Ukraine, or just a pa- — like, what do you think he wants in terms territory?     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I think he wants to stop.  That was my question to him.  Because if he’s going to go on, that would have been a big problem for us, and that would have caused me a big problem, because you just can’t let that happen.      I think he wants to end it, and they want to end it fast — both of them.  And Zelenskyy wants to end it too.     Q    Sir, when do you think that could actually happen?  When do you think the fighting can stop?     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re working to get it done.  I mean, you know, it’s too bad it started.  It would have been a lot easier to end it before it started.  Right?  But it started because we had an incompetent president that — he didn’t know what he was doing.  That should have never started.     That war was so easy to stop.  Remember this: that under Bush, they took a lot.  Under Obama, they took a lot.  Under Biden, they’re trying to take the whole thing.  And under Trump, they took nothing — nothing.  Nothing was gone, not even a little bit.  So, it’s too bad.  It’s really too bad.      A lot of people are dead right now that should be alive, and a lot of cities are destroyed that can never come back like they were.  Those beautiful golden domes and all of the multi-colored domes that were 1,000 years old, they’re all laying in — you know, just shattered.  So, it’s very sad.  They ruined a culture.\nQ    They’re beginning phase two — they’re beginning phase two of the ceasefire deal —     THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.     Q    — between Israel and Hama- — Hamas.  What is — what’s going on there?  Have you been briefed on the latest relating to that?     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I told you — I have been briefed.  I told Bibi, “You do whatever you want.”  Because, you know, my statement was, “They got to come back now.”  The reason I made that statement: because they said they weren’t going to deliver — they were not going to deliver the people that they said they were going to deliver, that they agreed to deliver.  And they did agree to do that, but they broke that agreement.  When I made the statement, they delivered everybody, plus an American.     Now, the good news is, they look like they’re in pretty good shape, because the people from the week before didn’t look like they were in good shape.  They looked like Holocaust survivors, frankly — horrible.  Whatever happened to them was horrible.         But that will be up to Israel what the next step is, in consultation with me.     Q    Sir, what would the — what are they supposed to use these weapons for that you’ve now allowed to be shipped?  Given the fact that there’s a ceasefire supposed to be in effect, why ship those big bombs now?     THE PRESIDENT:  Peace through strength.  You understand that, right?  It’s called peace through strength.  You know, they contracted for those weapons a long time ago, in the Biden administration, and then Biden wouldn’t deliver the weapons.     But I look at it differently.  I say “peace through strength.”  They were sitting there.  Nobody knew what to do with them.  They bought them.  But I believe in that very strongly.     Q    On the EU —     Q    Sir, do you have an update on your —     Q    Sir, on the EU.  The — the European Union is talking about banning food imports from the U.S., kind of along the lines of your reciprocal tariffs.     THE PRESIDENT:  Why is that?  Why?     Q    They says it’s like the reciprocal tariffs.  They don’t like the (inaudible) —     THE PRESIDENT:  That’s all right.  I don’t mind.  Let them do it.  Let them do it.  They’re just hurting themselves if they do that.  I can’t imagine it, but doesn’t matter.     We’re having reciprocal tariffs.  Whatever they charge, we charge.  Very simple.     If a certain country, like India, which is very high tariff — if they charge us X dollars, we charge them X dollars.  It’s all right.  It’s a fair — it’s a fair thing to do.  Even the media said it was fair.  And it’s going to be very good for the United States.     Q    Do you have an update on your timing of your meeting with Putin in Saudi Arabia?     THE PRESIDENT:  No, we — there’s no time set, but it could be very soon.     Q    Like this — this month or —     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it’ll be soon.  We’ll see what happens.  But they’re meeting right now, and that’s more — I mean, this should have been done four years ago — three years ago, before it started.  But it should have been done immediately after it started, as opposed to now, three years later.     Q    Sir, egg prices have reached an all-time high.  What’s your administra- —     THE PRESIDENT:  Which is?  What?     Q    Egg prices have reached an all-time high.     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there’s the flu.  And it was a long — before I ever got here, it was at an all-time — this didn’t st- — remember, I’ve been here for three weeks.  And when you saw the inflation numbers, I’ve been here for three weeks.  I have had nothing to do with inflation.  This was caused by Biden.         I had four years of virtually no inflation.  So, I’m just taking over.     But I’ll tell you what, this country has made more progress in the last three weeks than it’s made in the last four years, and we’re respected again as a country.     Thank you very much.  Thank you.                              END                    4:07 P.M.

Anthony was fiercely devoted to the principle that every American, regardless of race or sex, is born with the God-given right to enjoy the blessings of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. Years later, her fearless crusade for Equality culminated in the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution, which blocked states from denying citizens the right to vote on the basis of sex. Throughout her storied life, she also emerged as a champion of the abolitionist movement and a tireless advocate for the sanctity of life.\nAs President, I have already taken historic action to advance the sacred causes that Susan B. Anthony cherished so deeply. I was honored to sign an Executive Order safeguarding women’s sports—ensuring the survival of free and competitive spaces for female athletes. Additionally, I was proud to order the end of taxpayer-funded abortion—a big win for the most vulnerable among us.\nWhile my Administration continues to honor the legacy of Susan B. Anthony and promote our shared cause of Liberty and Justice for all, I also want to thank our Nation’s First Lady, Melania Trump, for previously hosting a White House celebration with America’s youth to honor the centennial anniversary of the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. I know she looks forward to continuing to help empower and support girls and women in the United States and around the globe.\nToday, Melania joins me in paying tribute to Susan B. Anthony’s perseverance, leadership, and monumental achievements. Let us continue her life’s work of creating a culture that celebrates the enduring triumph of Freedom, the dignity of life, and the full glory of the American promise."

    "content": "POSITIONING AMERICAN ENERGY FOR THE NEXT CENTURY: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order establishing the National Energy Dominance Council.\n- The National Energy Dominance Council will be established within the Executive Office of the President, chaired by the Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and vice-chaired by the Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and comprised of members of President Trump’s cabinet and key government agencies.\n- The Council will advise President Trump on strategies to achieve energy dominance by improving the processes for permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, and transportation across all forms of American energy.\n- It will recommend a National Energy Dominance Strategy to the President aimed at cutting red tape, enhancing private sector investments, and advancing innovation.\n- The Council will facilitate cooperation between the federal government and domestic energy partners, ensuring policy consistency.\n- It will also consult with various public and private sector stakeholders to expand energy production and address cost barriers.\nLOWERING PRICES AND STRENGTHENING AMERICAN ECONOMIC SECURITY: Championing domestic energy production is vital both for mitigating price shocks to American families and de-risking the energy supply chain for our Nation as well as our allies.\n- American energy dominance is the most reliable way to ensure the stability and affordability of American energy prices.Gasoline prices, as well as overall household energy prices, increased 30% under President Biden.The Biden-Harris Administration dramatically slowed the growth rate of American energy production and development, including by instituting a federal oil leasing moratorium, increasing energy permitting times by multiples of what they had been under President Trump, and removing hundreds of million acres from being available for energy production.\n\nOver the last four years, it is estimated that our Nation produced over two billion fewer barrels of oil than anticipated by trend (had President Trump’s energy policies been kept intact), a vast quantity of lost supply that could have lessened the burden of energy prices on American families.\n- Gasoline prices, as well as

kept intact), a vast quantity of lost supply that could have lessened the burden of energy prices on American families.\n- Developing American energy resources will enable our Nation to reduce its reliance on foreign entities, including strategic adversaries.While creating policies to restrict American production, the Biden Administration asked OPEC+ to increase production to meet American energy demand.As energy prices rose, the Biden Administration was reluctant to enforce American oil sanctions on rogue regimes, allowing Iran to export over one million barrels of oil per day through lax enforcement (up from a low of approximately 70,000 under the Trump administration) and temporarily lifting oil sanctions altogether on the Maduro regime in Venezuela.The United States is also highly dependent on China for a range of critical minerals, which has put our Nation’s supply chain at risk, as exemplified by China’s recent weaponization of its resources through bans on exporting germanium, gallium, and antimony to the United States.\n\nAs our Nation makes rapid advancements in next generation technologies, such as artificial intelligence (along with the associated data centers), and energy demand rises, it will be all the more important to expand domestic energy supply.\n- While creating policies to restrict American production, the Biden Administration asked OPEC+

our Nation’s economic and national security, but also for the security of our allies.America’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry has played a critical role in helping Europe reduce its dependence on Russian energy, with LNG exports to Europe rising 141% in 2022, and continuing to increase to fill the gap.\n\nPresident Trump warned Western Europe as early as 2017 to rely on American natural gas

ENERGY DOMINANCE: President Trump has a demonstrated track record of empowering American energy production, and will return our Nation to energy dominance.\n- During President Trump’s first term, our Nation became a net exporter of energy for the first time in nearly 70 years and transformed into the world’s leading oil producer.\n- President Trump expedited the LNG export license process (achieving licensing times one-sixth as long as those seen during the Biden Administration, which revoked these reforms), reduced the permitting time for drilling on federal lands (increasing permit applications by 300%), fixed the New Source Review (which punished companies for repairing and upgrading coal power plants), and opened up millions of acres for domestic energy development.\n- Under President Trump’s leadership, American families saved an average of $2,500 per year in utility and gas costs, while the economy at large saw the creation of new American energy jobs."

    "content": "Today, President Donald J. Trump unveiled a plan for fair, free, reciprocal trade as he makes clear to the world that the United States will no longer tolerate being ripped off. The U.S. has one of the most open economies in the world, yet our trading partners keep their markets closed to U.S. exports — and reciprocal trade will finally correct that imbalance.\nPresident Trump’s plan to restore fairness and put American workers first was met with immediate praise:\nRenewable Fuels Association: “For almost a decade now, we have spent precious time and resources fighting back against an unfair and unjustified tariff regime imposed by Brazil’s government on U.S. ethanol imports. What’s more ironic is that these tariff barriers have been erected against U.S. ethanol imports while our country has openly accepted—and even encouraged and incentivized—ethanol imports from Brazil. As the two largest ethanol producers on the planet, we long enjoyed a cooperative free-trade relationship with Brazil involving ethanol, relying on each other when there were shortfalls or disruptions in the U.S. or Brazilian marketplace. However, that bilateral cooperation was abandoned by Brazil in 2017, when they instituted a tariff rate quota scheme, and eventually adopted a tariff in 2020. The Brazilian tariff on U.S. ethanol now stands at 18 percent and has virtually eliminated all market access for U.S. ethanol producers. We thank President Trump for taking this action and hope this reciprocal tariff will help encourage a return to free and fair ethanol trade relationship with Brazil.”\nAmerican Iron and Steel Institute: “AISI applauds President Trump’s action today ordering the development of a comprehensive plan for restoring fairness in U.S. trade relationships and countering non-reciprocal trading arrangements. American steel producers know well the negative impact of foreign unfair trade practices, including subsidies, currency manipulation and other unfair and discriminatory policies and practices, on domestic industries and their workers … We look forward to working with the Secretary of Commerce, the U.S. Trade Representative and other key administration officials as they develop their plan of action to ensure reciprocity in international trade and to preserve the competitiveness of the American steel industry and other sectors.”\nGrowth Energy: “While American biofuel producers have been almost entirely blocked off from the Brazilian market, Brazilian producers have enjoyed unfettered access to the U.S. In some cases, certain policies in the U.S. even incentivize the use of imported Brazilian ethanol instead of ethanol produced here in the U.S. This runs contrary to putting America first, and is exactly why President Trump is taking steps to address this issue. Thank you, President Trump for taking action and pushing for a level playing field for American ethanol producers.”\nSmall Business Administration: “President Trump is right: restoring a level playing field on trade will unlock the next blue collar boom – creating jobs and powering our economy through ‘Made in America.’ Huge news for Main Street!”\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright: “President’s Trump’s ‘Fair and Reciprocal Plan’ on trade puts the American people first. As a former businessman, it’s great to see our country being run like a business and fighting for fairness on trade– it’s the American way!”\nSecretary of the Interior Doug Burgum: “President Trump is making America strong again. His Fair and Reciprocal Plan is commonsense: if you impose tariffs on us, we will impose tariffs on you in return.”\nSecretary of Transportation Sean Duffy: “Bravo, President Trump! Thank you for announcing the Fair and Reciprocal Plan, which is based on legislation we worked on together in your first term. Unfair trade practices have hurt America’s transportation and infrastructure sectors for too long. President Trump’s trade plan will strengthen supply chains, boost infrastructure investments, and expand American transportation solutions. We promised a golden age of transportation, and I will not rest until America’s transportation system is great again!”\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development Scott Turner: “For too long Washington has put foreign interests above Americans — that ends today. @POTUS’ Fair and Reciprocal Plan will put American workers on a level playing field.”\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin: “The American people elected @POTUS with a mandate to grow our economy and bring back American manufacturing. When it comes to Reciprocal tariffs, no one should ever underestimate President Trump’s vision, long game, and determination to deliver the Great American Comeback.”\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-LA): “For too long, foreign countries have exploited America through unfair trade practices. President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs aim to confront these countries, protecting American workers and businesses through trade that is fair again. The Trump policies are focused on leveling the playing field and putting America FIRST.”\nSen. Jim Banks (R-IN): “The globalist approach to trade threw our workers under a bus driven by their foreign competitors. President Trump’s America First trade plan corrects this injustice that our industries and workers have faced for decades. The reciprocal tariffs announced today will bring back fairness and prosperity and stop Americans from being taken advantage of.”\nSen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN): “President Trump is putting American workers and farmers first. He will end unfair trade deals and prioritize goods made in America! With President Trump at the negotiating table, we are going to get the best possible deal.”\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC): “Most countries charge us far more in tariffs than we charge them. Those days are over. I applaud President Trump’s decision to impose reciprocal tariffs against our trading partners. Whatever tariffs they put on American products, we will put on their products. This will be a game changer. Simple and brilliant.”\nSen. Roger Marshall (R-KS): “Gone are the days of unfair trade deals that give foreign nations the upper hand. Today, President Trump put the world on notice: America will no longer be taken advantage of.”\nSen. Pete Ricketts (R-NE): “The average weighted tariff on foreign products coming into the U.S. is 1.5%, yet the average tariff on U.S. products globally is 6%. President Trump promised to bring those numbers closer to balance. These tariffs are a step toward accomplishing that goal.”\nSen. Rick Scott (R-FL): “President Trump’s fight for a level playing field and reciprocal treatment is common sense. The U.S. is done treating others better than they’re treating us. President Trump understands the art of the deal, and thanks to his strong leadership, we’re getting better deals that will help our businesses and grow our economy!”\nSen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL): “President Trump is brokering deals that put American farmers, manufacturers, and producers first. America has some of the best and brightest manufacturers and there’s no reason we can’t produce most things right here at home.”\nMajority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN): “The master negotiator strikes again. @POTUS is realigning the playing field with countries that have taken advantage of us for far too long and delivering on his promise to put America FIRST.”\nChairwoman Lisa McClain (R-MI): “President Trump is wasting no time leveling the playing field. I am optimistic the pressure applied by the ongoing tariff negotiations will lead to a wave of investment across the U.S. @POTUS is keeping his promise to put our economy first.”\nWays and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-MO): “President Trump understands that American workers and manufacturers can outcompete those of any other nation. But for far too long they have been held back by a lack of reciprocity because other countries impose much higher tariffs and other barriers than the United States imposes on imports. President Trump’s Executive Order helps deliver a level playing field for American workers and manufacturers.”\nRep. Carlos Gimenez (R-FL): “President Trump has just announced RECIPROCAL TARIFFS for countries unfairly treating American products! If you want to sell to the USA, we must have access to your market as well. What is fair, is fair!”\nRep. Byron Donalds (R-FL): “We will no longer tolerate being ripped-off by the rest of the world. Under President Trump, government is putting the American people first again. And that means RECIPROCAL TARIFFS”\nRep. Randy Feenstra (R-IA): “Brazil imposes an 18% tariff on U.S. ethanol while we only charge Brazil 2.5%. In 2024, that imbalance resulted in our nation importing $200 million in Brazilian ethanol while Brazil only imported $52 million in U.S. ethanol. Our farmers deserve better!”\nRep. Andy Harris (R-MD): “The days of America being taken advantage of are over. The “Fair and Reciprocal Plan” will put the American worker first and bring fairness back to international trade.”\nRep. Diana Harshbarger (R-TN): “Our nation has been at the bad end of business deals regarding trade practices with other countries for far too long. That’s coming to an end. President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs are putting the world on notice — the gravy train is over, and we won’t be taken advantage of anymore.”\nRep. Kevin Hern (R-OK): “President Trump is a strong leader – he’s not allowing the world to take advantage of the United States any longer. These reciprocal tariffs will incentivize other nations to level the playing field and remove long-standing, exorbitant tariffs. America FIRST!”\nRep. Riley Moore (R-WV): “President Trump just announced plans to implement reciprocal tariffs on the foreign countries who are ripping us off. I’m proud to be leading this effort in Congress.”\nRep. Greg Steube (R-FL): “I thank President Trump for standing up for American workers with his bold plan to restore balance and fairness to the marketplace. He and his administration understand that our workers deserve trade policies that are fair and beneficial to all.  For far too long, blue-collar communities in the United States have been ripped off by foreign competitors benefiting from manipulative trade practices. If other countries believe they can continue to cheat the American people of their share of prosperity, they are sadly mistaken. President Trump has the right plan to secure our economy, restore fairness to international trade, and bring back good-paying jobs to the United States.”\nRep. Beth Van Duyne (R-TX): “American workers, farmers, and manufacturers finally have a President who fights for them! I applaud President Trump’s plan to combat unfair trade practices. Our best days are still ahead of us!”\nHouse Republican Study Committee: “The Trump administration just announced reciprocal tariffs for countries like China that rip off the United States. It’s past time to flip the script on this. President Trump is trying to restore fairness in trade, ensuring that other countries are held to account for slapping tariffs on American goods. Gone are the days of our great nation being taken advantage of. Period.”\n"

    "content": "MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY\nTHE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE\nTHE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY\nTHE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nTHE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE\nTHE ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR ECONOMIC POLICY\nTHE SENIOR COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT FOR TRADE AND MANUFACTURING\nSUBJECT: Reciprocal Trade and Tariffs\nSection 1.  Background.  The United States has one of the most open economies and has among the lowest average weighted tariff rates in the world.  The United States imposes fewer barriers to imports than other major world economies, including those with similar political and economic systems.  For many years, the United States has been treated unfairly by trading partners, both friend and foe.  This lack of reciprocity is one source of our country’s large and persistent annual trade deficit in goods — closed markets abroad reduce United States exports and open markets at home result in significant imports.       Our workers and industries bear the brunt of unfair practices and limited access to foreign markets.  As noted in the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy Memorandum), this situation is untenable.  The trade deficit of the United States threatens our economic and national security, has hollowed out our industrial base, has reduced our overall national competitiveness, and has made our Nation dependent on other countries to meet our key security needs.  By making trade more reciprocal and balanced, we can reduce the trade deficit; grow the United States economy; and improve our trade relationships with trading partners to the benefit of American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses.       Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to reduce our large and persistent annual trade deficit in goods and to address other unfair and unbalanced aspects of our trade with foreign trading partners.  In pursuit of this policy, I will introduce the “Fair and Reciprocal Plan”(Plan).  Under the Plan, my Administration will work strenuously to counter non-reciprocal trading arrangements with trading partners by determining the equivalent of a reciprocal tariff with respect to each foreign trading partner.  This approach will be of comprehensive scope, examining non-reciprocal trade relationships with all United States trading partners, including any:      (a)  tariffs imposed on United States products;      (b)  unfair, discriminatory, or extraterritorial taxes imposed by our trading partners on United States businesses, workers, and consumers, including a value-added tax;      (c)  costs to United States businesses, workers, and consumers arising from nontariff barriers or measures and unfair or harmful acts, policies, or practices, including subsidies, and burdensome regulatory requirements on United States businesses operating in other countries;      (d)  policies and practices that cause exchange rates to deviate from their market value, to the detriment of Americans; wage suppression; and other mercantilist policies that make United States businesses and workers less competitive; and       (e)  any other practice that, in the judgment of the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Senior Counselor to the President for Trade and Manufacturing, imposes any unfair limitation on market access or any structural impediment to fair competition with the market economy of the United States.      The Plan shall ensure comprehensive fairness and balance across the international trading system by factoring in losses as a result of measures that disadvantage the United States as applied, regardless of what they are called or whether they are written or unwritten.       Sec. 3.  Taking Action.  (a)  After the submission of the specified agency reports due under the America First Trade Policy Memorandum, the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Senior Counselor to the President for Trade and Manufacturing, and the heads of such other executive departments and agencies as the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative deem relevant, shall initiate, pursuant to their respective legal authorities, all necessary actions to investigate the harm to the United States from any non-reciprocal trade arrangements adopted by any trading partners.  Upon completion of such necessary actions, they shall submit to me a report detailing proposed remedies in pursuit of reciprocal trade relations with each trading partner.     (b)  Within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall assess all fiscal impacts on the Federal Government and the impacts of any information collection requests on the public, and shall deliver an assessment in writing to the President.     Sec. 4.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this memorandum:    (a)  “Value-added tax” means a type of consumption tax that is levied on the incremental increase in value of a good or service at each stage of the supply chain.     (b)  “Nontariff barrier” or “measure” means any government-imposed measure or policy or nonmonetary barrier that restricts, prevents, or impedes international trade in goods, including import policies, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, government procurement, export subsidies, lack of intellectual property protection, digital trade barriers, and government-tolerated anticompetitive conduct of state-owned or private firms.     Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.     (b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.     (c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.     (d)  The United States Trade Representative is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register."

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  American life expectancy significantly lags behind other developed countries, with pre‑COVID-19 United States life expectancy averaging 78.8 years and comparable countries averaging 82.6 years.  This equates to 1.25 billion fewer life years for the United States population.  Six in 10 Americans have at least one chronic disease, and four in 10 have two or more chronic diseases.  An estimated one in five United States adults lives with a mental illness.\nThese realities become even more painful when contrasted with nations around the globe.  Across 204 countries and territories, the United States had the highest age-standardized incidence rate of cancer in 2021, nearly double the next-highest rate.  Further, from 1990-2021, the United States experienced an 88 percent increase in cancer, the largest percentage increase of any country evaluated.  In 2021, asthma was more than twice as common in the United States than most of Europe, Asia, or Africa.  Autism spectrum disorders had the highest prevalence in high-income countries, including the United States, in 2021.  Similarly, autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis are more commonly diagnosed in high-income areas such as Europe and North America.  Overall, the global comparison data demonstrates that the health of Americans is on an alarming trajectory that requires immediate action.\nThis concern applies urgently to America’s children.  In 2022, an estimated 30 million children (40.7 percent) had at least one health condition, such as allergies, asthma, or an autoimmune disease.  Autism spectrum disorder now affects 1 in 36 children in the United States — a staggering increase from rates of 1 to 4 out of 10,000 children identified with the condition during the 1980s.  Eighteen percent of late adolescents and young adults have fatty liver disease, close to 30 percent of adolescents are prediabetic, and more than 40 percent of adolescents are overweight or obese.\nThese health burdens have continued to increase alongside the increased prescription of medication.  For example, in the case of Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, over 3.4 million children are now on medication for the disorder — up from 3.2 million children in 2019-2020 — and the number of children being diagnosed with the condition continues to rise.\nThis poses a dire threat to the American people and our way of life.  Seventy-seven percent of young adults do not qualify for the military based in large part on their health scores.  Ninety percent of the Nation’s $4.5 trillion in annual healthcare expenditures is for people with chronic and mental health conditions.  In short, Americans of all ages are becoming sicker, beset by illnesses that our medical system is not addressing effectively.  These trends harm us, our economy, and our security.\nTo fully address the growing health crisis in America, we must re-direct our national focus, in the public and private sectors, toward understanding and drastically lowering chronic disease rates and ending childhood chronic disease.  This includes fresh thinking on nutrition, physical activity, healthy lifestyles, over-reliance on medication and treatments, the effects of new technological habits, environmental impacts, and food and drug quality and safety.  We must restore the integrity of the scientific process by protecting expert recommendations from inappropriate influence and increasing transparency regarding existing data.  We must ensure our healthcare system promotes health rather than just managing disease.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It shall be the policy of the Federal Government to aggressively combat the critical health challenges facing our citizens, including the rising rates of mental health disorders, obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases.  To do so, executive departments and agencies (agencies) that address health or healthcare must focus on reversing chronic disease.  Under this policy:\n(a)  all federally funded health research should empower Americans through transparency and open-source data, and should avoid or eliminate conflicts of interest that skew outcomes and perpetuate distrust;\n(b)  the National Institutes of Health and other health-related research funded by the Federal Government should prioritize gold-standard research on the root causes of why Americans are getting sick;\n(c)  agencies shall work with farmers to ensure that United States food is the healthiest, most abundant, and most affordable in the world; and\n(d)  agencies shall ensure the availability of expanded treatment options and the flexibility for health insurance coverage to provide benefits that support beneficial lifestyle changes and disease prevention.\nSec. 3.  Establishment and Composition of the President’s Make America Healthy Again Commission.  (a)  There is hereby established the President’s Make America Healthy Again Commission (Commission), chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Chair), with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy serving as Executive Director (Executive Director).\n(b)  In addition to the Chair and the Executive Director, the Commission shall include the following officials, or their designees:\n(i)     the Secretary of Agriculture;\n(ii)    the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;\n(iii)   the Secretary of Education;\n(iv)    the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;\n(v)     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency;\n(vi)    the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;\n(vii)   the Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy;\n(viii)  the Director of the National Economic Council;\n(ix)    the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers;\n(x)     the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy;\n(xi)    the Commissioner of Food and Drugs;\n(xii)   the Director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;\n(xiii)  the Director of the National Institutes of Health; and\n(xiv)   other members of my Administration invited to participate, at the discretion of the Chair and the Executive Director.\nSec. 4.  Fighting Childhood Chronic Disease.  The initial mission of the Commission shall be to advise and assist the President on how best to exercise his authority to address the childhood chronic disease crisis.  Therefore, the Commission shall:\n(a)  study the scope of the childhood chronic disease crisis and any potential contributing causes, including the American diet, absorption of toxic material, medical treatments, lifestyle, environmental factors, Government policies, food production techniques, electromagnetic radiation, and corporate influence or cronyism;\n(b)  advise and assist the President on informing the American people regarding the childhood chronic disease crisis, using transparent and clear facts; and\n(c)  provide to the President Government-wide recommendations on policy and strategy related to addressing the identified contributing causes of and ending the childhood chronic disease crisis.\nSec. 5.  Initial Assessment and Strategy from the Make America Healthy Again Commission.  (a)  Make our Children Healthy Again Assessment.  Within 100 days of the date of this order, the Commission shall submit to the President, through the Chair and the Executive Director, the Make Our Children Healthy Again Assessment, which shall:\n(i)     identify and describe childhood chronic disease in America compared to other countries;\n(ii)    assess the threat that potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures pose to children with respect to chronic inflammation or other established mechanisms of disease, using rigorous and transparent data, including international comparisons;\n(iii)   assess the prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs;\n(iv)    identify and report on best practices for preventing childhood health issues, including through proper nutrition and the promotion of healthy lifestyles;\n(v)     evaluate the effectiveness of existing educational programs with regard to nutrition, physical activity, and mental health for children;\n(vi)    identify and evaluate existing Federal programs and funding intended to prevent and treat childhood health issues for their scope and effectiveness;\n(vii)   ensure transparency of all current data and unpublished analyses related to the childhood chronic disease crisis, consistent with applicable law;\n(viii)  evaluate the effectiveness of current Federal Government childhood health data and metrics, including those from the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and the National Survey of Children’s Health;\n(ix)    restore the integrity of science, including by eliminating undue industry influence, releasing findings and underlying data to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, and increasing methodological rigor; and\n(x)     establish a framework for transparency and ethics review in industry-funded projects.\n(b)  Make our Children Healthy Again Strategy.  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Commission shall submit to the President, through the Chair and the Executive Director, a Make Our Children Healthy Again Strategy (Strategy), based on the findings from the Make Our Children Healthy Again Assessment described in subsection (a) of this section.  The Strategy shall address appropriately restructuring the Federal Government’s response to the childhood chronic disease crisis, including by ending Federal practices that exacerbate the health crisis or unsuccessfully attempt to address it, and by adding powerful new solutions that will end childhood chronic disease.\n(c)  The Chair may hold public hearings, meetings, roundtables, and similar events, as appropriate, and may receive expert input from leaders in public health and Government accountability.\nSec. 6.  Additional Reports.  (a)  Following the submission to the President of the Strategy, and any final strategy reports thereafter, the Chair and the Executive Director shall recommend to the President updates to the Commission’s mission, including desired reports.\n(b)  The Commission shall not reconvene, following submission of the Strategy, until an updated mission is submitted to the President through the Executive Director.\nSec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nFebruary 13, 2025."

    "content": "The President of the United States of America, The Honorable Donald J. Trump hosted the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi for an Official Working Visit in Washington, DC on February 13, 2025.  As the leaders of sovereign and vibrant democracies that value freedom, the rule of law, human rights, and pluralism, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi reaffirmed the strength of the India-U.S. Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership, anchored in mutual trust, shared interests, goodwill and robust engagement of their citizens. Today, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi launched a new initiative – the “U.S.-India COMPACT (Catalyzing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce & Technology) for the 21st Century” – to drive transformative change across key pillars of cooperation. Under this initiative, they committed to a results-driven agenda with initial outcomes this year to demonstrate the level of trust for a mutually beneficial partnership.    Defense 1.    Highlighting the deepening convergence of U.S.-India strategic interests, the leaders reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to a dynamic defense partnership spanning multiple domains. To advance defense ties further, the leaders announced plans to sign this year a new ten-year Framework for the U.S.-India Major Defense Partnership in the 21st Century. 2.    The leaders welcomed the significant integration of U.S.-origin defense items into India’s inventory to date, including C‑130J Super Hercules, C‑17 Globemaster III, P‑8I Poseidon aircraft; CH‑47F Chinooks, MH‑60R Seahawks, and AH‑64E Apaches; Harpoon anti-ship missiles; M777 howitzers; and MQ‑9Bs.  The leaders determined that the U.S. would expand defense sales and co-production with India to strengthen interoperability and defense industrial cooperation.  They announced plans to pursue this year new procurements and co-production arrangements for “Javelin” Anti-Tank Guided Missiles and “Stryker” Infantry Combat Vehicles in India to rapidly meet India’s defense requirements. They also expect completion of procurement for six additional P-8I Maritime Patrol aircraft to enhance India’s maritime surveillance reach in the Indian Ocean Region following agreement on sale terms. 3.    Recognizing that India is a Major Defense Partner with Strategic Trade Authorization-1 (STA‑1) authorization and a key Quad partner, the U.S. and India will review their respective arms transfer regulations, including International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), in order to streamline defense trade, technology exchange and maintenance, spare supplies and in-country repair and overhaul of U.S.-provided defense systems. The leaders also called for opening negotiations this year for a Reciprocal Defense Procurement (RDP) agreement to better align their procurement systems and enable the reciprocal supply of defense goods and services. The leaders pledged to accelerate defense technology cooperation across space, air defense, missile, maritime and undersea technologies, with the U.S. announcing a review of its policy on releasing fifth generation fighters and undersea systems to India. 4.    Building on the U.S.-India Roadmap for Defense Industrial Cooperation and recognizing the rising importance of autonomous systems, the leaders announced a new initiative – the Autonomous Systems Industry Alliance (ASIA) – to scale industry partnerships and production in the Indo-Pacific.  The leaders welcomed a new partnership between Anduril Industries and Mahindra Group on advanced autonomous technologies to co-develop and co-produce state-of-the-art maritime systems and advanced AI-enabled counter Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) to strengthen regional security, and between L3 Harris and Bharat Electronics for co-development of active towed array systems. 5.    The leaders also pledged to elevate military cooperation across all domains – air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace – through enhanced training, exercises, and operations, incorporating the latest technologies.  The leaders welcomed the forthcoming “Tiger Triumph” tri-service exercise (first inaugurated in 2019) with larger scale and complexity to be hosted in India. 6.    Finally, the leaders committed to break new ground to support and sustain the overseas deployments of the U.S. and Indian militaries in the Indo-Pacific, including enhanced logistics and intelligence sharing, as well as arrangements to improve force mobility for joint humanitarian and disaster relief operations along with other exchanges and security cooperation engagements.Trade and Investment7.    The leaders resolved to expand trade and investment to make their citizens more prosperous, nations stronger, economies more innovative and supply chains more resilient.  They resolved to deepen the U.S.-India trade relationship to promote growth that ensures fairness, national security and job creation.  To this end, the leaders set a bold new goal for bilateral trade – “Mission 500” – aiming to more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.  8.    Recognizing that this level of ambition would require new, fair-trade terms, the leaders announced plans to negotiate the first tranche of a mutually beneficial, multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) by fall of 2025. The leaders committed to designate senior representatives to advance these negotiations and to ensure that the trade relationship fully reflects the aspirations of the COMPACT. To advance this innovative, wide-ranging BTA, the U.S. and India will take an integrated approach to strengthen and deepen bilateral trade across the goods and services sector, and will work towards increasing market access, reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepening supply chain integration. 9.    The leaders welcomed early steps to demonstrate mutual commitment to address bilateral trade barriers. The United States welcomed India’s recent measures to lower tariffs on U.S. products of interest in the areas of bourbon, motorcycles, ICT products and metals, as well as measures to enhance market access for U.S. agricultural products, like alfalfa hay and duck meat, and medical devices.  India also expressed appreciation for U.S. measures taken to enhance exports of Indian mangoes and pomegranates to the United States.  Both sides also pledged to collaborate to enhance bilateral trade by increasing U.S. exports of industrial goods to India and Indian exports of labor-intensive manufactured products to the United States. The two sides will also work together to increase trade in agricultural goods.10.    Finally, the leaders committed to drive opportunities for U.S. and Indian companies to make greenfield investments in high-value industries in each other’s countries.  In this regard, the leaders welcomed ongoing investments by Indian companies worth approximately $7.35 billion, such as those by Hindalco’s Novelis in finished aluminum goods at their state-of-the art facilities in Alabama and Kentucky; JSW in steel manufacturing operations at Texas and Ohio; Epsilon Advanced Materials in the manufacture of critical battery materials in North Carolina; and Jubilant Pharma in the manufacture of injectables in Washington. These investments support over 3,000 high-quality jobs for local families. Energy Security11.    The leaders agreed that energy security is fundamental to economic growth, social well-being and technical innovation in both countries. They underscored the importance of U.S.-India collaboration to ensure energy affordability, reliability, and availability and stable energy markets. Realizing the consequential role of the U.S. and India, as leading producers and consumers, in driving the global energy landscape, the leaders re-committed to the U.S.-India Energy Security Partnership, including in oil, gas, and civil nuclear energy. 12.    The leaders underscored the importance of enhancing the production of hydrocarbons to ensure better global energy prices and secure affordable and reliable energy access for their citizens. The leaders also underscored the value of strategic petroleum reserves to preserve economic stability during crises and resolved to work with key partners to expand strategic oil reserve arrangements.  In this context, the U.S. side affirmed its firm support for India to join the International Energy Agency as a full member. 13.    The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to increase energy trade, as part of efforts to ensure energy security, and to establish the United States as a leading supplier of crude oil and petroleum products and liquified natural gas to India, in line with the growing needs and priorities of our dynamic economies. They underscored the tremendous scope and opportunity to increase trade in the hydrocarbon sector including natural gas, ethane and petroleum products as part of efforts to ensure supply diversification and energy security. The leaders committed to enhance investments, particularly in oil and gas infrastructure, and facilitate greater cooperation between the energy companies of the two countries. 14.    The leaders announced their commitment to fully realize the U.S.-India 123 Civil Nuclear Agreement by moving forward with plans to work together to build U.S.-designed nuclear reactors in India through large scale localization and possible technology transfer. Both sides welcomed the recent Budget announcement by Government of India to take up amendments to the Atomic Energy Act and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA) for nuclear reactors and further decided to establish bilateral arrangements in accordance with CLNDA, that would address the issue of civil liability and facilitate the collaboration of Indian and U.S. industry in the production and deployment of nuclear reactors. This path forward will unlock plans to build large U.S.-designed reactors and enable collaboration to develop, deploy and scale up nuclear power generation with advanced small modular reactors. Technology and Innovation15.    The leaders announced the launch of the U.S.-India TRUST (“Transforming the Relationship Utilizing Strategic Technology”) initiative, which will catalyze government-to-government, academia and private sector collaboration to promote application of critical and emerging technologies in areas like defense, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum, biotechnology, energy and space, while encouraging the use of verified technology vendors and ensuring sensitive technologies are protected. 16.    As a central pillar of the “TRUST” initiative, the leaders committed to work with U.S. and Indian private industry to put forward a U.S.-India Roadmap on Accelerating AI Infrastructure by the end of the year, identifying constraints to financing, building, powering, and connecting large-scale U.S.-origin AI infrastructure in India with milestones and future actions.  The U.S. and India will work together to enable industry partnerships and investments in next generation data centers, cooperation on development and access to compute and processors for AI, for innovations in AI models and building AI applications for solving societal challenges while addressing the protections and controls necessary to protect these technologies and reduce regulatory barriers.17.    The leaders announced the launch of INDUS Innovation, a new innovation bridge modeled after the successful INDUS-X platform, that will advance U.S.-India industry and academic partnerships and foster investments in space, energy, and other emerging technologies to maintain U.S. and India leadership in innovation and to meet the needs of the 21st century.  The leaders also reinforced their commitment to the INDUS-X initiative, which facilities partnerships between U.S. and Indian defense companies, investors and universities to produce critical capability for our militaries and welcomed the next summit in 2025.  18.    The leaders also committed, as part of the TRUST initiative, to build trusted and resilient supply chains, including for semiconductors, critical minerals, advanced materials and pharmaceuticals. As part of this effort, the leaders plan to encourage public and private investments to expand Indian manufacturing capacity, including in the U.S., for active pharmaceutical ingredients for critical medicines. These investments will create good jobs, diversify vital supply chains, and reduce the risk of life-saving drug shortages in both the United States and India.19.    Recognizing the strategic importance of critical minerals for emerging technologies and advanced manufacturing, India and the United States will accelerate collaboration in research and development and promote investment across the entire critical mineral value chain, as well as through the Mineral Security Partnership, of which both the United States and India are members. Both countries have committed to intensifying efforts to deepen cooperation in the exploration, beneficiation, and processing as well as recycling technologies of critical minerals. To this end, the leaders announced the launch of the Strategic Mineral Recovery initiative, a new U.S.-India program to recover and process critical minerals (including lithium, cobalt, and rare earths) from heavy industries like aluminum, coal mining and oil and gas.20.    The leaders hailed 2025 as a pioneering year for U.S.-India civil space cooperation, with plans for a NASA-ISRO effort through AXIOM to bring the first Indian astronaut to the International Space Station (ISS), and early launch of the joint “NISAR” mission, the first of its kind to systematically map changes to the Earth’s surface using dual radars.  The leaders called for more collaboration in space exploration, including on long duration human spaceflight missions, spaceflight safety and sharing of expertise and professional exchanges in emerging areas, including planetary protection. The leaders committed to further commercial space collaboration through industry engagements in conventional and emerging areas, such as connectivity, advanced spaceflight, satellite and space launch systems, space sustainability, space tourism and advanced space manufacturing. 21.    The leaders underscored the value of deepening ties between the U.S. and Indian scientific research communities, announcing a new partnership between the U.S. National Science Foundation and the Indian Anusandhan National Research Foundation in researching critical and emerging technologies.  This partnership builds on ongoing collaboration between the U.S. National Science Foundation and several Indian science agencies to enable joint research in the areas of semiconductors, connected vehicles, machine learning, next-generation telecommunications, intelligent transportation systems, and future biomanufacturing. 22.    The leaders determined that their governments redouble efforts to address export controls, enhance high technology commerce, and reduce barriers to technology transfer between our two countries, while addressing technology security.  The leaders also resolved to work together to counter the common challenge of unfair practices in export controls by third parties seeking to exploit overconcentration of critical supply chains.  Multilateral Cooperation23.    The leaders reaffirmed that a close partnership between the U.S. and India is central to a free, open, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. As Quad partners, the leaders reiterated that this partnership is underpinned by the recognition of ASEAN centrality; adherence to international law and good governance; support for safety and freedom of navigation, overflight and other lawful uses of the seas; and unimpeded lawful commerce; and advocacy for peaceful resolution of maritime disputes in accordance with international law. 24.    Prime Minister Modi looks forward to hosting President Trump in New Delhi for the Quad leaders’ Summit, ahead of which the leaders will activate new Quad initiatives on shared airlift capacity to support civilian response to natural disasters and maritime patrols to improve interoperability.   25.    The leaders resolved to increase cooperation, enhance diplomatic consultations, and increase tangible collaboration with partners in the Middle East. They highlighted the importance of investing in critical infrastructure and economic corridors to advancing peace and security in the region.  The leaders plan to convene partners from the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor and the I2U2 Group within the next six months in order to announce new initiatives in 2025.  26.    The US appreciates India’s role as a developmental, humanitarian assistance and net security provider in the Indian Ocean Region. In this context, the leaders committed to deepen bilateral dialogue and cooperation across the vast Indian Ocean region and launched the Indian Ocean Strategic Venture, a new bilateral, whole-of-government forum to advance coordinated investments in economic connectivity and commerce. Supporting greater Indian Ocean connectivity, the leaders also welcomed Meta’s announcement of a multi-billion, multi-year investment in an undersea cable project that will begin work this year and ultimately stretch over 50,000 km to connect five continents and strengthen global digital highways in the Indian Ocean region and beyond. India intends to invest in maintenance, repair and financing of undersea cables in the Indian Ocean, using trusted vendors. 27.    The leaders recognized the need to build new plurilateral anchor partnerships in the Western Indian Ocean, Middle East, and Indo-Pacific to grow relationships, commerce and cooperation across defense, technology, energy and critical minerals.  The leaders expect to announce new partnership initiatives across these sub-regions by fall of 2025. 28.    The leaders also resolved to advance military cooperation in multinational settings to advance global peace and security. The leaders applauded India’s decision to take on a future leadership role in the Combined Maritime Forces naval task force to help secure sea lanes in the Arabian Sea.29.    The leaders reaffirmed that the global scourge of terrorism must be fought, and terrorist safe havens eliminated from every corner of the world.  They committed to strengthen cooperation against terrorist threats from groups, including Al-Qa’ida, ISIS, Jaish-e-Mohammad, and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba in order to prevent heinous acts like the attacks in Mumbai on 26/11 and the Abbey Gate bombing in Afghanistan on August 26, 2021.  Recognizing a shared desire to bring to justice those who would harm our citizens, the U.S. announced that the extradition to India of Tahawwur Rana has been approved. The leaders further called on Pakistan to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai, and Pathankot attacks and ensure that its territory is not used to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks.  The leaders also pledged to work together to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems and to deny access to such weapons by terrorists and non-state actors.People to People Cooperation30.    President Trump and Prime Minister Modi noted the importance of advancing the people-to-people ties between the two countries. In this context, they noted that the more than 300,000 strong Indian student community contributes over $8 billion annually to the U.S. economy and helped create a number of direct and indirect jobs. They recognized that the talent flow and movement of students, researchers and employees, has mutually benefitted both countries. Recognizing the importance of international academic collaborations in fostering innovation, improving learning outcomes and development of a future-ready workforce, both leaders resolved to strengthen collaborations between the higher education institutions through efforts such as joint/dual degree and twinning programs, establishing joint Centers of Excellence, and setting up of offshore campuses of premier educational institutions of the U.S. in India.31.    Both leaders emphasized that the evolution of the world into a global workplace calls for putting in place innovative, mutually advantageous and secure mobility frameworks. In this regard, the leaders committed to streamlining avenues for legal mobility of students and professionals, and facilitating short-term tourist and business travel, while also aggressively addressing illegal immigration and human trafficking by taking strong action against bad actors, criminal facilitators, and illegal immigration networks to promote mutual security for both countries.32.    The leaders also committed to strengthen law enforcement cooperation to take decisive action against illegal immigration networks, organized crime syndicates, including narco-terrorists human and arms traffickers, as well as other elements who threaten public and diplomatic safety and security, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both nations.33.    President Trump and Prime Minister Modi pledged to sustain high-level engagement between our governments, industries, and academic institutions and realize their ambitious vision for an enduring India-U.S. partnership that advances the aspirations of our people for a bright and prosperous future, serves the global good, and contributes to a free and open Indo-Pacific.\n"

KENNEDY, JR., DURING SWEARING-IN CEREMONY\nOval Office(February 13, 2025)\n2:45 P.M. EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Thank you very much.  And thank you all for being here on this very exciting — this is a very exciting day for — we just had a big tariff meeting — reciprocal tariffs.  Should have been done 40 years ago.  It wasn’t, but it is now.  It was big moment, actually, and this is a tremendous moment right now.\nAnd it’s going to be a real honor for me to introduce Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who’ll take the oath of office and officially become our secretary of Health and Human Services, just as I promised last year.\nBobby is going to lead a great national mission to make America healthy again, and he’s going to do it.  I think he’s going to do things that will really make us very proud of this day.\nLike his father, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, Bobby has devoted much of his life to serving his fellow Americans.  In his campaign for president — and he was a very tough competitor.  I did not like it at all.  (Laughter.)  I said, “Let’s get him on my side.”  (Laughter.)\nBut in his campaign for president in 2024, Bobby brought together a coalition of supporters across party lines, and he really worked very hard, and he had tremendous support, unbelievable support.  And I think a lot of that support came my way when we decided to do a little merger.\nAnd it was really great.  And it was very loyal — very loyal, incredible people.  They believe in him so strongly because he’s a fierce advocate for the health of our children and for the values of free speech, democracy, and peace.\nAnd people are going to be very impressed.  I have no doubt.  I’ve known him a long time.  He’s been a friend of mine a long time.\nPerhaps most importantly, though, Bobby created a nationwide movement made up of millions and millions of mothers and fathers and young people and concerned citizen of every background who want to end this — this horrible, chronic disease crisis that exists in America.\nHe’s absolutely committed to getting dangerous chemicals out of our environment and out of our food supply and getting the American people the facts and the answers that we deserve after years in which our public health system has squandered the trust of our citizens.  And they really have.  They don’t trust us.  They don’t trust anybody, frankly.  They’ve gone through hell.\nThere’s no better person to lead our campaign of historic reforms and restore faith in American health care, and Bobby is going to do it.\nThe United States spends more money in health than any other country on Earth, but we’re growing sicker every year.  We’re not as healthy as countries that spend just a fraction of what we spend.  So, there’s something wrong.  He’s going to figure it out.\nIn recent decades, we’ve seen staggering increases in cancer rates across all age demographics, including more than 40 percent increase in childhood cancer since 1975 — who can believe that? — and an explosion in other chronic childhood illnesses.\nNot long ago, 1 in 10,000 people — children had autism.  Now it’s 1 in 36.  Think of that, 1 in 10,000 — 1 in 10,000, and now it’s 1 in 36.  Who can believe that?  There’s something wrong.  There’s something wrong, and I think it’s something that can be found out.\nIn 2022, more than 40 percent of children had at least one chronic health condition, and today, nearly 80 percent of young adults do not qualify for military service, in large part for health reasons.  Think of that, 80 percent.  Something is wrong, and that’s why, immediately after Bobby is sworn in, I will be signing an executive order establishing the president’s commission to make America healthy again.  We have some great people on that commission.\nChaired by our new secretary, this groundbreaking commission will be charged with investigating what is causing the decades-long increase in chronic illness, reporting its findings, and delivering an action plan to the American people.  And it’s going to be a plan that people are really waiting to hear.\nBobby, I want to thank you.  You’ve gone through a lot.  It’s taken great courage.  You’ve been amazing, actually.  I’d call him, I’d say, “You’re going to be okay.”  And he said, “I know.  I really do.”\nHe’s really been supported, amazingly, by Cheryl and his family.  And it was a very tough — it was a very nasty group of people that were after him, but he was tougher, and he was smarter than they are, and that’s why he’s here today.  There are very few people that could have withstood the assault, but he was able to.\nSo, I just want to congratulate you, and we have a very special person here to swear you in.  A very — a man that I think has done just a — I think he’s just an amazing man, as you know.  His name happens to be Gorsuch, and he’s a member of the Supreme Court in extremely good standing.  He’s highly respected by everybody. And I didn’t know, are you two friends or something or did this just happen to be — Justice, did this just happen to be the luck of the draw?  What happened?\nMR. KENNEDY:  I reached out to him.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Did you reach out?\nMR. KENNEDY:  Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, you reached out to a very good man.\nSo, please, if you would.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nMR. SCHARF:  Mr. President, you have to sign the commission first.     Sorry — sorry, Justice, we just need to —\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Oh, this has to be done first.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’ll do this first.\nMR. SCHARF:  Sorry.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to make this a good one, right?\nOkay.  It’s good so far, Bobby.  Good.\n(The certificate is signed.)\nIt’s a 10.  (Laughter and applause.)  (Inaudible.)\n(The president, Justice Gorsuch, and Secretary Kennedy pose for a picture with the signed certificate.)\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Let me get out of this one.\nMS. HINES:  No, why am I in it?  I’m not — (laughter) —\nPARTICIPANT:  Go in there.  Get the kids in there.  Go in there.\nMS. HINES:  And the — oh, I’m going to hold it.  Okay, I’m holding it.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Why don’t you get in here?\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Sure.  All right.     AIDE:  Over here, please.\n(The president, Justice Gorsuch, Secretary Kennedy, and the family of Secretary Kennedy pose for a picture with the signed certificate.)  (Applause.)\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Would all the family like to join?\nPARTICIPANT:  Yeah, sure.\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Please place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right.     Repeat after me.\nI, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\nMR. KENNEDY:  I, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Do solemnly swear.\nMR. KENNEDY:  Do solemnly swear.\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  That I will support and defend.\nMR. KENNEDY:  That I will support and defend.\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  The Constitution of the United States.\nMR. KENNEDY:  The Constitution of the United States.\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Against all enemies.\nMR. KENNEDY:  Against all enemies.\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Foreign and domestic.\nMR. KENNEDY:  Foreign and domestic.\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\nMR. KENNEDY:  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  That I take this obligation freely.\nMR. KENNEDY:  That I take this obligation freely.\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: Without anty — without any mental reservation.\nMR. KENNEDY:  Without any mental reservation.\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Or purpose of evasion.\nMR. KENNEDY:  Or purpose of evasion.\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  And that I will well and faithfully discharge.\nMR. KENNEDY:  And that I will well and faithfully discharge.\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:   The duties of the office.\nMR. KENNEDY:  The duties of the office.\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  On which I am about to enter.\nMR. KENNEDY:  On which I am about to enter.\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  So help me, God.\nMR. KENNEDY:  So help me, God.\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Bobby.\nMS. HINES:  Oh, Bobby.\nSECRETARY KENNEDY:  I — I want to being by thanking President Trump for giving me this extraordinary opportunity, and I — I want to introduce my family and thank them for being here.\nMy wife, Cheryl; my cousin, Anthony Shriver; my daughter, Kick; my other daughter, Kyra; Carolina — Carolina Shriver; Joey Shriver; Jackson Hines; and Amaryllis Kennedy.\nOh, and I want to thank all of you so — for your support and throughout this whole two-and-a-half-year journey.\nI — I — my first time in this Oval Office was in 1961, and I came here to meet my — or 1962.  I came here, and I had a meeting with my uncle, who was president then, where we talked about the environment.\nHe was involved deeply, as we all know, in restoring physical fitness in this country.  He challenged — at one point during his administration, he challenged Americans to do a 50-mile walk, which I ultimately did.\nBut I remember the day that my father completed his walk.  We were staying at — at — up at Camp David.  And my father came in after 18 hours walking on the C&O towpath with his feet bleeding and blisters on them.\nMy father had a — one of his best friends was Al Lowenstein.  And Al Lowenstein ult- — ultimately — he was a congressman from New York who was assassinated himself in 1980.  But Al Lowenstein had started the “Dump Johnson” movement to get rid of President Johnson and — and end the Vietnam War.  And at the time that he started it, people just thought it was a fool’s errand.\nAnd ultimately, he asked my father to run for president against Johnson.  My father wouldn’t do it at that time, and he asked Gene McCarthy.  McCarthy did it, and he joined that campaign.\nAnd my father ultimately ran, and Johnson then dropped out.  So, Al Lowenstein had succeeded.\nAnd although Al Lowenstein was on the other side now running against my father with Gene McCarthy, my father wrote him a note — a quote from Emerson — where he said, “If a single man plants himself firmly on his own ideal, and there abide, the whole wide world will come around to him.”\nFor 20 years, I’ve gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed that God would put me in a position where I can end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country.\nOn August 23rd of last year, God sent me President Trump, and he gave me — (applause) — he’s now given me — he’s kept every promise that he’s made to me.  He’s kept his word in every account and gone way beyond it.\nI’m so grateful to you, Mr. President.  A lot of people told me that I couldn’t trust President Trump, that I better get it in writing.  And we did a handshake, and everything that he told me he was going to do, he has done.  And I’m so grateful to him.\nAnd I’ve told you before, I genuinely believe that you are a pivotal historical figure, and you are going to transform this country at a time when we see all of the indicia of democracy now in tatters in our country.  We see the rise of the military-industrial complex, the rise of totalitarianism, these attacks on our Constitution, and this breathtaking epidemic that is disabling our people.\nPresident Trump has promised to restore the American dream in this country.  A healthy person has a thousand dreams.  A sick person only has one.  Sixty percent of our population has only one dream: that they get better.\nPresident Trump has promised that he’s going to restore America’s strength.  But we can’t be a strong nation if we have a weak citizenry.  If people are sick — 60 percent of our — our people are sick.  Seventy-seven percent, as President Trump mentioned, of our children cannot qualify for military service.\nAnd pr- — we need a man on a white horse now.  We need somebody who — who is willing to come in and has the spine and the guts and the strength to challenge orthodoxies, to stand in the way of vested interests, and to break institutions that have turned against our democracy.  President Trump has shown again and again that he is that hero.\nAnd most recently, I gre- — greatly appreciate, and I called you the day that you announced the termination of USAID.  My uncle started USAID in 1961 for humanitarian purposes, to put our country on the side of the poor.  It has been captured by the military-industrial complex.  It has become a sinister propagator of totalitarianism across — and war across the globe, and very few people understand how sinister this agency really is.  And President Trump saw that, and he stood up to it with a master stroke.\nAnd we want to do the same thing with the institutions that are stealing the health of our children.  We need a revolutionary figure, and you are that figure.  And I’m very grateful for you for giving me this opportunity.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Bobby.\nSECRETARY KENNEDY:  I want to — (applause) — I just — I want to recognize some of the — the allies that I’ve had in this battle for a long time: Ra- — Senator Rand Paul; Senator Ron Johnson; Senator Roger Marshall; Marjorie Taylor Greene; and — and Buddy Carter, who have all been champions of the MAHA agenda before I even came along.  I’m very grateful for you for standing strong.\nThank you very much, President Trump.  (Applause.)\nQ    Mr. Secretary, if I could ask, what plans do you have immediately at HHS now that you’re sworn in, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s going to be running it.  He’s going to do a great job.  That’s my plan.\nQ    What would you like to see him to do first, Mr. President?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, he’s going to find out a lot of secrets that have been maybe kept from us, but he’s going to come up with some solutions to some big, big problems — solve problems.  And I think he’s going to go down in the record books.  I really have confidence.  This group has great co- — even Rand has confidence, and that’s — (laughter) — that doesn’t happen often.  (Applause.)\n(Inaudible) good luck.  Good luck.\nQ    If I could ask you, Mr. Secretary, do you plan to fire anyone immediately?  Or what are your plans on day one, which I guess is today?\nSECRETARY KENNEDY:  Our plans are radical transparency and returning gold-standard science to NIH, to the FDA, and CDC — to end — ending the corruption, ending the corporate capture of those agencies, getting rid of the people on those panels that have conflicts of interest.  We can do unadorned and unimpeded science, rather than the kind of product that is coming out of those agencies today.\nQ    Mr. Secretary, may I ask, how do you address concerns that some Americans may have about your stance on vaccines?\nSECRETARY KENNEDY:  If — when people actually hear what I think about vaccines, which is common sense — which is vaccines should be tested, they should be safe, everybody should have informed consent — people — people are reacting because they hear things about me that aren’t true.  They hear characterizations of things that I’ve said that are simply not true.\nWhen they hear what I have to say, actually, about vaccines, everybody supports it.\nQ    Mr. Kennedy, Cara Castronuova from Lindell TV.  What’s your message to Democrats in the Senate that fought so hard to keep you from taking this position?  And congratulations, by the way.\nSECRETARY KENNEDY:  President Trump has promised to be the president for all Americans, and he has said to me that he understands that there’s no such thing as Republican children or Democratic children.  All of our children need to be protected.  And whether you’re in a blue state or red state, I’m going to do everything I can to work with you, whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, to restore child’s health in this country.\nQ    Mr. Secretary, m- —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Great job.\nThank you all very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND                     3:03 P.M.

EST\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Please.  Great honor.\nI’m thrilled to welcome the Prime Minister of India, my friend, Narendra Modi back to the White House.  We spent a lot of time here and a lot of time in India, and he’s a very special man.\nPrime Minister, it is a pleasure to extend to you the same hospitality that you showed Melania and myself when we traveled to your beautiful country five years ago.  It’s hard to believe so long ago, and it seemed like yesterday.  It was beautiful.  We opened the cricket stadium — 129,000 seats, I think the largest stadium in the world, and it was an incredible period of time.\nThere is truly a special bond between the United States and India and the world’s oldest democracy and the world’s largest democracy and, I believe, the world’s largest country, in terms of the numbers of people.  And today, the prime minister and I are announcing a framework to strengthen those ties even further economically, and the U.S.-India compact for the 21st century is a historic initiative that will deepen every aspect of our partnership and our friendship.\nStarting this year, we’ll be increasing military sales to India by many billions of dollars.  We’re also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters.\nIn 2017, my administration revived and reinvigorated the Quad security partnership.  In our meeting today, the prime minister and I reaffirmed that strong cooperation among the United States, India, Australia, and Japan, and it’s crucial really to maintaining peace and prosperity, tranquility even, in the Indo-Pacific.\nIn addition, the United States and India will be working together like never before to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, a threat all over the world actually.\nToday, I’m pleased to announce that my administration has approved the extradition of one of the plotters and one of the very evil people of the world and having to do with the horrific 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack to face justice in India.  So, he’s going to be going back to India to face justice.\nAs we deepen our defense partnership, we’ll also strengthen our economic ties and bring greater fairness and reciprocity to our trading relationship.\nAs a signal of good faith, Prime Minister Modi recently announced the reductions to India’s unfair, very strong tariffs that limit U.S. access into the Indian market very strongly.  And really, it’s big problem, I must say.  India imposes a 30 to 40 to 60 and even 70 percent tariff on so many of the goods and, in some cases, far more than that.\nAs an example, a 70 percent tariff on U.S. cars going into India, which makes it pretty much impossible to sell those cars.\nToday, the U.S. trade deficit with India is almost $100 billion, and Prime Minister Modi and I have agreed that we’ll begin negotiations to address the long-running disparities that should have been taken care of over the last four years — but they didn’t do that — in the U.S.-India trading relationship, with the goal of signing an agreement.  And we want — really, we want a certain level playing field, which we really think we’re entitled to, and he does also, in fairness, so we’re going to work on that very hard.  And we can make up the difference very easily with the deficit with the sale of oil and gas and LNG, of which we have more than anybody in the world.\nThe prime minister and I also reached an important agreement on energy that will restore the United States as a leading supplier of oil and gas to India.  It will be, hopefully, their number-one supplier in the groundbreaking development for U.S. nuclear industry.  India is also reforming its laws to welcome U.S. nuclear technology, which is at the highest level, into the Indian market.  This will bring safe, clean, and affordable electricity to millions of Indians and tens of billions of dollars to the U.S.-civilian nuclear industry in India.\nAnd under the framework we are announcing today, the United States and India are also joining forces to ensure that artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies are developed by the two of the most — really, two of the most advanced nations, intellectually and otherwise technologically, anywhere in the world.  There’s nobody very much closer.  We have an incredible relationship there.  And this is where it seems to be heading.\nAnd artificial intelligence — complex — a very complex subject, but it seems to be where people want to be and they want to go, and we’re leading right now by a lot, but other people will try to catch us.  I don’t know if they’re going to be able to.  We’re going to make it available.  We’re going to make tremendous amounts of electricity available, and we’re going to let the people that are buying the electricity make their own electric plants — electric generation plants, and we’ve never done this in our country, but we’re going to get it done very quickly.\nLee Zeldin and his group are going to get the approvals in very rapid form.  And we’re calling it a “national emergency,” and that’s exactly what it is.  So, we’re going to be — we’re going to remain at the top of the AI or artificial intelligence, I think, for a long time to come, and we’re going to be working very closely with India and other countries on that.  But right now, we’re the leader by quite a bit.\nFinally, we agreed to work together to help build one of the greatest trade routes in all of history.  It will run from India to Israel to Italy and onward to the United States, connecting our partners by ports, railways, and undersea cables — many, many undersea cables.  It’s a big development.  It’s a lot of money going to be spent, and we’ve already spent some, but we’re going to be spending a lot more in order to stay advanced and stay the leader.\nI’m pleased to report that with today’s announcements, the friendship between the United States and India is the strongest I believe it’s ever been.  I think our relationship is the best it’s ever been between two leaders of the two countries, and it’s an honor to say that.\nI’d like to now invite the prime minister to say a few words, and then we’ll take some questions.  And we appreciate you all being here.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:  (As interpreted.)  Your Excellency President Trump, delegates of both countries, friends from the media: Namashkar.\nI would like to first of all express my heartfelt gratitude to my dear friend President Trump for the grand welcome and hospitality accorded to me.  President Trump’s leadership has been instrumental in nurturing India-U.S. ties and making them vibrant.\nI could feel today the same enthusiasm, the same — the same enthusiasm, the same energy, the same commitment that we had worked with during our first term.\nOur discussions today highlighted our pride in our accomplishments during his first term, the deep mutual trust that we share, and also the resolve to attain new goals.  We also agreed that the partnership and cooperation between India and the U.S. can shape a better world.\nFriends, the people of America are aware of President Trump’s motto, “Make America Great Again,” or “MAGA.”  The people are well aware of it.  The people of India too are focusing on both heritage and development as they move forward at a fast pace and with a firm resolve to ensure a developed India by 2047.  If I were to say this, borrowing an expression from America, our vision for a developed India is to “Make India Great Again,” or “MIGA.”\nWhen America and India work together, that is when MAGA — when it’s MAGA plus MIGA, it becomes mega — a mega partnership for prosperity.  (Applause.)  And it is this mega spirit that gives new scale and scope to our objectives.\nFriends, today, we have also set ourselves the target of more than doubling our bilateral trade to attain $500 billion by 2030.  Our teams will work on concluding very soon a mutually beneficial trade agreement.\nIn order to ensure India’s energy security, we will focus on trade in oil and gas.  Investment in energy infrastructure will also increase.  In the area of nuclear energy, we also discussed increasing cooperation on small modular reactors.\nFriends, America plays an important role in India’s defense preparedness.  As strategic and trusted partners, we are moving forward actively towards joint development, joint production, and transfer of technology.\nIn the times to come as well, new technologies and equipment will enhance our capacities.      We have decided to launch the autonomous systems industry alliance and a defense cooperation framework for the next decade will be prepared.  Defense interoperability, logistics, repair, and maintenance will also be its key components.\nFriends, the 21st century is a technology-driven century.  Close cooperation in the area of technology between countries that believe in democratic values can give new direction, strength, and opportunities to the entire humanity.  India and the U.S. will jointly work in areas of artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum, biotechnology, and several other technologies.\nToday, we also agreed on TRUST, which stands for Transforming Relationships Utilizing Strategic Technology.  Under this, our focus will be on establishing strong supply chains for critical minerals, advanced materials, and pharmaceuticals.\nWe have also decided to launch a recovery and processing initiative for strategic minerals like lithium and rare earths.\nWe have had close cooperation with the U.S. in the area of space.  The NISAR satellite developed with mutual cooperation between Israel and NASA will soon be flying into space on an Indian launch vehicle.\nFriends, partnership between India and the U.S. strengthens democracy and strengthens democratic values and systems.  We will work together to enhance peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.  The Quad will play a special role in this.  During the Quad summit scheduled to be held in India this year, we will expand cooperation in new areas with our partner countries.  Under the IMEEC and I2U2, we will work together for the development of economic corridors.\nAnd in the area of connectivity, India and U.S. will stand strongly together in the fight against terrorism.  We agree that in order to eliminate cross-border terrorism, we need concrete actions, and I’m very grateful to President Trump that he — in 2008, somebody who carried out genocide in India, that criminal is now going to be handed over to India, and I’m grateful to President Trump for this, and appropriate action will be taken in the courts in India.\nFriends, the Indian community living in the U.S. is an important link in our relations.  In order to further deepen our people-to-people ties, India will soon open new consulates in Los Angeles and Boston.  These will be new consulates.\nWe have invited American universities and educational institutes to open their offshore campuses in India.\nPresident Trump, I am grateful to you for your friendship and strong commitment towards India.  The people of India still fondly remember your visit in 2020 and hope that President Trump will come and visit them again.  On behalf of 1.4 billion Indians, I invite you to visit India.\nThank you.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Great job.\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:  Thank you.  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Beautiful.\nOkay, thank you very much.  That was excellent.\nWe’ll do a few questions, please.\nQ    Mr. President —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Please, go ahead.  Please, go ahead.  Yeah.  Yeah, blue shirt.\nQ    Me?\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.  People in India will naturally welcome your decision to extradite Tahawwur Rana to India back home.  In that context, I would like to ask you a question about — in last few years, we have seen several groups in the U.S. been raising anti-India voice, calling about separation — terrorism activities in India.  Do you think that should continue here in the U.S. as well?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  You’re going to have to go louder.\nQ    Mr. President, people in India would be welcoming your decision to extradite Tahawwur Rana to India —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, I can’t understand —\nQ    Okay.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  — a word he’s saying.  It’s not the — it’s the accent.  It’s a little bit tough for me.\nQ    But can I try again?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  How about — how about you.  Please.  Go ahead, back there.\nQ    Thank you.  Thank you very much.\nQ    Mr. President, thank you.  First, I want to ask the prime minister a question.  You and the president — you both spoke about combating ISIS.  You — you both sounded very exciting about this — excited about this partnership upcoming, and I — I was curious, how much more confident are you with President Trump leading this country that there will be peace through strength and you will have a suc- — successful partnership with the United States, versus with Biden’s incompetence and weakness over the last four years?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  (Laughs.)  (Laughter.)  That’s your question, but I’ll answer it.  I agree with you.  (Laughter.)  Yeah, gross incompetence.\nWe’re going to have a fantastic relationship.  And it has been like the whole world has been set back over the last four years by the weakness of the United States, the weak leadership of the United States, but I think we’ve taken care of it in just three weeks.  It seems to me that even some of the media that we wouldn’t prefer has been writing that this is a much different country right now, that the world has a light over it — not only our country, but the whole world.\nThe prime minister told me that before too.  Even over India, the world has a light.  They need the United States to be strong and powerful but good, and I think that’s happened.  And I think it’s happened in a very short period of time.\nBut I will tell you, we’re going to have a fantastic relationship, and it will make both countries much stronger.\n(Cross-talk.)\nAll right?      Yes, go ahead, please.\nQ    Geeta Mohan from India today, sir.  I’ll just take my colleague Lalit Jha’s question forward, because you couldn’t underst- —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay.  Fine.\nQ    The question is about the fact that you’ve decided to extradite Tahawwur Rana.  Thank you so much.  India has been waiting to — to have him back in India to bring him to justice.\nBut there are many other elements in the United States of America, particularly Khalistani separates who’ve been working against Indian interests.  How is the United States of America going to cooperate on that front with India?  There are — there have been allegations that have been leveled against Indian agencies by the Biden administration.  Are you going to relook that with Tulsi Gabbard as DNI now?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I don’t think India had a very good relationship with the Biden administration.  Biden — they wouldn’t sell them oil and gas, which is rather hard to believe, because, you know, it’s a good thing to do.  And a lot of things happened that weren’t very appropriate, I thought, between India and the administration — the Biden administration.\nBut as you said, we’re giving a very violent man — it seems to me — I mean, I don’t know that he’s been convicted yet or will be, but let’s assume he’s a pretty violent person — we’re giving him back to India immediately.  And there are more to follow, because we have quite a few requests.\nSo, we work with India on crime, and we want to make it good for India, and it’s very important.  So, that kind of a relationship is very important to us.\nOkay?\n(Cross-talk.)\nGo ahead, please.\nQ    Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Go ahead.\nQ    Thank you.  Mr. President, you’ve repeatedly called India a big abuser of trade and said it is really difficult to do business in India because of tariffs.  You announced reciprocal tariffs today.  I am hoping you can speak about what kind of reciprocal tariffs India can expect.  Are you willing to make any concessions, and how can India head off these tariffs?\nI also have one for the prime minister.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Sure.\nWell, India has been, to us, just about the highest tariffed nation anywhere in the world.  They’ve been very strong on tariffs, and I don’t blame them, necessarily, but it’s a different way of doing business.  It’s very hard to sell into India because they have trade barriers, very strong tariffs.\nWe are right now a reciprocal nation.  We are going to — if it’s India or if it’s somebody else with low tariffs, we’re going to have the same.  We’re going to have whatever India charges, we’re charging them.  Whatever another country charges, we’re charging them.  So, it’s called reciprocal, which I think is a very fair way.  We didn’t have that.\nI was going to do that in my other term, and we had the greatest economy ever in the world.  There’s never been an economy like we had, and then we got hit with COVID.  We had a focus on that, and I wasn’t really in the mood to be putting it on Italy and Spain and France and India, frankly, and a lot of other countries, because the world was very troubled until we got rid of that nightmare.\nBut we had the strongest economy anywhere in the world during that fairly long period of time during my first term, as you know, and we didn’t do the tariffs.  We would have done the reciprocal tariffs, but we decided — and I decided, I think, on a human basis — on a humane basis not to do them because of the fact that there was such suffering all over the world.  The last thing we needed to talk about is trade problems.\nBut now we’re doing — we see a tremendous future for our country.  But we felt that now it’s finally time, after 45 or 50 years of abuse, that we will do — and this isn’t India, this is among a lot of nations.\nThe European Union is very difficult for us — very, very difficult.  They tax our companies at levels that nobody’s ever seen before.  They take advantage of a lot of things.  So, we’re not happy about that.\nChina, of course, is terrible, and we’ve never taken in 10 cents until I was president.  We’ve taken in hundreds of billions of dollars from China since I’ve been president — in first term and now — and we have to do that just as a mechanism of fairness, and that’s what I’ve done.\nAnd so, we are being reciprocal with India.  Whatever India charges, we charge them.  So, frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge, because whatever they charge — I had discussions with India in the first term about the fact that their tariffs were very high, and I was unable to get a concession.  So, we’re just going to do it the easy way, and we’re just going to say, “Whatever you charge, we charge.”  And I think that’s fair for the people of the United States, and I think it’s actually fair for India.\nOkay?\nQ    Are you willing to make any concessions, sir?  Are you willing to make any concessions, sir?  Any concessions?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Go ahead, please.  Ask to the prime minister, please.\nQ    A question for the prime minister, please.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Ask to the prime minister, please.\nQ    Yes, sorry.  Yoshita Singh with Press Trust of India.  Prime Minist- — thank you, Mr. President.\nPrime Minister, the U.S. is giving a lot of push to curb illegal immigration, and India has been cooperating on this issue.  How does India see this issue in the larger context?  Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:  (As interpreted.)  I don’t think this is a question that is about India only, but, even globally, you can talk about this issue.  And we are of the opinion that anybody who enters another country illegally, they — they have absolutely no right to be in that country.\nAnd as far as India and the U.S. is concerned, we have always been of the same opinion, and that is that any verified Indian who is in the U.S. illegally, we are fully prepared to take them back to India.  However, it doesn’t stop there.\nThese are children of very ordinary families, and they are lured by big dreams and big promises.  A lot of them are brought in without them knowing about why they are going to a country.  And, in fact, they are connected with a human trafficking system, and we have to make sure that we fight against this system.\nAs far as the U.S. and India is concerned, I think what we should do is make efforts to make sure that we uproot these from within the system so that we can reduce or remove human trafficking.  And basically, the young, vulnerable, poor people of India are fooled into coming over as illegal immigrants, and our bigger fight, actually, is against this ecosystem or this system that encourages such gangs to thrive.  And I can tell you that India will completely support your endeavor in achieving this.\n(Cross-talk.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.\nQ    Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  A question for Prime Minister Modi first, if I may.  I wanted to ask you: Did you discuss any possible business deals with Elon Musk during your — your meetings today, Mr. Prime Minister?\nAnd, Mr. President, I wanted to ask you: Today, you spoke about hoping to have three-way talks with President Xi and President Putin.  What would you say to European leaders and other allies who may be concerned that you’re apparently more keen to speak to America’s adversaries than to its allies?   Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, maybe I’ll just go and — first on this one.  We had some talks, and we told the European Union, we told the NATO people — largely, they overlap — “You have to pay more money because it’s unfair what we’re doing.  We’re doing a tremendous amount more.”  We’re probably $200 billion more going into Ukraine, using for Ukraine to fight, and Europe has not really carried its weight in terms of the money.  It’s not equitable, and we want to see a counterbalance.  We want to have them put up more money.  They have to do that.\nAt the same time, we had a very good conversation with President Putin the other day — yesterday.  And we also had a very good conversation — I did, both — in both cases — with President Zelenskyy.  And I think we’re going to be able to do something.  I think we’re going to be able to make a deal, and I hope so, because it’s a horrible war.  It’s a very terrible, bloody war with a million and a half soldiers, at least, already dead on the battlefield, lying all over the fields like — nobody has ever seen anything like it since — certainly since the Second World War.\nAnd so, I think we’re going to be able to do something.  We’re working with President Zelenskyy and with President Putin, and my impression is that they — I know that President Zelenskyy wants to make a deal, and I also feel that — I know that President Putin wants to make a deal.  I wanted to know that before I began any detailed discussions.\nBut the meeting and the — the conversation — also, the meeting with Steve Witkoff in Moscow was a very successful one, and my phone call with him was a very successful one.\nPlease.\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:  (As interpreted.)  You asked a question regarding Elon Musk.  I have known him for a very long time.  I was not even prime minister at the time when I first met him; I was chief minister.  And today he came to meet me along with all his family, with his children.  And so, we had a nice discussion.\nAs far as the EV is concerned — EVs are concerned, the EV — the word “EV” has a copyright.  And that is one person who has a copyright for the word “EV,” and that is Trump.\n(Cross-talk.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.  That was very nice.\nGo ahead, please.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.  Can I ask whether you discussed at all today the case of Gautam Adani, who’s one of the weal- — the wealthiest men in Asia and perceived as an ally of Prime Minister Modi?\nPrime Minister Modi, have you asked the president to take action on that case?  Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:  (As interpreted.)  Firstly, India is a democratic country, and our culture and our thought philosophy is Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which basically means that the entire world is a family.  Every Indian is my own family member.  And when it comes to such personal matters, two cou- — leaders of two countries will not get together on that topic and discuss anything on an individual matter.\n(Cross-talk.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Go ahead.  Please.  Yeah.  Please.\nQ    Which one?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:   Sir, go ahead, please.\nQ    Yeah.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.  I have a question for you as well.\nBut, Mr. President, you have suggested — with regards to the Russia-Ukraine war, you’ve suggested several things that Ukraine should give up: the idea of NATO membership, territory that was seized back in 2014 by Russia.  What should Russia give up?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Russia has gotten themselves into something that I think they wish they didn’t.  If I were president, it would not have happened — absolutely would not have happened, and it didn’t happen for four years.\nIf you look at what has taken place, under President Bush, they lost a lot.  Under President Obama, they lost Crimea.  Under Biden, it looks like they could lose the whole thing.  Under Trump, they lost nothing — Ukraine lost nothing.  They didn’t give up anything.  And you take a look at the other three presidents surrounding me, they gave up a lot.\nI think that when you look at Ukraine and when you look at the mess that they’re in, it’s got to be ended, and it’s got to be stopped.\nNow, Russia has taken over a pretty big chunk of territory, and they also have said from day one — long before President Putin, they’ve said they cannot have Ukraine be in NATO.  They said that very strongly.\nI actually think that that was the thing that caused the start of the war.  And Biden said it, and Zelenskyy said it, and I think that was one of the reasons — one of the starts of the war.\nBut from long before Putin, they said you cannot have Ukraine going in, in any way, into NATO.  And I start from that standpoint.  I think everybody knew that.\nNow, if a better deal can be negotiated, if they were able to make a deal where they can do that, that’s fine with me.  I really don’t care.  I want that bloodshed to stop.  I don’t want to see — you know, we have an ocean between us and the site we’re talking about — the site of death.  We’re calling it the fields of death.  We have a big ocean in between us.  This is more important for Europe.  We shouldn’t be in — they have to equalize, and they’re going to have to do it fast, but they have to equalize.\nBut as far as the negotiation, it’s too early to say what’s going to happen.  Maybe Russia will give up a lot, maybe they won’t, and it’s all dependent on what is going to happen.  The negotiation really hasn’t started.\nBut I will say, as far as NATO is concerned, from many years before President Putin, I will tell you that I’ve heard that Russia would never accept that, and I think Ukraine knew that, because Ukraine wasn’t in and never requested to be in until more recently.  So, that’s the way it is, and I think that’s the way it’s going to have to be.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    But, Mr. President — Mr. President, I —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Go ahead, please.  All right.  Go ahead, please, with the tie.\n(Cross-talk.)\nWith the tie, yeah.\nQ    Mr. President, I have a question for the prime minister.\nQ    Mr. President —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, go ahead, please.\nQ    This is Saurabh Shukla from NewsMobile.  Mr. President, you spoke about Prime Minister Modi as a tough negotiator.  Who was a tougher negotiator today, and who has a better negotiating tactic when it comes to tariffs with —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Oh, he’s a much tougher negotiator than me, and he’s a much better negotiator than me.  There’s not even a contest.  Okay?  (Laughter.)\n(Cross-talk.)\nYeah, go ahead.  Please go ahead.  Go ahead.\nQ    Reena Bhardwaj from ANI.  How do you see this relationship between the India and the United States to counter China?  And what is your vision when it comes to India, you know, brokering peace in the Ukraine and Russia conflict?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think we are going to have a very good relationship with China.  I got along with President Xi very well until COVID.  That was a bridge too far.  But until then, I got along with President Xi very, very well.  We were very close, as leaders go.  I don’t want to be naive, but as leaders go, I think we were very close.\nAnd I think that China is a very important player in the world.  I think they can help us get this war over with Ukraine and Russia.\nAnd I look at India, I do see the skirmishes on the border, which are quite vicious, and I guess they continue to go on.  If I could be of help, I’d love to help, because that should be stopped.  That’s been going on for a long time, and it’s quite violent.  It’s quite violent.\nBut I would hope that China and India and Russia and U.S. and all of us can get along.  It’s very important.\nYou know, the power of weaponry today is — and not only nuclear, but nuclear, in particular — the power of weaponry is very important.  I said before that I had very constructive talks in my first term with President Putin about the denuclearization of the two countries.  And then we were going to go to China after we worked some kind of a deal, and we had the confines of a deal.  We were — I thought we — he really wanted to do it and so did I — denuclearize.  And it’s such a beautiful term, when you think about it.  In other words, to bring it down, because the power of those weapons is too great.\nAnd I did speak to President Xi about that, and I was getting also a very good response.  He’s building a very strong nuclear power.  He’s not very close to Russia or the United States right now, but he will be soon.  I mean, he’ll catch up over the period of four or five years, they say.\nBut it would be a great thing if we could — on a military basis, we’re going to spend this year 900- — let’s say $915 billion on military.  Russia, without the war, was spending close to a hundred, but with the war, I can’t tell you what they’re spending, but they’re spending a lot.  And China is spending $400- and $450 billion.  We’re over $900 billion.  And I said, “You know, it doesn’t really make sense.”  I said, “We’re spending the money against each other, and we could spend that money for better purpose if we got along.”  And I’ll tell you, I think that something like that will happen.\nFirst, when I left, as you know, four years ago, we didn’t have Israel and the Middle East.  We didn’t have October 7th — what a disaster — the disaster.  Nothing was happening.  Iran was not going to do anything, because Iran did not have much money at that point.  They were broke.  They were totally broke.  They didn’t have money for Hamas or for Hezbollah.  And you didn’t have Russia with Ukraine, and that would never have happened.\nBut now I come back, and I have — the whole world is on fire, so I have to put out the fires.  But after I put out the fires, I’m going to meet with China, and I’m going to meet with Russia, and we’re going to see if we can de-escalate, if we can bring it down — military — especially as it pertains to nuclear.\nPlease.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    And India’s role — India’s role in — how do —\nQ    Mr. President, you mentioned about American Islamic terrorism —\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Prime Minister, how do you see India play a role in a — in de-escalating the Ukraine-Russia —\nINTERPRETER:  Mic, please.\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:  (No translation provided.)\nQ    (As interpreted.)  Prime Minister, how do you see India’s role?  You have had discussions with President Trump about de-escalating the conflict in Russia and Ukraine.\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:  (As interpreted.)  As you know, I have been in constant contact with both Russia and Ukraine.  I have also visited both countries.  And many peoples are mistaken and they feel that India is neutral.  I would like to clarify: India is not neutral.  We have taken a side, and we have taken the side of peace.\nAnd it is based on this principle of ours that, in the presence of President Putin, I clearly said in front of the media that this is not the era of war.  And even today, it is my conviction that solutions cannot be found on the battlefield.  Ultimately, you have to come to the negotiating table, and India has constantly made efforts that there are talks that take place where both parties are present.  It is only then that we will find a solution.\nThe efforts being made by President Trump — I support them, I welcome them, and I would like that President Trump is successful as soon as possible so that the world is on the path to peace once again.\n(Cross-talk.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Everybody, thank you very much.  Thank you very much.\n(Cross-talk.)\nAnd I very much appreciate the prime minister visiting our great country, and I do really appreciate it.  We have so much in common, and all we want to do is have peace, and we want to have strength, and we want to have lots of different things together, but the relationship with India and with the prime minister has never been better.\nThank you very much.\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  A great honor.  Thank you.\nEND                6:45 P.M.

We estimated that the federal government could lose between $233 billion and $521 billion annually to fraud.” President Donald J. Trump is determined to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and put an end to fraudulent and wasteful spending."

    "content": "After years of being wrongfully detained in a Russian prison, U.S. citizen Marc Fogel is finally home thanks to the relentless efforts by President Donald Trump and his administration to secure his release — making good on a promise President Donald Trump made to Fogel’s 95-year-old mother, Malphine. Fogel said it best: “President Trump is a hero … I will forever be indebted to President Trump, to Steve [Witkoff] over there — what a dynamic man this guy is. When I met him, the energy, the can-do attitude just exudes from his body.” His release was met with immediate praise from Fogel’s family and a bipartisan group of officials and lawmakers: The Fogel Family: “We are beyond grateful, relieved, and overwhelmed that after more than three years of detention, our father, husband, and son, Marc Fogel, is finally coming home … Thanks to the unwavering leadership of President Trump, Marc will soon be back on American soil, free where he belongs. This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal.” Malphine Fogel: “I would like to thank [President Trump] profusely. He promised me he would get him out — and he kept his promise, and I can’t thank him enough.” Anne Fogel: “[President Trump] was true to his word. It’s amazing. It’s just such a different relationship and I’m just so incredibly grateful to the president.” Fogel lawyers Martin De Luca and Andrew Smith: “Marc Fogel’s release is historic, long overdue, and a testament to the power of strong leadership. After years of bureaucratic inaction including consistent refusals to designate Marc as wrongfully detained, President Trump secured Marc’s release in just a few weeks, wasting no time in taking decisive action to bring Marc home.” Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA): “After more than 3 years in Russian captivity, I join his family, our federal partners, and all of his fellow Pennsylvanians in welcoming Marc Fogel home — exactly where he belongs. Thank you to those at the @WhiteHouse who made his release possible, and to his wife Jane, mom, siblings, and kids here in Pennsylvania who never, ever gave up.” Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA): “Marc Fogel’s return home is long overdue—and I know all of Pennsylvania, especially his family, will be welcoming him back with open arms. I want to thank @POTUS and @SteveWitkoff for their efforts in finally bringing Marc home.” Sen. Dave McCormick (R-PA): “Thank you @POTUS for bringing Marc home! All of Pennsylvania is happy he is back safely, especially his amazing 95 year old mom, Mafa, who never stopped fighting for his release. Dina and I were honored to witness this emotional and historic moment tonight at the White House.” Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA): “When President Trump met with Marc Fogel’s mother, Malphine, in Butler on July 13, 2024, he pledged to do everything he could to bring Marc home safely. Today, President Trump, Secretary Rubio, and the Trump administration have fulfilled this promise. I want to thank President Trump for successfully securing Marc’s release and for reuniting the Fogel family.” Rep. GT Thompson (R-PA): “After more than three and a half long years of detention, Marc Fogel is finally on his way home from Russia. Thank you to President Trump, Secretary Rubio, and the President’s Special Envoy Steve Witkoff for their urgency and dedication to bringing Marc home.” Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul: “Hallelujah! Fantastic news! Praise be to President Donald Trump … This is just fantastic news for anybody who cares about patriotic Americans.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio: “None of this is possible without President Trump. This is the tenth America that’s come home after being detained somewhere overseas — in just three weeks in the White House.”\nSpecial Envoy Steve Witkoff: “The president’s policy on Americans that are held abroad is that we leave nobody behind. It’s very similar to the military credo … I think that you’ll see a President who is extraordinarily proactive in seeking all hostages to be released.”\n\n###\n"

    "title": "Adjusting Imports of Aluminum into The United States",
    "category": "Presidential Actions",
    "date": "2025-02-11",
    "slug": "adjusting-imports-of-aluminum-into-the-united-states",
    "content": "BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION\n1.  On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (section 232).  The Secretary found and advised me of the Secretary’s opinion that aluminum is being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.\n2.  In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary’s finding that aluminum was being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries.  Proclamation 9704 further stated that any country with which the United States has a security relationship is welcome to discuss alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require.\n3.  In Proclamation 9704, I also directed the Secretary to monitor imports of aluminum articles and inform me of any circumstances that in the Secretary’s opinion might indicate the need for further action under section 232 with respect to such imports.  Pursuant to Proclamation 9704, the Secretary was authorized to provide relief from the additional duties, based on a request from a directly affected party located in the United States, for any aluminum article determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality, or based upon specific national security considerations.  Proclamation 9776 of August 29, 2018, and Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 2020, similarly authorized the Secretary to provide relief from certain tariffs on other aluminum products and derivatives set forth in those proclamations.\n4.  In subsequent proclamations, the President adjusted the tariffs applicable to aluminum articles imports from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, the European Union (EU), and the United Kingdom (UK), after engaging in discussions with each of those parties on alternative ways to address the threat to the national security from such imports.\n5.  The Secretary has informed me that, notwithstanding the 10 percent ad valorem tariff imposed by Proclamation 9704 that mitigated the threatened impairment of our national security, aluminum imports into the United States have continued at unacceptable levels as the global aluminum excess capacity crisis continues.  In addition, the exclusion of certain countries and products from the tariff and efforts by foreign producers to circumvent the tariff have undermined the purpose of Proclamation 9704, which was to adjust the level of imports of aluminum to remove the threatened impairment of the national security.  This has again resulted in aluminum smelter capacity utilization rates in the domestic aluminum industry that are well below the target level recommended in the Secretary’s January 19, 2018, report.  This indicates that the initial tariff of 10 percent ad valorem is not high enough to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by aluminum imports.\n6.  In particular, the Secretary has informed me that global primary aluminum capacity has continued to increase, fueled by expansions in the People’s Republic of China (China) and South America, which is seen in rising aluminum imports that continue to weigh on the price domestic aluminum producers may charge.  There has also been a significant increase in Chinese investment in Mexico, driven by massive Chinese government subsidies and the continued ability to exploit loopholes in U.S. trade policy.\n7.   Domestic aluminum producers have been forced to idle additional production and shut down facilities.  Two primary aluminum smelters within the United States have closed since Proclamation 9704 was promulgated.  In addition, U.S. primary aluminum production decreased by 30 percent from 2020 to 2024, and U.S. smelter capacity utilization was only 52 percent in 2024.  Overcapacity for primary aluminum has harmed downstream aluminum producers, including producers of aluminum extrusions and aluminum sheet.  To allow U.S. aluminum producers to restart production and to incentivize new capacity, additional adjustments to section 232 tariffs on aluminum need to be made, including limiting exemptions and increasing the tariff rate.\n8.  The Secretary has informed me that imports of aluminum articles from countries that are excluded from the tariff regime or have alternative arrangements have remained significantly elevated at levels that once again threaten to impair the national security of the United States.  The volume of U.S. imports of aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, EU countries, and the UK in 2024 was approximately 14 percent higher than the average volume of such imports in 2015 through 2017.  In particular, the volume of U.S. imports of primary aluminum from Canada in 2024 was approximately 18 percent higher than the average volume for 2015 through 2017.  Notwithstanding Proclamation 10782 of July 10, 2024, which imposed higher tariffs on certain aluminum imports from Mexico, imports of aluminum from Mexico have continued to surge beyond historical volumes.  The volume of U.S. imports of aluminum articles from Mexico in 2024 was approximately 35 percent higher than the average volume for 2015 through 2017.  Proclamation 10782 did not resolve the surge of imports of aluminum from Mexico.  Mexican producers are using unfair trade to gain market share in the United States and are leveraging their access to unfairly traded global primary aluminum to do so.  I understand that Mexican producers are commingling primary aluminum from China and the Russian Federation (Russia) with primary aluminum from other countries to produce downstream aluminum articles.  These practices are distortive and provide continued outlets to absorb the massive amount of global excess capacity and must be remedied.  The volume of U.S. imports of primary aluminum from Australia has also surged and in 2024 was approximately 103 percent higher than the average volume for 2015 through 2017.  Australia has disregarded its verbal commitment to voluntarily restrain its aluminum exports to a reasonable level.\n9.  These volume increases occurred even though demand for aluminum in the United States and Canada (the market measured by industry) has generally remained flat, averaging about 20 percent since 2018.\n10.  These increasing import volumes support the conclusion that aluminum producers in countries subject to the additional ad valorem tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 are engaging in transshipment or further processing of upstream aluminum products in countries that have since been exempted from that tariff.  Foreign producers have shifted assembly or manufacturing operations to third countries, such as Mexico.  For example, Chinese producers are using Mexico’s general exclusion from the tariff to funnel Chinese aluminum to the United States through Mexico while avoiding the tariff.\n11.  The Secretary has informed me that producers in countries that remain subject to the ad valorem tariff have continued to evade the tariff by processing covered aluminum articles into additional downstream derivative products that were not included in the additional ad valorem tariffs proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9980.  Foreign producers are continuing to expand downstream production to absorb the global excess capacity.  Imports of additional derivative aluminum products have increased significantly since the issuance of Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9980, eroding the domestic industry’s customer base and resulting in depressed demand for aluminum articles produced in the United States.\n12.  The Secretary has also informed me of the impact of the product exclusion process authorized by Proclamation 9704, Proclamation 9776, and Proclamation 9980 and implemented by subsequent regulations.  This process has resulted in exclusions for a significant volume of imports, in a manner that undermines the purpose of the section 232 measures and threatens to impair the national security of the United States.  Certain general approved exclusions remain in effect for entire tariff lines of aluminum imports, notwithstanding the domestic industry’s potential to produce many excluded products.\n13.  I determine that these developments and modifications to the original tariff regime as proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 have undermined the regime’s national security objectives by preventing the domestic aluminum industry (including derivatives) from achieving sustained production capacity utilization of at least 80 percent, as determined in the Secretary’s January 19, 2018, report.  I also determine that the modifications failed to achieve their articulated objectives.  As a result, I determine that these modifications have resulted in significantly increasing imports of aluminum articles that once again threaten to impair the national security of the United States.\n14.  In light of the Secretary’s findings, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to adjust the tariff proclaimed by Proclamation 9704, as amended, and the tariff proclaimed by Proclamation 9980, as amended, to increase the tariff rate from 10 percent ad valorem to 25 percent ad valorem.  These actions are necessary and appropriate to remove the threatened impairment of the national security of the United States.\n15.  In light of the Secretary’s findings regarding the alternative agreements with Argentina proclaimed in Proclamation 9758 of May 31, 2018; Australia proclaimed in Proclamation 9758; Canada proclaimed in Proclamation 9893 of May 19, 2019, and Proclamation 10106 of October 27, 2020; Mexico proclaimed in Proclamation 9893 and Proclamation 10782 of July 10, 2024; the European Union proclaimed in Proclamation 10327 of December 27, 2021, and Proclamation 10690 of December 28, 2023; and the United Kingdom proclaimed in Proclamation 10405 of May 31, 2022, I have decided that it is necessary to terminate these agreements as of March 12, 2025.  As of March 12, 2025, all imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, EU countries, and the UK shall be subject to the additional ad valorem tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, with respect to aluminum articles and Proclamation 9980, as amended, with respect to derivative aluminum articles.  Imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, EU countries, and the UK shall be subject to the revised tariff rate of 25 percent ad valorem established in clause 2 of this proclamation, commensurate with the tariff rate imposed on such articles imported from most other countries.  In my judgment, these modifications are necessary to address the significantly increasing imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from these sources, which threaten to impair the national security of the United States.  Replacing the alternative agreements with the additional ad valorem tariffs will be a more robust and effective means of ensuring that the objectives articulated in the Secretary’s January 19, 2018, report and subsequent proclamations are achieved.\n16.  In light of the information provided by the Secretary that the significant increase of imports of certain derivative aluminum articles has depressed demand for aluminum articles produced by domestic aluminum producers, I have determined that it is necessary to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9980 to apply to additional derivative aluminum articles.\n17.  I have also determined that it is necessary to terminate the product exclusion process as authorized in clause 3 of Proclamation 9704, clause 1 of Proclamation 9776, and clause 2 of Proclamation 9980.\n18.  Section 232, as amended, authorizes the President to take action to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.\n19.  Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, and section 232, do hereby proclaim as follows:\n- The provisions of Proclamation 9758 with respect to imports of aluminum articles from the Argentina; Proclamation 9758 with respect to imports of aluminum articles from the Australia; Proclamation 9893 and Proclamation 10106 with respect to imports of aluminum articles from Canada; Proclamation 9893 and Proclamation 10782 with respect to imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from Mexico; Proclamation 10327 and Proclamation 10690 with respect to imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from the European Union; and Proclamation 10405 with respect to imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from the United Kingdom shall be ineffective as of 12:01 a.m. eastern time on March 12, 2025.  The provisions of clause 1 of Proclamation 9980 as applicable to imports of derivative aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, Canada, and Mexico shall be ineffective as of 12:01 a.m. eastern time on March 12, 2025; all imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from these countries shall be subject to the additional ad valorem tariffs proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, and Proclamation 9980, as amended.  Imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, EU countries, and the United Kingdom will be subject to the revised tariff rate of 25 percent ad valorem established in clauses (2) and (3) of this proclamation, commensurate with the tariff rate imposed on such articles imported from most countries, as amended by this proclamation.\n- As of 12:01 a.m. on March 12, 2025, the tariff proclaimed by Proclamation 9704, as amended, and the tariff proclaimed by Proclamation 9980, as amended, are adjusted to increase the respective tariff rates from an additional 10 percent ad valorem to an additional 25 percent ad valorem.\n- Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended in the second sentence by deleting “and” before “(k)”; replacing “11:59 p.m. eastern standard time on December 31, 2025” after (k) with “12:01 a.m. eastern time on March 12, 2025”; and inserting before the period at the end: “, and (l) on or after 12:01 a.m. on March 12, 2025, at a revised rate of an additional 25 percent ad valorem rate, from all countries except from Russia.”\n- The first two sentences of clause 1 of Proclamation 9980 are revised to read as follows:\n“In order to establish increases in the duty rate on imports of certain derivative articles, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in Annex I and Annex II to this proclamation.  Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, all imports of derivative aluminum articles specified in Annex I to this proclamation shall be subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty, and all imports of derivative steel articles specified in Annex II to this proclamation shall be subject to an additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty, with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, as follows:  (i) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 8, 2020, these rates of duty, which are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported derivative aluminum articles or steel articles, shall apply to imports of derivative aluminum articles described in Annex I to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the Mexico, and to imports of derivative steel articles described in Annex II to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea;

    "content": "Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump took decisive action to protect critical American industries by restoring a 25% tariff on steel imports and elevating the tariff to 25% on aluminum imports — building on the successful tariffs from his first term, which have since been undermined by loopholes and exemptions. The moves were quickly met with praise from industry, unions, and lawmakers: Steel Manufacturers Association President Philip K. Bell: “The steel industry in America faces serious threats from foreign actors that seek to destroy domestic production. China and other countries routinely violate trade laws and dump heavily subsidized steel products into the United States at the expense of American workers. By imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel imports, President Trump is leveling the playing field for American manufacturers and workers and helping America defeat direct threats to our jobs.” United Steelworkers President David McCall: “Our union welcomes President Donald Trump’s efforts to contain the global overcapacity that has for too long enabled bad actors like China to flood the global market with its unfairly traded products, resulting in surging imports into the United States, especially from Mexico.” Aluminum Association President Charles Johnson: “We appreciate President Trump’s continued focus on strong trade actions to support the aluminum industry in the United States. During his first term the president was early to recognize the genuine threat that non-market actors pose to U.S. manufacturing industries like ours … Today, there is not enough smelting capacity in the United States to supply the growing aluminum industry with the input materials it needs.” American Iron and Steel Institute President Kevin Dempsey: “We look forward to working closely with the President and his administration to implement a robust and reinvigorated trade agenda to address the many foreign market-distorting policies and practices that create an unlevel playing field for American steelmakers.” American Primary Aluminum Association President Mark Duffy: “Today is a great day for the U.S. aluminum industry. Unfair trade practices have devastated the domestic aluminum industry and President Trump’s actions today will protect thousands of American workers and their families.” Coalition for a Prosperous America Chairman Zach Mottl: “President Trump’s decision to implement global tariffs is a critical step toward restoring stability to American industry, safeguarding domestic production, and ensuring these critical sectors are not harmed by a surge of imports. The only way to rebuild domestic industrial capacity is through strong and enforceable trade policies, and these tariffs are a major step in the right direction.” Nucor Corporation President Leon Topalian: “Nucor strongly commends the actions taken today by President Trump to reimpose tariffs on all steel imports. America’s national security depends on a robust and healthy American steel industry, which continues to be harmed by massive global steel overcapacity and the resulting surge of illegally dumped and subsidized imports from around the world. Many of our trading partners have taken advantage of our open market for far too long and have intentionally circumvented our trade laws or allowed other bad actors to transship illegally dumped and subsidized steel. The President’s actions will help level the playing field for American steel producers.” Energy Fair Trade Coalition Executive Director Bret Manley: “President Trump’s bold leadership will strengthen the backbone of America – our steel and aluminum industry. E-FTC is proud to support initiatives that will level the playing field, foster domestic job growth, and promote fair reciprocal trade.” Century Aluminum Company CEO Jesse Gary: “We strongly support today’s Executive Order from President Donald J. Trump imposing a 25% tariff to stop the flood of aluminum imports into the United States. President Trump’s decisive action will protect national security and help level the playing field for America’s aluminum workers. On behalf of our employees, I thank President Trump for putting America first and strengthening the Section 232 tariffs, which will help drive the resurgence of domestic aluminum production.” Lowell Iron and Steel Company President Dennis Scanell: “The tariffs, thank God they’re coming … Maybe this evens the playing field for us, but this hits right at home. There’s no way we can compete with Canada.” America First Works: “President Trump promised to put America First and make our nation wealthy again; that is exactly what tariffs do. In his first term, President Trump’s bold trade policies created over 4,000 new American jobs and higher wages for hardworking patriots. Foreign nations will no longer be able to take advantage of the United States. If they don’t like the tariffs, they can come to the table and make a deal. In fact, that is what President Trump does best. China will no longer exploit trade loopholes to undermine American workers. Now is the time to stand strong, fight for fair trade, and put America FIRST where it belongs!” Sen. Jim Banks (R-IN): “Too many politicians in Washington take our domestic steel industry for granted. That hurts our workers and disrespects our history.” Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA): “If you have a high tariff on our product, and we have a low tariff on your product, we ought to level them out. That just seems fair to me.” Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KS): “President Trump is a leader who brokers deals that put AMERICAN workers first. The days of unfair, one-sided trade deals that let foreigners take advantage of our country are over. The sky is not falling. @POTUS is protecting our Steel and Aluminum industry workers — and in the end, America will have the upper hand. As it should be.” Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC): “President Trump’s approach to tariffs is designed with the long-term benefits of American consumers and national security in mind. By prioritizing fair trade policies and a balanced approach to tariffs, we’ll secure the economic prosperity of American workers across the country.” Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL): “The media is in full meltdown mode after President Trump imposed duties and retaliatory tariffs this week on countries who have been ripping us off for decades. Both aluminum and steel are critical to our national security — and we make some of the best in the world right here at home. President Trump’s strategic tariffs will strengthen and revitalize our nation’s economy by making sure our trade deals are fair to taxpayers and the American worker.” Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN): “President @realDonaldTrump is a master negotiator, especially when it comes to tariffs. Don’t just take my word for it — even Biden’s own commerce secretary admitted that the tariffs President Trump placed on foreign steel and aluminum during his first term were effective.” Chairwoman Lisa McClain (R-MI): “Millions of Americans are cheering for @POTUS’s tariff negotiations. He has proven his effectiveness in this arena time and time again. This will be no different. He is sending a message to the world. Compete fairly, or pay the price.” Rep. Jason Smith (R-MO): “President Trump is wasting no time moving forward with his America First trade policy. The days of the United States allowing our trading partners to steam roll us are over. President Trump successfully used tariffs in the past to grow our economy and protect American jobs. He imposed steel and aluminum tariffs in 2018, and now he is eliminating exceptions countries like China have used to circumvent them. I look forward to continuing to work with @POTUS to put America First and hold our trading partners accountable.” Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-GA): “President Trump is sending a loud and clear message: America is DONE letting foreign countries undercut our economy. Once again, he’s delivering on his promise to PUT AMERICA FIRST!” Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-FL): “President Trump is ABSOLUTELY RIGHT to tariff & combat Communist #China!” Rep. Diana Harshbarger (R-TN): “Unfair trade practices have led to our nation being on the wrong end of too many bad deals. That’s coming to an end. President Trump is taking action to protect America’s steel and aluminum industries with his latest executive order, continuing to put America first.” Rep. Dan Meuser (R-PA): “President @realDonaldTrump is taking action to protect the American steel industry by closing loopholes that allow other countries to bypass U.S. tariffs through Mexico and Canada. This move will strengthen domestic production and encourage critical investment in U.S. Steel.” Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-FL): “Trading with the United States is a privilege, not a right. President Trump’s America First trade policy will advance our priorities abroad and grow prosperity at home!” Rep. Keith Self (R-TX): “President Trump KEEPS HIS PROMISES! @realDonaldTrump is delivering on his promise to rebalance trade from unfair foreign competition. In the Golden Age, we are building a stronger America.”"

Trump signed proclamations to close existing loopholes and exemptions to restore a true 25% tariff on steel and elevate the tariff to 25% on aluminum.\n- President Trump is taking action to protect America’s critical steel and aluminum industries, which have been harmed by unfair trade practices and global excess capacity.\n- President Trump is reinstating the full 25% tariff on steel imports and increasing tariffs on aluminum imports to 25%.\n\nKey reforms include eliminating all alternative agreements, applying strict “melted and poured” standards, expanding tariffs to include key downstream products, terminating all general approved exclusions, and cracking down on tariff misclassification and duty evasion schemes.\n- Key reforms include eliminating all alternative agreements, applying strict “melted and poured” standards, expanding tariffs to include key downstream products, terminating all general approved exclusions, and cracking down on tariff misclassification and duty evasion schemes.\n- The countries of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, the European Union, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom had received exemptions, which prevented the tariffs from being effective.\n\nBy granting exemptions to certain countries, the United States inadvertently created loopholes that were exploited by China and others with excess steel and aluminum capacity, undermining the purpose of these exemptions.\n- By granting exemptions to certain countries, the United States inadvertently created loopholes that were exploited by China and others with excess steel and aluminum capacity, undermining the purpose of these exemptions.\n- The President is exercising his authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to adjust imports of steel and aluminum to protect our national security.This statute provides the President with authority to adjust imports being brought into the United States in quantities or under circumstances that threaten to impair national security.In March 2018, President Trump invoked authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. § 1862) to impose 25% tariffs on steel imports and 10% tariffs on aluminum.  These measures were remarkably effective in supporting recovery and reinvestment in the American steel industry and saved the domestic primary aluminum industry from total collapse. But exemptions and loopholes have permitted evasion of the tariffs and weakened the effectiveness of the program.\n\nThe reinvigorated Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum will support the program’s original objective of revitalizing the domestic steel and aluminum industries and achieving sustainable capacity utilization of at least 80%.\n- This statute provides the President with authority to adjust imports being brought into the United States in quantities or under circumstances that threaten to impair national security.\n- In March 2018, President Trump invoked authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. § 1862) to impose 25% tariffs on steel imports and 10% tariffs on aluminum.  These measures were remarkably effective in supporting recovery and reinvestment in the American steel industry and saved the domestic primary aluminum industry from total collapse.

But since 2019, the aluminum capacity utilization has once again seen a steady decline, falling from 61% to 55% between 2019 and 2023.\n- The United States does not want to be in a position where it would be unable to meet demand for national defense and critical infrastructure in a national emergency.\nSTRENGTHENING AMERICA’S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY: President Trump’s decision to close existing loopholes and exemptions will strengthen United States’ steel and aluminum industries.\n- In his first term, President Trump imposed Section 232 tariffs to protect the American steel and aluminum industries from unfair foreign competition.\n- The steel tariffs that President Trump implemented led to thousands of jobs gained and higher wages in the metals industry.These tariffs were hailed as a “boon” for Minnesota’s iron ore industry, with state officials crediting tariffs for bolstering the local economy. Steel and aluminum imports drastically decreased under President Trump, falling by nearly a third from 2016 to 2020.\n\nThe tariffs led to a wave in investment across the United States, with more than $10 billion committed to build new mills.\n- These tariffs were hailed as a “boon” for Minnesota’s iron ore industry, with state officials crediting tariffs for bolstering the local economy.\n- Steel and aluminum imports drastically decreased under President Trump, falling by nearly a third from 2016 to 2020.\n- The tariffs led to a wave in investment across the United States, with more than $10 billion committed to build new mills.\n- It was recently announced that Hyundai Steel is actively considering building a steel plant in the United States.\n- U.S. steelmakers, including the American Iron and Steel Institute and the Steel Manufacturers Association, have praised President Trump’s America First trade policy.\nTARIFFS WORK: Studies have repeatedly shown that contrary to public rhetoric, tariffs can be an effective tool for achieving economic and strategic objectives.\n- A 2024 study on the effects of President Trump’s tariffs in his first Administration found that they “strengthened the U.S. economy,” and “led to significant reshoring” in industries like manufacturing and steel production.\n- A 2023 report by the U.S. International Trade Commission that analyzed the effects of Section 232 and 301 tariffs on more than $300 billion of U.S. imports found that the tariffs reduced imports from China, effectively stimulated more U.S. production of the tariffed goods, with very minor effects on prices.\n- According to the Economic Policy Institute, the tariffs implemented by President Trump during his first Administration “clearly show[ed] no correlation with inflation” and only had a temporary effect on overall price levels.\n- An analysis from the Atlantic Council found that “tariffs would create new incentives for US consumers to buy US-made products.”\n- Former Biden Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen affirmed last year that tariffs do not raise prices: “I don’t believe that American consumers will see any meaningful increase in the prices that they face.”\n- A 2024 economic analysis found that a global tariff of 10% would grow the economy by $728 billion, create 2.8 million jobs, and increase real household incomes by 5.7%.\n"

    "content": "BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION\n1. On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on the Secretary’s investigation into the effect of imports of steel mill articles (steel articles) on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (section 232).  The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that steel articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.\n2. In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary’s finding that steel articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705 (as amended by clause 8 of Proclamation 9711 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States)), are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of steel articles by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries.  Proclamation 9705 further stated that any country with which the United States has a security relationship is welcome to discuss alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and that country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that the President determines that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on steel articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require.\n3. In Proclamation 9705, I also directed the Secretary to monitor imports of steel articles and inform me of any circumstances that in the Secretary‘s opinion might indicate the need for further action under Section 232, as amended, with respect to such imports.  Pursuant to Proclamation 9705, the Secretary was authorized to provide relief from the additional duties, based on a request from a directly affected party located in the United States, for any steel article determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality, or based upon specific national security considerations.\nIn subsequent proclamations, I noted the conclusion of discussions or the agreement on certain measures with the Argentine Republic (Argentina), Proclamation 9759 of May 31, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States); the Commonwealth of Australia (Australia), Proclamation 9759; the Federative Republic of Brazil (Brazil), Proclamation 9759; Proclamation 10064 of August 28, 2020 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States); Canada, Proclamation 9894 of May 19, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States; the United Mexican States (Mexico), Proclamation 9894; and the Republic of Korea (South Korea), Proclamation 9740 of April 30, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States).  President Biden noted the conclusion of discussions or the agreement on certain measures with the European Union (EU) on behalf of its member countries, Proclamation 10328 of December 27, 2021 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States); Proclamation 10691 of December 28, 2023 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States); Japan, Proclamation 10356 of March 31, 2022 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States); and the United Kingdom (UK), Proclamation 10406 of May 31, 2022 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), on alternative ways to address the threat to the national security.  In addition, then-President Biden acknowledged the close relationship with Ukraine and exempted steel articles from Ukraine from the tariff. Proclamation 10403 of May 27, 2022 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States); Proclamation 10588 of May 31, 2023 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States); Proclamation 10771 of May 31, 2024 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States).  In Proclamation 10783 of July 10, 2024 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), President Biden noted that imports of steel articles from Mexico had increased significantly as compared to their levels at the time of Proclamation 9894.  Accordingly, he implemented a melt and pour requirement for imports of steel articles that are products of Mexico and increased the section 232 duty rate for imports of steel articles and derivative steel articles that are products of Mexico that are melted and poured in a country other than Mexico, Canada, or the United States.\n4. The Secretary has informed me that the initial 25 percent ad valorem tariff imposed by Proclamation 9705 has been an effective means of reducing imports, encouraging investment and expansion of production by domestic steel producers, and mitigating the threatened impairment of U.S. national security.  Following the initial imposition of 25 percent ad valorem tariffs, the U.S. steel capacity utilization rate increased to above 80 percent.\n5. The Secretary has also informed me that, notwithstanding the impact of the tariff imposed by Proclamation 9705, imports of steel articles from certain countries exempted from the tariff or subject to alternative agreements have increased significantly, while excess capacity in the global steel industry has begun to increase again in recent years.  For example, imports from Canada increased 18 percent since Canada was excluded from the section 232 tariffs.  According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), global steel excess capacity is projected to reach approximately 630 million metric tons by 2026, more than total steel production in all OECD countries.  At the same time, exports of steel from the People’s Republic of China (China) have recently surged, exceeding 114 million metric tons through November 2024 while displacing production in other countries and forcing them to export greater volumes of steel articles and derivative steel articles to the United States.\n6. Total steel imports as a share of U.S. consumption increased significantly in 2024, reaching nearly 30 percent, similar to the import share of U.S. consumption at the time the Secretary issued his January 11, 2018, report.  Imports from countries with which the United States has reached alternative agreements have increased significantly as a share of total imports, from 74 percent in 2018 to 82 percent in 2024, while imports from countries subject to quantitative restrictions remain elevated regardless of changing U.S. demand conditions and the substantial investments made to expand the capabilities of the domestic industry.  Increasing and persistently high import volumes from countries exempted from the duties or subject to other alternative agreements like quotas and tariff-rate quotas have captured the benefit of U.S. demand at the domestic industry’s expense and transmitted harmful effects onto the domestic industry.  As steel import market share has increased, the domestic industry’s performance has been depressed, resulting in capacity utilization rates persistently lower than the 80 percent target level highlighted in the Secretary’s report.\n7. The Secretary has informed me that imports of steel articles from Canada and Mexico have increased significantly to levels that once again threaten to impair U.S. national security.  Volumes from both Canada and Mexico increased overall, from 7.77 million metric tons in 2020 to 9.14 million metric tons in 2024.  Imports have also surged in excess of historical norms of trade across numerous key product lines, such as long reinforcing bars, which have experienced import increases of 1,678 percent from Mexico and 564 percent from Canada.  These surges have occurred while authorities in those countries have supported otherwise uncompetitive producers with subsidies and other interventions that have exacerbated the global excess capacity crisis.  In addition, increasing import volumes and including Mexico’s imports from China, support a conclusion that there is transshipment or further processing of steel mill articles from countries that remain subject to the additional ad valorem tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705, or from countries seeking to evade quantitative restrictions.\n8. The Secretary has also informed me that alternative agreements with trading partners including Australia, the members of the EU, Japan, and the United Kingdom have been less effective in eliminating the threatened impairment of U.S. national security than the additional ad valorem tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705.  As a result, imports of steel articles from these countries have increased as a share of total U.S. steel imports from 18.6 percent in 2020 to 20.7 percent in 2024.  In addition, from 2022 to 2024, imports from countries subject to quotas (Argentina, Brazil, and South Korea) increased by approximately 1.5 million metric tons, even as U.S. demand declined by more than 6.1 million tons during the period.  Argentina has continued to export steel to the United States at unsustainable quantities, especially a recent surge of semifinished products. Furthermore, Argentina’s lack of data transparency has continued to be of concern for the United States.  From official trade statistics released by Argentina, it is difficult to assess the levels of steel being imported from places like China and Russia, and other potential sources of excess capacity. Brazilian imports from countries with meaningful levels of overcapacity, specifically China have grown tremendously in recent years, more than tripling since the institution of this quota arrangement.\n9. At the same time, these alternative agreements have not resulted in sufficient action by these trading partners to address non-market excess capacity caused primarily by China, or sufficient cooperation by these trading partners on issues like trade remedies and customs matters or monitoring bilateral steel trade.  Some countries have also welcomed steel industry investments from non-market producers in countries like China seeking to exploit the agreements to obtain preferential access to the U.S. market.  The agreements have therefore been detrimental to U.S. steel production and national security.\n10. The Secretary has informed me of similar problems with respect to the temporary exemption for imports of steel articles and derivative steel articles from Ukraine.  Rather than supporting the Ukrainian steel industry and alleviating the economic harm caused by the ongoing conflict, the benefits of this temporary exemption have accrued primarily to producers in EU member countries, which have significantly increased duty-free exports to the U.S. market of steel articles processed from Ukrainian semi-finished steel.  Since 2021, imports from Ukraine have remained steady at 0.5 percent of total U.S. imports, while imports from the European Union have increased 11.2 percent to 14.8 percent.  As a result of the temporary exemption, these imports enter the U.S. market subject to neither the ad valorem tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705, nor the tariff-rate-quota system applicable to other imports of steel articles from EU producers as proclaimed in Proclamation 10328.  This has facilitated evasion of both the section 232 measures and of antidumping duties that would be paid if the finished products were imported directly from Ukraine.\n11. The Secretary has informed me that producers in countries that remain subject to the program have continued to evade the measures by processing covered steel articles into additional downstream steel derivative products that were not included in the additional ad valorem tariffs proclaimed in Proclamation 9705 and Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 2020 (Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and Derivative Steel Articles Into the United States).  Imports of products such as fabricated structural steel, prestressed concrete strand, and others, have increased significantly since the issuance of Proclamation 9705 and Proclamation 9980, eroding the domestic industry’s customer base and resulting in depressed demand for steel articles produced in the United States.\n12. The Secretary has also informed me of certain ongoing challenges with the product exclusion process authorized by Proclamation 9705, Proclamation 9777 of August 29, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), and Proclamation 9980 and implemented by subsequent regulations.  This process has resulted in exclusions for a significant volume of imports, in a manner that undermines the purpose of the section 232 measures and threatens to impair national security.  Certain general approved exclusions remain in effect for entire tariff lines of steel articles, notwithstanding the domestic industry’s potential to produce many excluded products.\n13. I determine that these developments and modifications to the tariffs announced in Proclamation 9705 have undermined the program’s national security objectives by preventing the domestic steel industry from achieving sustained production capacity utilization of at least 80 percent, as determined necessary in the Secretary’s report of January 11, 2018.  I also determine that they have failed to achieve their articulated objectives.  As a result, I determine that they have resulted in significantly increasing imports of steel articles that threaten to impair the national security.\n14. In light of the Secretary’s findings regarding the alternative agreements with South Korea proclaimed in Proclamation 9740; Argentina, Australia, and Brazil proclaimed in Proclamation 9759; Canada and Mexico proclaimed in Proclamation 9894; EU countries proclaimed in Proclamation 10328; Japan proclaimed in Proclamation 10356; and the United Kingdom proclaimed in Proclamation 10406, I have revisited the determinations in these proclamations.  In my judgment, the arrangements with these countries have failed to provide effective, long-term alternative means to address these countries’ contribution to the threatened impairment to the national security by restraining steel articles exports to the United States from each of them, limiting transshipment and surges and distorted pricing, and discouraging excess steel capacity and excess steel production. Thus, I have determined that steel articles imports from these countries threaten to impair the national security, and I have decided that it is necessary to terminate these arrangements as of March 12, 2025.  As of that date, all imports of steel articles and derivative steel articles from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, EU countries, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom shall be subject to the additional ad valorem tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705 with respect to steel articles and Proclamation 9980 with respect to derivative steel articles.  In my judgment, these modifications are necessary to address the significantly increasing share of imports of steel articles and derivative steel articles from these sources, which threaten to impair U.S. national security.  Replacing the alternative agreements with the additional ad valorem tariffs will be a more robust and effective means of ensuring that the objectives articulated in the Secretary’s January 11, 2018, report and subsequent proclamations are achieved.\n15. For the same reasons, I have also revisited the determinations in Proclamation 10403, Proclamation 10558, and Proclamation 10771.  In my judgment, the arrangement with Ukraine has failed to provide effective, long-term alternative means to address Ukraine’s contribution to the threatened impairment to our national security by restraining steel articles exports to the United States from Ukraine, limiting transshipment and surges, and discouraging excess steel capacity and excess steel production. Thus, I have determined that steel articles imports from Ukraine threaten to impair the national security and have determined that it is necessary to terminate the temporary exemption for imports of steel articles and derivative steel articles from Ukraine as proclaimed in Proclamation 10403, Proclamation 10558, and Proclamation 10771.  In my judgment, terminating this exemption will prevent abuses that have resulted in significantly increasing imports from sources other than Ukraine, will prevent evasion of antidumping duties, and will support the domestic steel industry without harming Ukraine’s economic recovery.\n16. In light of the information provided by the Secretary that significantly increasing imports of certain derivative steel articles have depressed demand for steel articles produced by domestic steel producers, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate in light of U.S. national security interests to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705 and Proclamation 9980 to apply to additional derivative steel articles.  As of March 12, 2025, the additional derivative steel articles covered by this proclamation, as set out in Annex I to this proclamation, shall be subject to the ad valorem duties proclaimed in Proclamation 9705 and Proclamation 9980, except for derivative steel articles processed in another country from steel articles that were melted and poured in the United States.  For any derivative steel article identified in Annex I that is not in Chapter 73 of the HTSUS, the additional ad valorem duty shall apply only to the steel content of the derivative steel article.  The Secretary shall publish a notice in the Federal Register to this effect, including Annex I to this proclamation.\n17. The Secretary has informed me that his findings with regard to the product exclusion process present circumstances that in the Secretary’s opinion indicate the need for further action by the President under section 232.  Accordingly, as of the date of this proclamation the Secretary is no longer authorized to provide relief from the additional duties set forth in clause 2 of Proclamation 9705 for any steel article determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or a satisfactory quality or based on specific national security determinations, and the product exclusion process as authorized in clause 3 of Proclamation 9705, clause 1 of Proclamation 9777, and clause 2 of Proclamation 9980 is terminated, effective immediately.  I have determined that terminating product exclusions is necessary to ensure that overly broad exclusions do not allow high volumes of imports to undermine the objectives articulated in the Secretary’s January 11, 2018, report and relevant subsequent proclamations.  This change will also relieve the administrative burden that the process has created.  Following this proclamation, and subject to any restrictions set forth in or pursuant to other provisions of applicable law, imports of any steel article or derivative steel article from any source and in any quantity will be available to U.S. importers, provided that the additional ad valorem tariffs are paid upon entry or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption.\n18. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to take action to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives if the President concurs with the Secretary’s finding that the article is being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.\n19. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the president to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.\n20.  The United States will monitor the implementation and effectiveness of these actions in addressing our national security needs, and I may revisit this determination, as appropriate.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, and section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:\n- (1) The provisions of Proclamation 9740 with respect to imports of steel articles from South Korea;

(FCPA) has been systematically, and to a steadily increasing degree, stretched beyond proper bounds and abused in a manner that harms the interests of the United States.  Current FCPA enforcement impedes the United States’ foreign policy objectives and therefore implicates the President’s Article II authority over foreign affairs.     The President’s foreign policy authority is inextricably linked with the global economic competitiveness of American companies.  American national security depends in substantial part on the United States and its companies gaining strategic business advantages whether in critical minerals, deep-water ports, or other key infrastructure or assets.      But overexpansive and unpredictable FCPA enforcement against American citizens and businesses — by our own Government — for routine business practices in other nations not only wastes limited prosecutorial resources that could be dedicated to preserving American freedoms, but actively harms American economic competitiveness and, therefore, national security.      It is therefore the policy of my Administration to preserve the Presidential authority to conduct foreign affairs and advance American economic and national security by eliminating excessive barriers to American commerce abroad.      Sec. 2.  Policy of Enforcement Discretion.  (a)  For a period of 180 days following the date of this order, the Attorney General shall review guidelines and policies governing investigations and enforcement actions under the FCPA.  During the review period, the Attorney General shall:          (i)    cease initiation of any new FCPA investigations or enforcement actions, unless the Attorney General determines that an individual exception should be made;          (ii)   review in detail all existing FCPA investigations or enforcement actions and take appropriate action with respect to such matters to restore proper bounds on FCPA enforcement and preserve Presidential foreign policy prerogatives; and          (iii)  issue updated guidelines or policies, as appropriate, to adequately promote the President’s Article II authority to conduct foreign affairs and prioritize American interests, American economic competitiveness with respect to other nations, and the efficient use of Federal law enforcement resources.     (b)  The Attorney General may extend such review period for an additional 180 days as the Attorney General determines appropriate.     (c)  FCPA investigations and enforcement actions initiated or continued after the revised guidelines or policies are issued under subsection (a) of this section:          (i)   shall be governed by such guidelines or policies; and          (ii)  must be specifically authorized by the Attorney General.     (d)  After the revised guidelines or policies are issued under subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General shall determine whether additional actions, including remedial measures with respect to inappropriate past FCPA investigations and enforcement actions, are warranted and shall take any such appropriate actions or, if Presidential action is required, recommend such actions to the President.     Sec. 3.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.     Sec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:           (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or           (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.      (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.      (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.       THE WHITE HOUSE,    February 10, 2025."

One such group is the Soros-backed Mississippi Center for Justice, which advocates for “racial and economic justice,” targets religious liberty, and assists illegal immigrants seeking to skirt our nation’s laws. Another is The Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia, whose board features senior left-wing officials and has lobbied hundreds of times for more welfare spending.\n- CFBP threatened banks for refusing to lend to illegal immigrants.\n- CFPB targeted a Chicago small business after it complained about the city’s rampant crime.\n- CFPB was accused of mining American citizens’ personal financial information — with a 2017 inspector general’s report raising significant concerns about its data security.\n- CFPB granted itself broad new powers in the waning hours of the lame duck Biden administration. Described as classic “government overreach,” the agency gave itself the authority to regulate Americans’ checking accounts by dictating government price controls and unilaterally buried $50 billion in medical debt.\nUnder the administration of President Donald J.

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:     Section 1.  Policy.  An irrational campaign against plastic straws has resulted in major cities, States, and businesses banning the use or automatic inclusion of plastic straws with beverages.  Plastic straws are often replaced by paper straws, which are nonfunctional, use chemicals that may carry risks to human health, are more expensive to produce than plastic straws, and often force users to use multiple straws.  Additionally, paper straws sometimes come individually wrapped in plastic, undermining the environmental argument for their use.It is therefore the policy of the United States to end the use of paper straws.      Sec. 2.  Purchases of Paper Straws by the Federal Government.  (a)  The heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all appropriate action to eliminate the procurement of paper straws and otherwise ensure that paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings.(b)  Agencies shall take appropriate action to eliminate policies designed to disfavor plastic straws issued to further Executive Order 14057 of December 8, 2021 (Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability), which I revoked on January 20, 2025.(c)  Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, in coordination with relevant agencies, shall issue a National Strategy to End the Use of Paper Straws.  This strategy shall address:(i)    The elimination of all policies within the executive branch designed to disfavor plastic straws;(ii)   Contract policies and terms with entities, including States, that ban or penalize plastic straw purchase or use; and(iii)  All other available tools to achieve the policy of this order nationwide.     Sec. 3. General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.  (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.       THE WHITE HOUSE,    February 10, 2025.\n"

    "content": "President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru held their first official meeting today in Washington, D.C., where they affirmed their determination to pursue a new golden age for U.S.-Japan relations that upholds a free and open Indo-Pacific and brings peace and prosperity to a violent and disorderly world.  U.S.-Japan Cooperation for Peace The two leaders expressed their shared desire for bilateral security and defense cooperation under the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security to grow stronger than ever, and emphasized that the U.S.-Japan Alliance remains the cornerstone of peace, security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. Japan reiterated its unwavering commitment to fundamentally reinforce its own defense capabilities, which the United States welcomed. The United States underscored its unwavering commitment to the defense of Japan, using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. The two leaders reaffirmed that Article V of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security applies to the Senkaku Islands, and reiterated their strong opposition to any action that seeks to undermine Japan’s longstanding and peaceful administration of the Senkaku Islands. In line with the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and the U.S.-Japan Guidelines for Defense Cooperation, Japan reaffirmed its role in maintaining peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region by seamlessly responding to any situation from peacetime to contingencies. This has been further enabled by Japan’s 2015 Legislation for Peace and Security, which enhances U.S.-Japan Alliance deterrence and response capabilities. In order to address an increasingly severe and complex security environment, the two leaders confirmed that they intend to further strengthen U.S.-Japan deterrence and response capabilities by enhancing defense and security cooperation, including by upgrading the respective command and control frameworks of U.S. and Japanese forces, increasing bilateral presence in Japan’s Southwest Islands, increasing readiness through more realistic training and exercises, further enhancing U.S. extended deterrence, and promoting defense equipment and technology cooperation, including co-production, co-development, and co-sustainment that bolsters allied supply chains and strengthens U.S. and Japanese defense industrial capacity, including maritime. The United States and Japan intend to continue their strong partnership in civil space and on aeronautics, science, and human exploration, including on the upcoming Crew-10 mission to the International Space Station that includes U.S. and Japanese astronauts as well as lunar surface exploration on future Artemis missions. The United States and Japan also intend to expand bilateral security cooperation in cyberspace by leveraging new technologies such as artificial intelligence and secure and resilient cloud services to deepen information-sharing. The United States welcomed Japan’s commitment, underpinned by a favorable trend of its defense budget increase, to building capabilities by FY 2027 to consolidate its primary responsibility for defending Japan, and, building on this significant foundation, to fundamentally reinforcing its defense capabilities beyond FY 2027.   In order to maintain deterrence and mitigate the impact on local communities, the two leaders confirmed the vital importance of the steady implementation of the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan in accordance with the Okinawa Consolidation Plan, including the construction of the Futenma Replacement Facility at Henoko and the return of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma.   The two leaders instructed their foreign and defense ministers to convene a Security Consultative Committee (SCC: “2+2”) meeting at an early date to implement the above-mentioned cooperation in an expeditious manner. U.S.-Japan Cooperation for Growth and Prosperity The two leaders affirmed that bilateral economic cooperation, including on economic security, forms an indispensable part of Alliance cooperation. As close economic partners, the United States and Japan provide the largest amount of foreign direct investment and create high quality jobs in each other’s countries. Industries of both countries continue to play a vital role for each other’s supply chains.To chart an unwavering course for strengthening economic ties and elevating the economic partnership to the next level, the two leaders will seek to: promote business opportunities and significantly increase bilateral investment and employment; strengthen their industrial bases and collaborate to lead the world in developing critical technologies such as AI, quantum computing, and leading-edge semiconductors; enhance efforts to counter and build resilience against economic coercion; and jointly promote growth in the Indo-Pacific region underpinned by a free and fair economic order. They also resolved to continue discussions on aligning policies to further promote and protect critical and sensitive technologies, including through export controls, and to enhance supply chain resilience. With a shared commitment to the integrity of travel systems that underpin economic prosperity, they intend to strengthen efforts to vet travelers and routinely and securely share information to combat technology theft, travel by criminals, and illegal immigration. The two leaders announced their intention to strengthen energy security by unleashing the United States’ affordable and reliable energy and natural resources, and by increasing exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Japan in a mutually beneficial manner. They also welcomed efforts to diversify critical minerals supply chains and to collaborate on developing and deploying cutting-edge small modular reactor and other advanced nuclear reactor technology. The two leaders instructed their relevant ministers in charge to strengthen U.S.-Japan economic cooperation to achieve these shared goals. U.S.-Japan Coordination in the Indo-Pacific The two leaders shared views on the severe and complex security environment and expressed their determination to continuously cooperate to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific. As part of such cooperation, the two leaders intend to advance multilayered and aligned cooperation among like-minded countries, including Japan-Australia-India-U.S. (Quad), Japan-U.S.-Republic of Korea (ROK), Japan-U.S.-Australia, and Japan-U.S.-Philippines. Through these relationships, the United States, Japan, and like-minded partners can deliver high quality infrastructure investments in the region, including the deployment of Open Radio Access Networks in third countries. The two leaders reiterated their strong opposition to any attempts by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to change the status quo by force or coercion in the East China Sea. The two leaders reaffirmed their strong opposition to the PRC’s unlawful maritime claims, militarization of reclaimed features, and threatening and provocative activities in the South China Sea. The two leaders emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity for the international community. They encouraged the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues, and opposed any attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion. The two leaders also expressed support for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in international organizations. The two leaders expressed their serious concerns over and the need to address the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK’s) nuclear and missile programs and reaffirmed their resolute commitment to the complete denuclearization of the DPRK. Both countries underscored the need to deter and counter the DPRK’s malicious cyber activities and the DPRK’s increasing military cooperation with Russia. In addition, both countries affirmed the importance of the Japan-U.S.-ROK trilateral partnership in responding to the DPRK and upholding regional peace and prosperity. Japan reiterated its determination to achieve an immediate resolution of the abductions issue, which the United States supported.  Invitation to Visit Japan President Trump accepted an invitation from Prime Minister Ishiba for an official visit to Japan in the near future."

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,    I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the International Criminal Court (ICC), as established by the Rome Statute, has engaged in illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.  The ICC has, without a legitimate basis, asserted jurisdiction over and opened preliminary investigations concerning personnel of the United States and certain of its allies, including Israel, and has further abused its power by issuing baseless arrest warrants targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant.  The ICC has no jurisdiction over the United States or Israel, as neither country is party to the Rome Statute or a member of the ICC.  Neither country has ever recognized the ICC’s jurisdiction, and both nations are thriving democracies with militaries that strictly adhere to the laws of war.  The ICC’s recent actions against Israel and the United States set a dangerous precedent, directly endangering current and former United States personnel, including active service members of the Armed Forces, by exposing them to harassment, abuse, and possible arrest.  This malign conduct in turn threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States Government and our allies, including Israel.  Furthermore, in 2002, the Congress enacted the American Servicemembers’ Protection Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7421 et seq.) to protect United States military personnel, United States officials, and officials and military personnel of certain allied countries against criminal prosecution by an international criminal court to which the United States is not party, stating, “In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of the United States to the risk of international criminal prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the President and other senior elected and appointed officials of the United States Government may be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court.” (22 U.S.C. 7421(9)).      The United States unequivocally opposes and expects our allies to oppose any ICC actions against the United States, Israel, or any other ally of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction.  The United States remains committed to accountability and to the peaceful cultivation of international order, but the ICC and parties to the Rome Statute must respect the decisions of the United States and other countries not to subject their personnel to the ICC’s jurisdiction, consistent with their respective sovereign prerogatives.     The United States will impose tangible and significant consequences on those responsible for the ICC’s transgressions, some of which may include the blocking of property and assets, as well as the suspension of entry into the United States of ICC officials, employees, and agents, as well as their immediate family members, as their entry into our Nation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.    I therefore determine that any effort by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute protected persons, as defined in section 8(d) of this order, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to address that threat.  I hereby determine and order:     Section 1.  (a)  All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:(i)   the person listed in the Annex to this order; and(ii)  any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General:(A)  to have directly engaged in any effort by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute a protected person without consent of that person’s country of nationality;(B)  to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any activity in subsection (a)(ii)(A) of this section or any person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or(C)  to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.(b)  The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order.    Sec. 2.  I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to address the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.     Sec. 3.  The prohibitions in section 1(a) of this order include:     (a)  the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order; and     (b)  the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.    Sec. 4.  The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1 of this order, as well as immediate family members of such aliens, or aliens determined by the Secretary of State to be employed by, or acting as an agent of, the ICC, would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except where the Secretary of State determines that the entry of the person into the United States would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when the Secretary of State so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person’s entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives.  In exercising this responsibility, the Secretary of State shall consult with the Secretary of Homeland Security on matters related to admissibility or inadmissibility within the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security.  Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).  The Secretary of State shall have the responsibility for implementing this section pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Secretary of State has established or may establish pursuant to Proclamation 8693.    Sec. 5.  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a report on additional persons that should be included within the scope of section 1 of this order.    Sec. 6.  (a)  Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.(b)  Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.    Sec. 7.  Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.     Sec. 8.  For the purposes of this order:     (a)  the term “person” means an individual or entity;     (b)  the term “entity” means a government or instrumentality of such government, partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;     (c)  the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including a foreign branch, subsidiary, or employee of such entity), or any person lawfully in the United States;     (d)  the term “protected person” means:(i)   any United States person, unless the United States provides formal consent to ICC jurisdiction over that person or becomes a state party to the Rome Statute, including:(A)  current or former members of the Armed Forces of the United States;(B)  current or former elected or appointed officials of the United States Government; and(C)  any other person currently or formerly employed by or working on behalf of the United States Government; and(ii)  any foreign person that is a citizen or lawful resident of an ally of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction over that person or is not a state party to the Rome Statute, including:(A)  current or former members of the armed forces of such ally of the United States;(B)  current or former elected or appointed government officials of such ally of the United States; and(C)  any other person currently or formerly employed by or working on behalf of such a government;     (e)  the term “ally of the United States” means:(i)   a government of a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; or(ii)  a government of a “major non-NATO ally,” as that term is defined by section 2013(7) of the American Servicemembers’ Protection Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7432(7));     (f)  the term “immediate family member” means a spouse or child;     (g)  the term “alien” has the meanings given to the term in section 101(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(3)); and     (h)  the term “foreign person” means a person that is not a United States person.    Sec. 9.  For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to section 1 of this order would render those measures ineffectual.  I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.    Sec. 10.  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order.  The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury.  All executive departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.    Sec. 11.  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).     Sec. 12.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nANNEX\n"

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:     Section 1.  Purpose and Policy.  It is the policy of the United States, and the purpose of this order, to protect the religious freedoms of Americans and end the anti-Christian weaponization of government.  The Founders established a Nation in which people were free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by their government.      For that reason, the United States Constitution enshrines the fundamental right to religious liberty in the First Amendment.  Federal laws like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.), further prohibit government interference with Americans’ rights to exercise their religion.  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.), prohibits religious discrimination in employment while Federal hate-crime laws prohibit offenses committed due to religious animus.     Yet the previous Administration engaged in an egregious pattern of targeting peaceful Christians, while ignoring violent, anti-Christian offenses.  The Biden Department of Justice sought to squelch faith in the public square by bringing Federal criminal charges and obtaining in numerous cases multi-year prison sentences against nearly two dozen peaceful pro-life Christians for praying and demonstrating outside abortion facilities.  Those convicted included a Catholic priest and 75-year-old grandmother, as well as an 87-year-old woman and a father of 11 children who were arrested 18 months after praying and singing hymns outside an abortion facility in Tennessee as a part of a politically motivated prosecution campaign by the Biden Administration.  I rectified this injustice on January 23, 2025, by issuing pardons in these cases.       At the same time, Catholic churches, charities, and pro-life centers sought justice for violence, theft, and arson perpetrated against them, which the Biden Department of Justice largely ignored.  After more than 100 attacks, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning this violence and calling on the Biden Administration to enforce the law.      Then, in 2023, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) memorandum asserted that “radical-traditionalist” Catholics were domestic-terrorism threats and suggested infiltrating Catholic churches as “threat mitigation.”  This later-retracted FBI memorandum cited as support evidence propaganda from highly partisan sources.        The Biden Department of Education sought to repeal religious-liberty protections for faith-based organizations on college campuses.  The Biden Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sought to force Christians to affirm radical transgender ideology against their faith.  And the Biden Department of Health and Human Services sought to drive Christians who do not conform to certain beliefs on sexual orientation and gender identity out of the foster-care system.  The Biden Administration declared March 31, 2024 — Easter Sunday — as “Transgender Day of Visibility.”         In this atmosphere of anti-Christian government, hostility and vandalism against Christian churches and places of worship surged, with the number of such identified acts in 2023 exceeding by more than eight times the number from 2018.  Catholic churches and institutions have been aggressively targeted with hundreds of acts of hostility, violence, and vandalism.          My Administration will not tolerate anti-Christian weaponization of government or unlawful conduct targeting Christians.  The law protects the freedom of Americans and groups of Americans to practice their faith in peace, and my Administration will enforce the law and protect these freedoms.  My Administration will ensure that any unlawful and improper conduct, policies, or practices that target Christians are identified, terminated, and rectified.     Sec. 2.  Establishing a Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias.  (a)  There is hereby established within the Department of Justice the Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias (Task Force).     (b)  The Attorney General shall serve as Chair of the Task Force.     (c)  In addition to the Chair, the Task Force shall consist of the following other members:          (i)     the Secretary of State;          (ii)    the Secretary of the Treasury;          (iii)   the Secretary of Defense;          (iv)    the Secretary of Labor;          (v)     the Secretary of Health and Human Services;          (vi)    the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;          (vii)   the Secretary of Education;          (viii)  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;          (ix)    the Secretary of Homeland Security;          (x)     the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;          (xi)    Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations;          (xii)   the Administrator of the Small Business Administration;          (xiii)  the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation;          (xiv)   the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy;          (xv)    the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency;          (xvi)   the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; and          (xvii)  the heads of such other executive departments, agencies, and offices that the Chair may, from time to time, invite to participate.     Sec. 3.  Task Force Functions.  (a)  The Task Force shall meet as required by the Chair and shall take appropriate action to:          (i)    review the activities of all executive departments and agencies (agencies), including the Department of State, the Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, over the previous Administration and identify any unlawful anti-Christian policies, practices, or conduct by an agency contrary to the purpose and policy of this order;          (ii)   recommend to the head of the relevant agency steps to revoke or terminate any violative policies, practices, or conduct identified under subsection (3)(a)(i) of this section and remedial actions to fulfill the purpose and policy of this order;          (iii)  share information and develop strategies to protect the religious liberties of Americans and advance the purpose and policy of this order;          (iv)   solicit information and ideas from a broad range of individuals and groups, including Americans affected by anti-Christian conduct, faith-based organizations, and State, local, and Tribal governments, in order to ensure that its work is informed by a broad spectrum of ideas and experiences;          (v)    identify deficiencies in existing laws and enforcement and regulatory practices that have contributed to unlawful anti-Christian governmental or private conduct and recommend to the relevant agency head, or recommend to the President, through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, as applicable, appropriate actions that agencies may take to remedy failures to fully enforce the law against acts of anti-Christian hostility, vandalism, and violence; and          (vi)     recommend to the President, through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, any additional Presidential or legislative action necessary to rectify past improper anti-Christian conduct, protect religious liberty, or otherwise fulfill the purpose and policy of this order.     (b)  In order to advise the President regarding its work and assist the President in formulating future policy, the Task Force shall submit to the President, through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy:          (i)    a report within 120 days from the date of this order regarding the Task Force’s initial work;            (ii)   a report within 1 year from the date of this order that summarizes the Task Force’s work; and          (iii)  a final report upon the dissolution of the Task Force.     Sec. 4.  Administration.  (a)  The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, upon the request of the Chair, provide the Task Force with any information required by the Task Force for the purpose of carrying out its functions.     (b)  The Department of Justice shall provide such funding and administrative and technical support as the Task Force may require, to the extent permitted by law and as authorized by existing appropriations.     Sec. 5.  Termination.  The Task Force shall terminate 2 years from the date of this order unless extended by the President.     Sec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.                     THE WHITE HOUSE,    February 6, 2025."

We have to bring it back much stronger.  It’s one of the biggest problems that we’ve had over the last fairly long period of time.  We have to bring it back.\nThomas Jefferson himself once attended Sunday services held in the old House Chamber on the very ground where I stand today, so there could be nothing more beautiful than for us to gather in this majistic place — it is majestic — and reaffirm that America is and will always be “one nation under God.”\nAt every stage of the American story, our country has drawn hope and courage and inspiration from our trust in the Almighty.  Deep in the soul of every patriot is the knowledge that God has a special plan and a glorious mission for America.  And that plan is going to happen.  It’s going to happen.  I hope it happens sooner rather than later.  It’s going to happen.\nAnd it’s His hand that guides us every single step of the way.  And all of you and the things we have to do is to see the defining role that faith and prayer have played in the life of our nation.  And you just have to look at this building, and you can look at each other.  You can really look at each other.  It’s defined almost everyone in this room.  I think faith has been very strong with the people in this room.\nJust steps away from here, in the Hall of Columns, is the statue of John Winthrop, who famously proclaimed that America would stand as “a city upon a hill, a light to all nations with the eyes of all people upon us.”\nToday, almost 400 years after that famous sermon, we see that with the Lord’s help, the city stands taller and shines brighter than ever before — or at least it soon will.\nIn that same hall, we also find the statue of the great Roger Williams, who founded the state of Rhode Island, named its capital city Providence, and built the First Baptist Church in America.\nIt’s Williams that we have to thank for making religious liberty part of the bedrock of American life.  And today we must protect the fundamental freedom with absolute devotion.  We must stand strong, just like generations of Americans have done on the battlefields all around the world.\nFeet away from the magnificent rotunda, another statue watches over visitors to the Capitol.  George Washington, the founder of our country, often called for Americans to join together in prayer — very often.  And more than two centuries later, this morning, we heed President Washington’s wisdom and follow in his mighty footsteps.  He was a strong man and of great religious strength.\nThe stories of legends like Washington, Winthrop, and Williams remind us that without faith in God, there would be no American story.  Every citizen should be proud of this exceptional heritage.  We have an unbelievable heritage, and we have to use that and make life better for everyone.\nThat’s why, as we approach the 25th-times-10 anniversary — think of that, 250; 250 years we’ll be celebrating next year — of our country’s founding, I have signed an executive order to resume the process of creating a new national park full of statues of the greatest Americans who ever lived.\nWe’re going to be honoring our heroes, honoring the greatest people from our country.  We’re not going to be tearing down.  We’re going to be building up.\nIt will be called the National Garden of American Heroes.  Some of you will be on that soon-to-be hallowed ground — some of you.  Let’s see.  I can pick a few of you right now by looking — (laughter) — because there’s a couple of you right now, I can see.  Let’s see.  (Laughter.)  It’s the president’s sole opinion.  (Laughter.)  And I’ve given myself a 25-year period — (laughter) — and then somebody else.  By that time, it will be very, very built up.  (Laughter.)\nNo, it will be something very special, and I hope that Congress will fully fund this wonderfully unifying project at the first possible opportunity — it’s not going to be a lot of money; going to be very important, however — so that more of our people can be inspired by the faith and courage of patriots like those who we honor in these halls.  One of the incredible Americans whose memory my order will celebrate is also recognized with a statue in the Capitol, representing the great state of North Carolina, and that’s a man known — who everybody loved: Reverend Billy Graham.\nHe was something.  My father used to take me to watch the “Crusades.”  He would take me to Yankee Stadium.  I remember it so well.  I remember it more than I remember any Yankee game, and I’ve seen a lot of Yankee games.  (Laughter.)  Can you believe it?  And Billy didn’t have a bat, so, you know, he’s pretty good.  It was amazing.  You’d have 60- or 70,000 people, and they loved him.  They loved him.\nI saw him with Franklin.  I don’t know if Franklin is here.  I just don’t know, but I’ve gotten to know Franklin.  He’s done a great job with helping on tragedies, on problems like in North Carolina, California.  He’s always the first one there.  The work he does is — his father is very proud of him, I can tell you that.  But Billy Graham was very special.\nOne floor below us, Reverend Graham’s statue stands with an open Bible, the page turned to a letter from the apostle Paul, which reads, “Let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season, we will reap if we do not give up.”  Never give up.  Never ever give up.  You can’t.\nHow about me?  If I would have given up, I would not be here right now.  Who the hell knows where I’d be?  (Laughter.)  It might not be a good place.  If it was up to the Democrats, it would not be a good place at all.  (Laughter.)\nNever ever give up.  There could be no better message for the leaders gathered here — and you are real leaders — that we must never give up, and we must never grow tired.  We must never grow weary, and we always must practice good.\nAs you know, last week, only a few miles from here, our nation witnessed a terrible tragedy when 67 people were killed in a horrible accident near Reagan Airport.  As one nation, we take solace in the knowledge that their journey that night did not end in the icy waters of the Potomac, but in the warm embrace of a very loving God.  None of us knows exactly when our time on Earth will be over.  You never know.\nA truth I confronted a few short months ago when there was an incident that wasn’t — it was not fun.  It was not a good thing.  But God was watching me.  The chances of me being here — my sons are shooters.  They’re really good shooters, Don and Eric.  And they said the chances of missing from that range with that gun are — but Don equated it to a one-foot putt.  That’s pretty bad.  Two feet I can see missing.  (Laughter.)  But one foot you can’t miss.  It was the equivalent of a one-foot putt, is what he told me.\nHe said — in fact, he gained some religion.  He gained — he went up 25 percent.  (Laughter.)  And if you know him, that’s a lot.  (Laughter.)  But he said, “There had to be somebody that saved you, and I think I know who it is.”  And he looked up.  And I said, “Whoa, Don, that’s come — you’ve come a long way.”  (Laughter.)  He’s a good guy.\nBut they my two sons just really couldn’t believe it.  Had I not turned that right turn just at that time — and the audience — 55,000 people standing this way.  There were just a few people in the back on the bleachers.  There was nobody over there, except for my all-time favorite chart in history, a chart on immigration.  Immigration saved my life.  See?  So, we’re going to be good for immigration, okay?\nBut had I not made that turn — boom — and quickly.  It was almost as though a deer bolted.  You know, they say the only way you miss when you’re a good shot is if it bolts?  I bolted.  I turned to the right to look at the chart, and I said, “Wow, what was that?  What was that?”\nSo, you never know, but God did that.  I mean, it had to be.  The chances of turning, because there’s no reason to turn to the right.  You know, the chart is rarely brought down.  I brought it down maybe 20 percent and — 20 percent of the time.  And it’s never on my right.  It’s always on my left.  And it’s always at the end of the speech, never the beginning of the speech.\nAnd if I was a little more than that 90-degree angle, it would be no good.  And if I was a little less, it would be no good.  It had to be perfect.  The thing went “shhh” right along the edge.  It didn’t affect my hair.  Can you believe that?    (Laughter.)  It might’ve touched it.  Might have touched it, but not where it counts, not — (laughter) — not the skin part.\nBut it changed something in me, I feel.  I feel even stronger.  I believed in God, but I feel much more strongly about it.  Something happened.  And so — (applause) — thank you.  Thank you.\nBut that event, like the tragedy last week, should remind us all that we have to make the most out of every single day that we have.  Who would think that you’re in space and two things collide?  The odds of that happening are so small, even without proper control.\nWe should have had the proper control.  We should have had better equipment.  We don’t.  We have obsolete equipment.  They were understaffed, for whatever reason.  I guess the helicopter was high, and we’ll find out exactly what happened.  But the odds, even if you had nothing — if you had nobody, the odds of that happening are extremely small.\nIt’s like, did you ever see — you go to a driving range in golf and you’re hitting balls, hundreds of balls, thousands of hours.  I never see a ball hit another ball.  Balls going up all over the place.  You never see them hit.\nIt was amazing that that could happen.  There was a lot of mistakes made, and it should have never happened.  But\nregardless of that, it’s amazing that it happened.\nAnd I think that’s going to be used for good.  I think what is going to happen is we’re all going to sit down and do a great\ncomputerized system for our control towers, brand-new — not pieced together, obsolete, like it is — land-based — trying to hook up a land-based system to a satellite system.\nAnd the first thing that some experts told me when this happened is you can’t hook up land to satellites, and you can’t hook up satellites to land.  It doesn’t work.  And we spent billions and billions of dollars trying to renovate an old, broken system, instead of just saying, “Cut it loose, and let’s spend less money and build a great system.”  Done by two or three companies — very s- — good companies, specialists.  That’s all it is.\nThey used 39 companies.  That means that 39 different hookups have to happen.  And I don’t know how many people of you are good in terms of all of the kind of things necessary for that — and it’s very complex stuff — but when you have 39 different companies working on hooking up different cities and different people — you need one company with one set of equipment.\nAnd there are some countries that have unbelievable air controller systems, and they would have — bells would have gone off when that helicopter literally even hit the same height, because it traveled a long distance before it hit.  It was just like — just wouldn’t stop — you follow the line.  But bells and whistles would have gone off.  They have them where it actually could virtually turn the thing around.  It would have just never happened if we had the right equipment.\nAnd one of the things that’s going to be — I’m going to be speaking to John and to Mike and to Chuck and to everybody.  We have to get together and just — as a single bill, just pass where we get the — the best control system.\nWhen I land in my plane, privately, I use a system from another country, because my captain tells me — I’m landing in New York, and I’m using — I won’t tell you what country, but I use a system from another country, because the captain says, “This thing is so bad.  It’s so obsolete.”  And we can’t have that.\nSo, we’re going to have the best system and it’s a lot of money, but it’s not that much money.  And it’ll happen fast, and it’ll be done by total professionals.  And when it’s done, you’re not going to have accidents.  It’s just not — they’re not — they’re virtually not possible to have.\nEach of us is blessed with a precious chance to help lead America to renew our pledges of faith and everything else and bring us to new heights and create a future of promise for our people and for ourselves.\nYou know, we have the most important people in the country, in a true sense, here, because you’re the ones that are going to make the decision.  You’re the ones that are leading us into so many different things, whether it’s the right air control system or the right size military or what to do and what not to do — most important people.\nAnd many of you are very religious.  I know so many of you are very religious.  And I just think that our country has been so badly hurt.  We’re very hurt by what COVID did to religion.  It really hurt it badly.  People couldn’t go to church for a long period of time.  Even going outside, they were given a hard time.  And I’m not blaming anybody for that, but — but it was very hard to gather.\nSo, they start using computers, if that.  And when they come back, it’s just, you know, a whole new experience they have to get used to.  But it is starting to come back.\nWe had a fantastic thing happen yesterday.  The Army had the best recruitment numbers that they’ve had in more than 15 years.  They think it could be 25 years, actually — they’re going to probably put that out — but more than 15 years just now.  (Applause.)\nAnd we were worried about it.  We were talking about it numerous times that, you know, we don’t have people joining our military services.  We don’t have people joining our police force.  We have to cherish our police.\nIt’s so dangerous.  You open a car and somebody starts shooting.  They have blackened windows.  You don’t even have any idea who’s in the car.  Oftentimes, they have the dark windows — which they’re not, in theory, supposed to have, but they have them.  The door opens and a gun is pointed at your face, and you can’t do a thing about it.  It’s just nothing you’re going to do about it.  Your friends will take them out, and it’s happened so many times, but you just — it’s so — such a dangerous thing.  We have to cherish these people.\nSo, today, we join our hearts and prayers in recommitting to putting our country first.  We have to put our country first, making America stronger and greater and more exceptional than ever before.\nAnd we have to make religion a much more important factor now.  We have to make it an important factor.  And if we do that, it’s going to be — our job is just going to be much easier.  It unifies people.  It brings people together.  Democrats are going to be able to have lunch again and dinner with Republicans.\nAnd I remember, just as — growing up, I’d see — you know, I revered senators and congressmen as something very special, but they were out to dinner all the time.  We had an old congressman, maybe some of — Sey Halpern from Queens,\nand he was a friend of my father.  But he’d have dinner with — he was a Democrat, but he would have dinner with Republicans, and he’d be at it.  It wouldn’t even make a difference.\nToday, it’s like shocking.  And it shouldn’t be.  You have to get together.  We really have to get together.\nWe all know what’s right and what’s wrong, and\nthere’s going to be compromise on both sides, but we have to just do the right thing, and we have to get together.\nYou did it with Marco Rubio.  He got everybody who was — 99 votes.  And the only vote was our VP, who — who maybe we should have been there just to make it a hundred, but I think I would have been angered if it was a hundred.  That might be a step too far, right?  (Laughter.)  But, no, it was great to see a vote.\nPam Bondi had support from Democrats, and some of the others had some pretty good support.  So, you know, it’s doable.\nWe had a recent bill having to do with a very beautiful young lady who was killed from Georgia, and that bill was very bipartisan.  It was a very beautiful thing to watch, actually.  And so, I think we just have to — if possible, we have to unify.\nThere’s big division.  I mean, some people want an open border and some people want a closed border.  We want it closed, and they want it open.  Now, that’s a big difference.  How do you solve that problem?  It’s a big difference.\nSome people want men in women’s sports and some people don’t.  And I was with somebody yesterday who was so upset that the bill was signed, where men cannot participate in women’s sports.  And I said — he’s a very smart guy —\nwent to a great school, was a great student.  And he actually feels, you know, that that should happen: Men should be able to play — meaning transition into women sports.\nAnd you talk to him, and it’s just — you know, I don’t understand it. I think it — I don’t understand how the problem ever got started in the first place.  It just seems so simple.\nBut he’s a good person and just believes it.  He just believes it.  Not going to be easy to convince him otherwise.\nSo, where is a middle ground?  It’s just hard to have a middle ground if there’s two ways.  I mean, you can either do it or you can’t.\nBut I think a lot of good things are going to happen.  You know, a lot of people might be surprised to hear me say that, of all people, but I think a lot of good things are going to happen.  Because our country has got some big headaches, but we have tremendous spirit right now.\nThe spirit is as high as it’s been.  It was up 49 points this morning — 49 points.  That’s the biggest increase in the history of whatever the poll was.\nSo, the spirit is there.  That’s a big factor.  That’s probably the hardest thing to get back, to be honest.  The rest is easy.  The rest is easy.\nSo, I want to just thank you all.  I want to congratulate a lot of the new members.  I see so many of you that ran great races.  David, that was a great race.  But so many that ran great races.  And on both sides, you ran some incredible races.  So, it’s good to be with you.\nAnd God bless everybody.  We want to come together.  And the happiest — the person, the element, the everything that’s going to be happy.  People of religion are going to be happy again.\nAnd I really believe you can’t be happy without religion, without that belief.  I really believe it.  I just don’t see how you can be.  (Applause.)\nSo, let’s bring religion back.  Let’s bring God back into our lives.\nThank you all very much.  Thank you very much.  Great honor.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\n\n\nEND                  8:42 A.M.

Trump signed an Executive Order keeping men out of women’s sports.\n- The Executive Order upholds the promise of Title IX and ends the dangerous and unfair participation of men in women’s sports.The order requires DOJ to abide by the nationwide vacatur of the previous Administration’s illegal Title IX rewrite that would have dissolved single-sex spaces and opportunities.\n\nThe order also requires immediate action, including enforcement actions, against schools and athletic associations comprised of schools that deny women single-sex sports and single-sex locker rooms.\n- The order requires DOJ to abide by the nationwide vacatur of the previous Administration’s illegal Title IX rewrite that would have dissolved single-sex spaces and opportunities.\n- The order also requires immediate action, including enforcement actions, against schools and athletic associations comprised of schools that deny women single-sex sports and single-sex locker rooms.\n- The Executive Order calls for the convening of private sporting bodies in the White House to hear, in person, the stories of female athletes who suffer life-long injuries, who have been silenced and forced to shower with men, and whose hard work has been cast aside due to the biological advantage of males.\n- The Executive Order directs State attorneys general to identify best practices for ensuring equal opportunities for women in sports and to highlight impact stories of women harmed by male athletes competing in women’s sports.\n- The Secretary of State will demand changes within the International Olympic Committee to preserve single-sex sports, a necessity for safety and fairness.\n- The Department of Homeland Security will review visa policies to address males falsely asserting they are females when entering the United States to compete in women’s sports.\nTHE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S WAR ON WOMEN: Instead of standing for the rights of women, Biden caved to woke activists who wanted biological males to be treated as women in workplace showers, competitive sports, prisons, and rape shelters.\n- The Biden Administration ignored the integrity of women’s sports and sex-equality under the 1972 landmark sex-discrimination Title IX law in the name of “inclusivity.”\n- On his first day in office, Biden signed an Executive Order calling on schools across the country to allow students to compete in the sport of their “gender identity.”\n- On the 50th anniversary of Title IX, Biden’s Department of Education “issued a new rule” which redefined the word “women.”\n\nThis move “opened sex-segregated spaces like bathrooms, locker rooms, dorm rooms and single-sex admissions programs to anyone who identifies as a woman” and removed “commonsense” student protections in “campus sexual assault and harassment proceedings.”\n\n\n\nThe Biden Administration argued that states may not pass laws protecting single-sex sports. Their rewrite of Title IX was found to be illegal and has been vacated nationwide.\n- This move “opened sex-segregated spaces like bathrooms, locker rooms, dorm rooms and single-sex admissions programs to anyone who identifies as a woman” and removed “commonsense” student protections in “campus sexual assault and harassment proceedings.”\n- The Biden Administration argued that states may not pass laws protecting single-sex sports. Their rewrite of Title IX was found to be illegal and has been vacated nationwide.\n- The Biden Administration changed federal prison policy to let prisoners be incarcerated with the gender they identify as, including letting biological males be housed with female inmates.\n\nNearly half of trans-identifying male prisoners have sex-offense convictions.\n\n\n\nBecause of Biden’s radical policies, two female inmates at an all-female prison were impregnated by a biological male who claimed to identify as a female.\n- Nearly half of trans-identifying male prisoners have sex-offense convictions.\n- Because of Biden’s radical policies, two female inmates at an all-female prison were impregnated by a biological male who claimed to identify as a female.\n- Biden oversaw a shortage of baby formula and feminine hygiene products, which left women unable to access and afford these essential items.\nWOMEN’S OPPORTUNITIES AND PRIVACY ARE BEING DESTROYED: Policies, like those of the NCAA, are based on the faulty premise that it is possible to medically close the male-female athletic gap. It’s not.\n- Men, on average, have greater muscle mass, strength, and cardiovascular capacity due to testosterone levels, which provides them with physical advantages in many sports.\n\nEven if male athletes “transition” through hormone therapy, they retain physical advantages.\n\n\n\nStories of athletes such as Peyton McNabb, who has been permanently disabled by a male spiking a volleyball in her face during a women’s match, highlight the danger in allowing male participation.\n- Even if male athletes “transition” through hormone therapy, they retain physical advantages.\n- Stories of athletes such as Peyton McNabb, who has been permanently disabled by a male spiking a volleyball in her face during a women’s match, highlight the danger in allowing male participation.\n- Women’s sports were created to give female athletes a level playing field – allowing biological men to compete undermines the fairness and opportunities for women to succeed in their own leagues.\n- Transgender men are pushing out the achievements of women who have worked their whole careers to set records in their respective fields.\n\nFemale athletes have lost nearly 900 medals to men competing against them in women’s sporting categories.\n\n\n\nIn addition to awards and trophies, men have been taking away roster spots, playing time, resources, and opportunities from women.\n- Female athletes have lost nearly 900 medals to men competing against them in women’s sporting categories.\n- In addition to awards and trophies, men have been taking away roster spots, playing time, resources, and opportunities from women.\n- The American people overwhelmingly agree with President Trump – men do not belong in women’s sports.\n\nRoughly seven in 10 Americans oppose men in women’s sports.\n\n\n\nMore than 7,000 NCAA female athletes have personally reached out to the NCAA to change its policies, comply with Title IX, and protect women.\n- Roughly seven in 10 Americans oppose men in women’s sports.\n- More than 7,000 NCAA female athletes have personally reached out to the NCAA to change its policies, comply with Title IX, and protect women.\n- To date, 26 states have enacted policies to protect equal athletic opportunities for women and girls.\nFEMALE ATHLETES ARE SPEAKING OUT:\n- University of Wyoming volleyball player Macey Boggs: “I was stripped of a chance to play my final collegiate matches because we faced a situation no woman should ever have to face, either compete against a team rostering a male athlete on a woman’s scholarship or forfeit the rest of our season. No woman should have to face such a decision. We deserve to compete against athletes whose biology matches our own, not against a male standard.”\n- Roanoke College swim team captain Lily Mullens: “This has been too great a burden to bear for many of our teammates who have lost hours of sleep, many tears, and the will to train to race a swimmer who has an advantage in the water that our bodies may never possess.”\n- Roanoke College swim team member Susanna Price: “The thought of having to compete against a biological man is a message that women aren’t worthy, that we don’t actually matter.”\n- American surfing legend Bethany Hamilton: “California state law allows for males in female surfing events. This is not fair game. I do not support this.”\n- Professional golfer Alison Crenshaw: “This movement was born because there have been numerous incidents where female athletes have had their hard work and potential stolen from them because male athletes were allowed to compete in the female division. It’s wrong, it’s cheating, and female athletes deserve to have their rights as athletes fought for.”\nPRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISES EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS: President Trump has vowed to defend women from gender ideology extremism and restore biological truth to the Federal government.\n- President Trump campaigned on banning men from competing in women’s sports: “You just ban it. You just don’t let it happen.”\n- On Day One, President Trump signed an Executive Order establishing Government-wide the biological reality of two sexes and clearly defining male and female.\n- Earlier this week, President Trump signed Executive Orders to protect children from chemical and surgical mutilation and to prohibit federal funding of the indoctrination of children with radical gender ideology.\n- Today’s Executive Order upholds the original promise of Title IX, keeping his campaign promise to the American people."

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Policy and Purpose.  In recent years, many educational institutions and athletic associations have allowed men to compete in women’s sports.  This is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports.\nMoreover, under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (Title IX), educational institutions receiving Federal funds cannot deny women an equal opportunity to participate in sports.  As some Federal courts have recognized, “ignoring fundamental biological truths between the two sexes deprives women and girls of meaningful access to educational facilities.”  Tennessee v. Cardona, 24-cv-00072 at 73 (E.D. Ky. 2024). See also Kansas v. U.S. Dept. of Education, 24-cv-04041 at 23 (D. Kan. 2024) (highlighting “Congress’ goals of protecting biological women in education”).\nTherefore, it is the policy of the United States to rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities, which results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy.  It shall also be the policy of the United States to oppose male competitive participation in women’s sports more broadly, as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.\nSec. 2.  Definitions.  The definitions in Executive Order 14168 of January 20, 2025 (Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government), shall apply to this order.\nSec.3.  Preserving Women’s Sports in Education.  (a)  In furtherance of the purposes of Title IX, the Secretary of Education shall promptly:\n(i)    in coordination with the Attorney General, continue to comply with the vacatur of the rule entitled “Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance” of April 29, 2024, 89 FR 33474, see Tennessee v. Cardona, 24-cv-00072 at 13-15 (E.D. Ky. 2025), and take other appropriate action to ensure this regulation does not have effect;\n(ii)   take all appropriate action to affirmatively protect all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms and thereby provide the equal opportunity guaranteed by Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, including enforcement actions described in subsection (iii); to bring regulations and policy guidance into line with the Congress’ existing demand for “equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes” by clearly specifying and clarifying that women’s sports are reserved for women; and the resolution of pending litigation consistent with this policy; and\n(iii)  prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against educational institutions (including athletic associations composed of or governed by such institutions) that deny female students an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them, in the women’s category, to compete with or against or to appear unclothed before males.\n(b)  All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall review grants to educational programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding to programs that fail to comply with the policy established in this order.\n(c)  The Department of Justice shall provide all necessary resources, in accordance with law, to relevant agencies to ensure expeditious enforcement of the policy established in this order.\nSec. 4.  Preserving Fairness and Safety in Women’s Sports.  Many sport-specific governing bodies have no official position or requirements regarding trans-identifying athletes.  Others allow men to compete in women’s categories if these men reduce the testosterone in their bodies below certain levels or provide documentation of “sincerely held” gender identity.  These policies are unfair to female athletes and do not protect female safety.  To address these concerns, it is hereby ordered:\n(a)  The Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall, within 60 days of the date of this order:\n(i)   convene representatives of major athletic organizations and governing bodies, and female athletes harmed by such policies, to promote policies that are fair and safe, in the best interests of female athletes, and consistent with the requirements of Title IX, as applicable; and\n(ii)  convene State Attorneys General to identify best practices in defining and enforcing equal opportunities for women to participate in sports and educate them about stories of women and girls who have been harmed by male participation in women’s sports.\n(b)  The Secretary of State, including through the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs’ Sports Diplomacy Division and the Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations, shall:\n(i)   rescind support for and participation in people-to-people sports exchanges or other sports programs within which the relevant female sports category is based on identity and not sex; and\n(ii)  promote, including at the United Nations, international rules and norms governing sports competition to protect a sex-based female sports category, and, at the discretion of the Secretary of State, convene international athletic organizations and governing bodies, and female athletes harmed by policies that allow male participation in women’s sports, to promote sporting policies that are fair, safe, and in furtherance of the best interests of female athletes.\n(c)  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall review and adjust, as needed, policies permitting admission to the United States of males seeking to participate in women’s sports, and shall issue guidance with an objective of preventing such entry to the extent permitted by law, including pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)).\n(d)  The Secretary of State shall use all appropriate and available measures to see that the International Olympic Committee amends the standards governing Olympic sporting events to promote fairness, safety, and the best interests of female athletes by ensuring that eligibility for participation in women’s sporting events is determined according to sex and not gender identity or testosterone reduction.\nSec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(d)  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nFebruary 5, 2025.\n\n"

the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).\nUNRWA has reportedly been infiltrated by members of groups long designated by the Secretary of State (Secretary) as foreign terrorist organizations, and UNRWA employees were involved in the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.  UNHRC has protected human rights abusers by allowing them to use the organization to shield themselves from scrutiny, while UNESCO has demonstrated failure to reform itself, has continually demonstrated anti-Israel sentiment over the past decade, and has failed to address concerns over mounting arrears.\nSec. 2.  UNHRC and UNESCO Participation.  (a)  The United States will not participate in the UNHRC and will not seek election to that body.  The Secretary shall terminate the office of United States Representative to the UNHRC and any positions primarily dedicated to supporting the United States Representative to the UNHRC.\n(b)  The United States will also conduct a review of its membership in UNESCO.  This review shall be led by the Secretary, in coordination with the United States Representative to the United Nations (UN Ambassador), and must be completed within 90 days of the date of this order.  The review will include an evaluation of how and if UNESCO supports United States interests.  In particular, the review will include an analysis of any anti-Semitism or anti-Israel sentiment within the organization.\nSec. 3.  Funding.  (a)  Executive departments and agencies shall not use any funds for a contribution, grant, or other payment to UNRWA, consistent with section 301 of title III, division G, of Public Law 118-47 (March 23, 2024).  The Secretary shall withdraw the determination previously made under section 7048(c)(1) of title VII, division F, of Public Law 118-47.  Accordingly, of the funds appropriated for a contribution to the UN Regular Budget under the heading “Contributions to International Organizations” of Public Law 118-47, as most recently continued by Public Law 118-158 (December 21, 2024), the Secretary shall withhold the United States proportionate share of the total annual amount of UN Regular Budget funding for the UNHRC, consistent with section 7048(c) of title VII, division F, of Public Law 118-47.\n(b)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary, in consultation with the UN Ambassador, shall conduct a review of all international intergovernmental organizations of which the United States is a member and provides any type of funding or other support, and all conventions and treaties to which the United States is a party, to determine which organizations, conventions, and treaties are contrary to the interests of the United States and whether such organizations, conventions, or treaties can be reformed.  Upon the conclusion of that review, the Secretary shall report the findings to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and provide recommendations as to whether the United States should withdraw from any such organizations, conventions, or treaties.\nSec. 4.  Notification.  The Secretary shall inform the UN Secretary General and the leadership of UNRWA and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights that the United States will not fund UNRWA or the UNHRC and that the United States will not satisfy any claims to pay 2025 assessments or prior arrears by these organizations.\nSec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof;

that Iran’s network and campaign of regional aggression be neutralized; that the IRGC and its surrogates be disrupted, degraded, or denied access to the resources that sustain their destabilizing activities; and to counter Iran’s aggressive development of missiles and other asymmetric and conventional weapons capabilities.      Sec. 2.  Enacting Maximum Pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran.  (a)  The Secretary of the Treasury shall:              (i)    immediately impose sanctions or appropriate enforcement remedies on all persons for which the Department has evidence of activity in violation of one or more Iran-related sanctions;              (ii)   implement a robust and continual sanctions enforcement campaign with respect to Iran that denies the regime and its terror proxies access to revenue;              (iii)  review for modification or rescission any general license, frequently asked question, or other guidance that provides Iran or any of its terror proxies any degree of economic or financial relief;\n(iv)   issue updated guidance to all relevant business sectors including shipping, insurance, and port operators, about the risks to any person that knowingly violates United States sanctions with respect to Iran or an Iranian terror proxy; and              (v)    maintain countermeasures against Iran at the Financial Action Task Force, evaluate beneficial ownership thresholds to ensure sanctions deny Iran all possible illicit revenue, and evaluate whether financial institutions should adopt a “Know Your Customer’s Customer” standard for Iran-related transactions to further prevent sanctions evasion.\n(b)  The Secretary of State shall:              (i)    modify or rescind sanctions waivers, particularly those that provide Iran any degree of economic or financial relief, including those related to Iran’s Chabahar port project;              (ii)   implement a robust and continual campaign, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury and other relevant executive departments or agencies (agencies), to drive Iran’s export of oil to zero, including exports of Iranian crude to the People’s Republic of China;              (iii)  lead a diplomatic campaign to isolate Iran throughout the world, including within international organizations, including the denial of freedom of movement or safe haven to the IRGC or any terror proxy of Iran wherever such may operate outside Iran’s borders; and              (iv)   take immediate steps, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury and other relevant agencies, to ensure that the Iraqi financial system is not utilized by Iran for sanctions evasion or circumvention, and that Gulf countries are not used as sanctions evasion transshipment points. (c)  The United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations shall:              (i)    work with key allies to complete the snapback of international sanctions and restrictions on Iran;              (ii)   hold Iran accountable for its breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; and              (iii)  regularly convene the United Nations Security Council to highlight the myriad threats posed by Iran to international peace and security. (d)  The Secretary of Commerce shall conduct a robust and continuous export control enforcement campaign to restrict the flow of technology and components used by the regime for military purposes.\n(e)  The Attorney General shall:              (i)    pursue all available legal steps to investigate, disrupt, and prosecute financial and logistical networks, operatives, or front groups inside the United States that are sponsored by Iran or an Iranian terror proxy;              (ii)   pursue all available legal steps to impound illicit Iranian oil cargoes;              (iii)  pursue all available legal steps to identify Iranian governmental assets in the United States and overseas, and help American victims of terrorism, including Gold Star Families, collect on Federal judgments against Iran;              (iv)   pursue all available legal steps to indict and prosecute the leaders and members of Iranian-funded terrorist groups and proxies that have captured, harmed, or killed American citizens and, where possible and in coordination with the Secretary of State, seek their arrest and extradition to the United States; and                 (v)    use all criminal, regulatory, and cyber authorities and tools to vigorously investigate, prosecute, and disrupt efforts by the Iranian government to conduct espionage or obtain military, intelligence, government, or other sensitive information, compromise the Homeland and our critical infrastructure, evade sanctions and export controls, obtain material support for terrorism, exert foreign malign influence, and threaten harm and infringe on First Amendment-protected speech, including efforts designed to sow anti-Semitism.      Sec. 3.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:              (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or              (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.        (b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.        (c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person."

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Background. On February 1, 2025, I determined that the failure of Canada to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept drug trafficking organizations, other drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  To address that threat, I invoked my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA to impose ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of Canada.\nSec. 2.  Immediate Steps.  Pursuant to section 3 of my Executive Order of February 1, 2025, titled “Imposing Duties to Address the Situation at Our Northern Border” (“the Executive Order of February 1, 2025”), I have determined that the Government of Canada has taken immediate steps designed to alleviate the illegal migration and illicit drug crisis through cooperative actions.  Further time is needed, however, to assess whether these steps constitute sufficient action to alleviate the crisis and resolve the unusual and extraordinary threat beyond our northern border.\nSec. 3.  Pause.  (a)  In recognition of the steps taken by the Government of Canada, and in order to assess whether the threat described in section 1 of this order has abated, the additional 25 percent ad valorem rates of duty, and 10 percent ad valorem rates of duty as to energy products, shall be paused and will not take effect until March 4, 2025, at 12:01 a.m. eastern time.  Accordingly, section 2(a), section 2(b), section 2(e), and section 2(f) of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025, are amended by striking the term “February 4, 2025,” where it appears in those sections and inserting in lieu thereof the term “March 4, 2025.”  The exceptions set forth in section 2(a) and section 2(b) of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025, related to covered goods loaded onto a vessel at a port of entry or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States are, hereby, withdrawn.(b)  During this pause, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security shall continue to assess the situation at our northern border, as provided in section 3 of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025.(c)  If the illegal migration and illicit drug crises worsen, and if the Government of Canada fails to take sufficient steps to alleviate these crises, the President shall take necessary steps to address the situation, including by immediate implementation of the tariffs described in the Executive Order of February 1, 2025.\nSec. 4.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nSec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.THE WHITE HOUSE,    February 3, 2025."

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Background.  On February 1, 2025, I determined that the failure of Mexico to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept Mexican drug trafficking organizations, other drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  To address that threat, I invoked my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA to impose ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of Mexico.     Sec. 2.  Immediate Steps.  Pursuant to section 3 of my Executive Order of February 1, 2025, titled “Imposing Duties to Address the Situation at Our Southern Border” (“the Executive Order of February 1, 2025”), I have determined that the Government of Mexico has taken immediate steps designed to alleviate the illegal migration and illicit drug crisis through cooperative actions.  Further time is needed, however, to assess whether these steps constitute sufficient action to alleviate the crisis and resolve the unusual and extraordinary threat beyond our southern border.     Sec. 3.  Pause.  (a)  In recognition of the steps taken by the Government of Mexico, and in order to assess whether the threat described in section 1 of this order has abated, the additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty shall be paused and will not take effect until March 4, 2025, at 12:01 am eastern time. Accordingly, sections 2(a), sections 2(d), and section 2(e) of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025, are amended by striking the term “February 4, 2025,” where it appears in those sections and inserting in lieu thereof the term “March, 4, 2025.”  The exceptions set forth in section 2(a) of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025, related to covered goods loaded onto a vessel at a port of entry or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States are, hereby, withdrawn.     (b)  During this pause, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, shall continue to assess the situation at our southern border, as provided in section 3 of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025.     (c)  If the illegal migration and illicit drug crises worsen, and if the Government of Mexico fails to take sufficient steps to alleviate these crises, the President shall take necessary steps to address the situation, including by immediate implementation of the tariffs described in the Executive Order of February 1, 2025.      Sec. 4.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.     Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:     (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or     (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.            THE WHITE HOUSE,    February 3, 2025."

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,\nI, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the sustained influx of illicit opioids and other drugs has profound consequences on our Nation, endangering lives and putting a severe strain on our healthcare system, public services, and communities.\nThis challenge threatens the fabric of our society.  Gang members, smugglers, human traffickers, and illicit drugs of all kinds have poured across our borders and into our communities.  Canada has played a central role in these challenges, including by failing to devote sufficient attention and resources or meaningfully coordinate with United States law enforcement partners to effectively stem the tide of illicit drugs.\nDrug trafficking organizations (DTOs) are the world’s leading producers of fentanyl, methamphetamine, cocaine, and other illicit drugs, and they cultivate, process, and distribute massive quantities of narcotics that fuel addiction and violence in communities across the United States.  These DTOs often collaborate with transnational cartels to smuggle illicit drugs into the United States, utilizing clandestine airstrips, maritime routes, and overland corridors.\nThe challenges at our southern border are foremost in the public consciousness, but our northern border is not exempt from these issues.  Criminal networks are implicated in human trafficking and smuggling operations, enabling unvetted illegal migration across our northern border.  There is also a growing presence of Mexican cartels operating fentanyl and nitazene synthesis labs in Canada.  The flow of illicit drugs like fentanyl to the United States through both illicit distribution networks and international mail — due, in the case of the latter, to the existing administrative exemption from duty and taxes, also known as de minimis, under section 1321 of title 19, United States Code — has created a public health crisis in the United States, as outlined in the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy) and Executive Order 14157 of January 20, 2025 (Designating Cartels and Other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists).  With respect to smuggling of illicit drugs across our northern border, Canada’s Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre recently published a study on the laundering of proceeds of illicit synthetic opioids, which recognized Canada’s heightened domestic production of fentanyl, largely from British Columbia, and its growing footprint within international narcotics distribution.  Despite a North American dialogue on the public health impacts of illicit drugs since 2016, Canadian officials have acknowledged that the problem has only grown.  And while U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the Department of Homeland Security seized, comparatively, much less fentanyl from Canada than from Mexico last year, fentanyl is so potent that even a very small parcel of the drug can cause many deaths and destruction to America families.  In fact, the amount of fentanyl that crossed the northern border last year could kill 9.5 million Americans.\nImmediate action is required to finally end this public health crisis and national emergency, which will not happen unless the compliance and cooperation of Canada is assured.\nI hereby determine and order:\nSection 1.  (a)  As President of the United States, my highest duty is the defense of the country and its citizens.  A Nation without borders is not a nation at all.  I will not stand by and allow our sovereignty to be eroded, our laws to be trampled, our citizens to be endangered, or our borders to be disrespected anymore.\nI previously declared a national emergency with respect to the grave threat to the United States posed by the influx of illegal aliens and illicit drugs into the United States in Proclamation 10886 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border).  Pursuant to the NEA, I hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in that Proclamation to cover the threat to the safety and security of Americans, including the public health crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept DTOs, other drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs.  In addition, this failure to act on the part of Canada constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.  I hereby declare and reiterate a national emergency under the NEA and IEEPA to deal with that threat.  This national emergency requires decisive and immediate action, and I have decided to impose, consistent with law, ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of Canada set forth in this order.  In doing so, I invoke my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA and specifically find that action under other authority to impose tariffs is inadequate to address this unusual and extraordinary threat.\nSec. 2.  (a)  All articles that are products of Canada as defined by the Federal Register notice described in subsection (e) of this section (Federal Register notice), and except for those products described in subsection (b) of this section, shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty.  Such rate of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except that goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, after such time that were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States before 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 1, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty, only if the importer certifies to CBP as specified in the Federal Register notice.\n(b)  With respect to energy or energy resources, as defined in section 8 of Executive Order 14156 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Energy Emergency), and as otherwise included in the Federal Register notice, such articles that are products of Canada as defined by the Federal Register notice shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty.  Such rate of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except that goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, after such time that were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States before 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 1, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty, only if the importer certifies to CBP as specified in the Federal Register notice.\n(c)  The rates of duty established by this order are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, or charges applicable to such imported articles.\n(d)  Should Canada retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on United States exports to Canada or similar measures, the President may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.\n(e)  In order to establish the duty rate on imports of articles that are products of Canada, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine the modifications necessary to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) in order to effectuate this order consistent with law and shall make such modifications to the HTSUS through notice in the Federal Register.  The modifications made to the HTSUS by this notice shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, and shall continue in effect until such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.\n(f)  Articles that are products of Canada, except those that are eligible for admission under “domestic status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, which are subject to the duties imposed by this order and are admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except as otherwise noted in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, must be admitted as “privileged foreign status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.41.  Such articles will be subject upon entry for consumption to the rates of duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading in effect at the time of admittance into the United States foreign trade zone.\n(g)  No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed pursuant to this order.\n(h)  For avoidance of doubt, duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321 shall not be available for the articles described in subsection (a) and subsection (b) of this section.\n(i)  Any prior Presidential Proclamation, Executive Order, or other Presidential directive or guidance related to trade with Canada that is inconsistent with the direction in this order is hereby terminated, suspended, or modified to the extent necessary to give full effect to this order.\n(j)  The articles described in subsection (a) and subsection (b) of this section shall exclude those encompassed by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b).\nSec. 3.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall regularly consult with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security on the situation at our northern border.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall inform the President of any circumstances that, in the opinion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, indicate that the Government of Canada has taken adequate steps to alleviate this public health crisis through cooperative enforcement actions.  Upon the President’s determination of sufficient action to alleviate the crisis, the tariffs described in section 2 of this order shall be removed.\n(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, shall recommend additional action, if necessary, should the Government of Canada fail to take adequate steps to alleviate the illegal migration and illicit drug crises through cooperative enforcement actions.\nSec. 4.  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order.  The Secretary of Homeland Security may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of Homeland Security.  All executive departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.\nSec. 5.  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Commerce, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency under IEEPA declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).\nSec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n\nFebruary 1, 2025."

However, in 2023 the U.S. trade deficit in goods was the world’s largest at over $1 trillion.\n- Tariffs are a powerful, proven source of leverage for protecting the national interest.  President Trump is using the tools at hand and taking decisive action that puts Americans’ safety and our national security first.\n- Though previous Administrations have failed to leverage America’s combination of exceptional strength and its unique role in world trade to advance the security interests of the American people, President Trump has not.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP IS KEEPING HIS PROMISE TO STOP THE FLOOD OF ILLEGAL ALIENS AND DRUGS: When voters overwhelmingly elected Donald J.

That is exactly what he is doing.\n- The Biden Administration’s policies have fueled the worst border crisis in U.S. history.\n- More than 10 million illegal aliens attempted to enter the United States under Biden’s leadership, including a rising number of Chinese nationals and people on the terror watchlist.\n- This problem is not confined to the southern border – encounters at the northern border with Canada are rising as well.\n- The sustained influx of illegal aliens has profound consequences on every aspect of our national life – overwhelming our schools, lowering our wages, reducing our housing supply and raising rents, overcrowding our hospitals, draining our welfare system, and causing crime.\n- Gang members, smugglers, human traffickers, and illegal drugs and narcotics of all kinds are pouring across our borders and into our communities.\n\nLast fiscal year, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) apprehended more than 21,000 pounds of fentanyl at our borders, enough fentanyl to kill more than 4 billion people.\n\n\n\nIt is estimated that federal officials are only able to seize a fraction of the fentanyl smuggled across the southern border.\n- Last fiscal year, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) apprehended more than 21,000 pounds of fentanyl at our borders, enough fentanyl to kill more than 4 billion people.\n- It is estimated that federal officials are only able to seize a fraction of the fentanyl smuggled across the southern border.\n- These drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone.\n\nMore Americans are dying from fentanyl overdoses each year than the number of American lives lost in the entirety of the Vietnam War.\n- More Americans are dying from fentanyl overdoses each year than the number of American lives lost in the entirety of the Vietnam War.\nBUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS: President Trump continues to demonstrate his commitment to ensuring U.S. trade policy serves the national interest.\n- As President Trump said in the Presidential Memorandum on American First Trade Policy, trade policy is a critical component in national security.\n- President Trump promised in November to “sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders. This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!”\n- During his first term as President of the United States, President Trump established the President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and declared the Opioid Crisis a public health emergency.\n- President Trump also has a long record of putting America first on trade. In his first term, President Trump successfully used threats of tariffs on Mexico to help secure our border.\n- When our national security was threatened by a global oversupply of steel and aluminum, President Trump took swift action to protect America’s national security by implementing tariffs on imports of these goods.\n- In response to China’s intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, and other unreasonable behavior, President Trump acted with conviction to impose tariffs on imports from China, using that leverage to reach a historic bilateral economic agreement.\n- Just last week, President Trump leveraged tariffs to successfully resolve national security concerns with Colombia, swiftly reaching an outcome that prioritizes the safety and security of the American people and the sanctity of our national borders."

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,\nI, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the sustained influx of synthetic opioids has profound consequences on our Nation, including by killing approximately two hundred Americans per day, putting a severe strain on our healthcare system, ravaging our communities, and destroying our families.  Synthetic opioid overdose is the leading cause of death for people aged 18 to 45 in the United States.      During my first term, I took steps to end the direct flow of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to the United States.  Since then, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which exerts ultimate control over the government and enterprises of the PRC, has subsidized and otherwise incentivized PRC chemical companies to export fentanyl and related precursor chemicals that are used to produce synthetic opioids sold illicitly in the United States.      Furthermore, the PRC provides support to and safe haven for PRC-origin transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) that launder the revenues from the production, shipment, and sale of illicit synthetic opioids.  These PRC-origin TCOs coordinate and communicate using PRC social media software applications in the conduct of their business.     Many PRC-based chemical companies also go to great lengths to evade law enforcement and hide illicit substances in the flow of legitimate commerce.  Some of the techniques employed by these PRC-based companies to conceal the true contents of the parcels and the identity of the distributors include the use of re-shippers in the United States, false invoices, fraudulent postage, and deceptive packaging.   While more than 500,000 pounds of drugs have been seized at the southern border each of the last 3 fiscal years, in addition, more than 42,000 pounds of drugs have been seized at the northern border each year on average over the last 3 years.  Illicit drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone.     The influx of these drugs to our Nation threatens the fabric of our society.  The PRC plays a central role in this challenge, not merely by failing to stem the ultimate source of many illicit drugs distributed in the United States, but by actively sustaining and expanding the business of poisoning our citizens.     The flow of contraband drugs like fentanyl to the United States through illicit distribution networks has created a national emergency, including a public health crisis in the United States, as outlined in the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy), Proclamation 10886 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border of the United States), and Executive Order 14157 of January 20, 2025 (Designating Cartels and Other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists).      Despite multiple attempts to resolve this crisis at its root source through bilateral dialogue, PRC officials have failed to follow through with the decisive actions needed to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal cartels and shut down the money laundering TCOs.  The PRC implements the most sophisticated domestic surveillance network coupled with the most comprehensive domestic law enforcement apparatus in the world.  The PRC also routinely exerts extraterritorial reach across the globe to threaten, harass, and suppress what it views as political dissent.  As such, the CCP does not lack the capacity to severely blunt the global illicit opioid epidemic; it simply is unwilling to do so.     Immediate action is required to address the national emergency I declared and to finally end this emergency, including the public health crisis caused by opioid use and addiction, which will not happen until the full compliance and cooperation of the PRC government is assured.I hereby determine and order:     Section 1.  (a)  As President of the United States, my highest duty is the defense of the country and its citizens.  I will not stand by and allow our citizens to be poisoned, our laws to be trampled, our communities to be ravaged, or our families to be destroyed.     I previously declared a national emergency with respect to the grave threat to the United States posed by the influx of illegal aliens and drugs into the United States in Proclamation 10886.  Pursuant to the NEA, I hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in that proclamation to cover the failure of the PRC government to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept chemical precursor suppliers, money launderers, other TCOs, criminals at large, and drugs.  In addition, this failure to act constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  I hereby declare and reiterate a national emergency under the NEA and IEEPA to deal with that threat.  This national emergency requires decisive and immediate action, and I have decided to impose, consistent with law, ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of the PRC as set forth in this order.  In doing so, I invoke my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA, and specifically find that action under other authority to impose tariffs is inadequate to address this unusual and extraordinary threat.     Sec. 2.  (a)  All articles that are products of the PRC, as defined by the Federal Register notice described in section 2(d) of this order (the Federal Register notice), shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty.  Such rate of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except that goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, after such time that were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States before 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 1, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty, only if the importer certifies to U.S. Customs and Border Protection within the Department of Homeland Security as specified in the Federal Register notice.      (b)  The rates of duty established by this order are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, or charges applicable to such imported articles.      (c)  Should the PRC retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on United States exports to the PRC or similar measures, the President may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this Executive Order to ensure the efficacy of this action.     (d)  In order to establish the duty rate on imports of articles that are products of the PRC, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine the modifications necessary to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) in order to effectuate the objectives of this order consistent with law and shall make such modifications to the HTSUS through notice in the Federal Register.  The modifications made to the HTSUS by this notice shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except as otherwise noted in subsection 2(a) of this section, and shall continue in effect until such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.     (e)  Articles that are products of the PRC, except those that are eligible for admission under “domestic status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, which are subject to the duties imposed by this order and are admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except as otherwise noted in subsection 2(a) of this section, must be admitted as “privileged foreign status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.41.  Such articles will be subject upon entry for consumption to the rates of duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading in effect at the time of admittance into the United States foreign trade zone.      (f)  No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed pursuant to this order.      (g)  For avoidance of doubt, duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321 shall not be available for the articles described in subsection (a) of this section.      (h)  Any prior Presidential Proclamation, Executive Order, or other presidential directive or guidance related to trade with the PRC that is inconsistent with the direction in this order is hereby terminated, suspended, or modified to the extent necessary to give full effect to this order.      (i)  The articles described in subsection (a) of this section shall exclude those encompassed by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b).     Sec. 3.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall regularly consult with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Attorney General, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security on the situation regarding the PRC.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall inform the President of any circumstances that, in the opinion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, indicate that the PRC government has taken adequate steps to alleviate the opioid crisis through cooperative actions.  Upon the President’s determination of sufficient action to alleviate the crisis, the tariffs described in section 2 of this order will be removed.     (b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, shall recommend additional action, if necessary, should the PRC fail to take adequate steps to alleviate the illicit drug crisis through cooperative enforcement actions.     Sec. 4.  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order.  The Secretary of Homeland Security may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of Homeland Security.  All executive departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.     Sec. 5.  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Attorney General, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency under IEEPA declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).     Sec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:     (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or     (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.     (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.                        THE WHITE HOUSE,    February 1, 2025."

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the sustained influx of illegal aliens and illicit opioids and other drugs has profound consequences on our Nation, endangering lives and putting a severe strain on our healthcare system, public services, communities, and schools.  Since the end of my first term, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the Department of Homeland Security has recorded more than three times as many inadmissible encounters nationwide as during my first term.     These challenges threaten the fabric of our society.  Gang members, smugglers, human traffickers, and illicit drugs of all kinds have poured across our borders and into our communities.  Mexico has played a central role in these challenges, including by failing to devote sufficient attention and resources to meaningfully stem the tide of unlawful migration and illicit drugs.     Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) are the world’s leading traffickers of fentanyl, methamphetamine, cocaine, and other illicit drugs, and they cultivate, process, and distribute massive quantities of narcotics that fuel addiction and violence in communities across the United States.  These DTOs collaborate and conspire with transnational cartels and other global partners to smuggle drugs into the United States, utilizing clandestine airstrips, maritime routes, tunnels, and overland corridors, and both willing and unwilling human couriers.\nThe Mexican DTOs have an intolerable alliance with the government of Mexico. This alliance endangers the national security of the United States, and we must eradicate the influence of these dangerous cartels from the bilateral environment. The government of Mexico has afforded safe havens for the cartels to engage in the manufacturing and transportation of illicit drugs, which collectively have led to the overdose deaths of hundreds of thousands of American victims.\nMexican cartels are also implicated in human trafficking and smuggling operations, enabling the illegal migration of millions across our borders.  These operations are often tied to organized crime, and they create pathways for cartel activities to expand into the United States.  Furthermore, violent criminals originating from Central and South America easily transit into and through Mexico, and into the United States, where they cause irreparable harm to our citizens.  These dangerous criminals are involved in drug-related violence, gang activity, and other crimes that endanger the safety of American communities.      Immediate action is required to address the national emergency I declared in Proclamation 10886 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border of the United States), and to finally end the public health crisis caused by opioid use and addiction, which will not happen unless the compliance and

    "content": "MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES\nSUBJECT:       Limiting Lame-Duck Collective Bargaining Agreements That Improperly Attempt to Constrain the New President\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 7301 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:Section 1.  Policy and Purpose.  In the final days of the prior administration’s tenure, it purposefully finalized collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) with Federal employees in an effort to harm my Administration by extending its wasteful and failing policies beyond its time in office.  For example, the Department of Education negotiated a CBA on January 17, 2025 — 3 days before I took office — that generally prohibits the agency from returning remote employees to their offices.Such last-minute, lame-duck CBAs, which purport to bind a new President to his predecessor’s policies, run counter to America’s system of democratic self-government.  CBAs quickly negotiated to include extreme policies on the eve of a new administration are purposefully designed to circumvent the will of the people and our democracy.  Such CBAs inhibit the President’s authority to manage the executive branch by tying his hands with inefficient and ineffective practices.  The Supreme Court has explained that a President “cannot choose to bind his successors by diminishing their powers.”Therefore, it is the policy of the executive branch that CBAs executed in the 30 days prior to the inauguration of a new President, and that purport to remain in effect despite the inauguration of a new President and administration, shall not be approved.Sec. 2.  Standards for CBA Duration.  (a)  No executive department or agency (agency) or agency employees shall make a CBA governing conditions of employment in the 30 days prior to a change in Presidential administrations that:(i)    creates new contractual obligations;(ii)   makes substantive changes to existing agreements; or(iii)  extends the duration of an existing agreement.(b)  Subsection (a) of this section applies only to the extent that its requirements do not prevent CBAs from rolling over under existing contractual provisions.(c)  To the extent that subordinate agency personnel have executed a CBA that violates the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, but the applicable agency head has not yet approved such agreement pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7114(c), such agency head shall promptly disapprove such agreement as inconsistent with the requirements of this memorandum. (d)  The requirements of this section do not apply to CBAs that primarily cover law enforcement officers, as that term is used in 18 U.S.C. 1515(a)(4).Sec. 3.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c)  If the Federal Labor Relations Authority or a court of competent jurisdiction issues a final judgment holding that section 2(d) of this memorandum would prevent this memorandum from being considered a Government-wide rule or regulation for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 7117(a)(1), section 2(d) of this memorandum shall be severed and rendered inoperative thereby and given no force or effect.(d)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.(e)  The Director of the Office of Personnel Management is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register."

    "content": "ELIMINATING 10 REGULATIONS FOR EACH NEW REGULATION ISSUED: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to unleash prosperity through deregulation.\n- The Order requires that whenever an agency promulgates a new rule, regulation, or guidance, it must identify at least 10 existing rules, regulations, or guidance documents to be repealed.\n- The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will ensure standardized measurement and estimation of regulatory costs.\n- It requires that for fiscal year 2025, the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, be significantly less than zero.\nHALTING THE REGULATORY ONSLAUGHT: President Trump will halt the job killing and inflation-driving regulatory blitz of the Biden Administration.\n- The Biden Administration imposed a historic $1.7 trillion in costs on the American people.\n- Overregulation stops American entrepreneurship, crushes small business, reduces consumer choice, discourages innovation, and infringes on the liberties of American citizens.\n\nIt also contributes to the high cost of living, including by driving up energy prices.\n- It also contributes to the high cost of living, including by driving up energy prices.\nBUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS:  President Trump’s first Administration undertook the most aggressive and successful regulatory reduction effort in history.\n- In his first term, President Trump asked the agencies to eliminate two regulations for each one new regulation issued.  Not only was this 2-for-1 goal achieved, the first Trump Administration eliminated five and a half regulations for everyone new regulation issued.\n- This Executive Order builds on President Trump’s previous success to improve daily lives of the American people by reducing unnecessary, burdensome, and costly Federal regulations."

    "content": "UNLEASHING PROSPERITY THROUGH DEREGULATION\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, as amended (31 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), and in order to promote prudent financial management and alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  The ever-expanding morass of complicated Federal regulation imposes massive costs on the lives of millions of Americans, creates a substantial restraint on our economic growth and ability to build and innovate, and hampers our global competitiveness.  Despite the magnitude of their impact, these measures are often difficult for the average person or business to understand, as they require synthesizing the collective meaning not just of formal regulations but also rules, memoranda, administrative orders, guidance documents, policy statements, and interagency agreements that are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, further increasing compliance costs and the risk of costs of non-compliance.  It is the policy of my Administration to significantly reduce the private expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations to secure America’s economic prosperity and national security and the highest possible quality of life for each citizen.  To that end, it is important that for each new regulation issued, at least 10 prior regulations be identified for elimination.  This practice is to ensure that the cost of planned regulations is responsibly managed and controlled through a rigorous regulatory budgeting process.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the executive branch to be prudent and financially responsible in the expenditure of funds, from both public and private sources, and to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people.\nSec. 3.  Regulatory Cap for Fiscal Year 2025.  (a)  Unless prohibited by law, whenever an executive department or agency (agency) publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation, it shall identify at least 10 existing regulations to be repealed.\n(b)  For fiscal year 2025, which is in progress, the heads of all agencies are directed to ensure that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, being finalized this year, shall be significantly less than zero, as determined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director), unless otherwise required by law or instructions from the Director.\n(c)  In furtherance of the requirement of subsection (a) of this section, any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least 10 prior regulations.\n(d)  The Director shall provide the heads of agencies with guidance on the implementation of this section.  Such guidance shall address, among other things, processes for standardizing the measurement and estimation of regulatory costs; standards for determining what qualifies as new and offsetting regulations; standards for determining the costs of existing regulations that are considered for elimination; processes for accounting for costs in different fiscal years; methods to oversee the issuance of rules with costs offset by savings at different times or different agencies; and emergencies and other circumstances that might justify individual waivers of the requirements of this section.  The Director shall consider phasing in and updating these requirements.\nSec. 4.  Annual Regulatory Cost Submissions to the Office of Management and Budget.  Beginning with the Regulatory Plans, as required under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended, or any successor order for fiscal year 2026, and for each fiscal year thereafter:\n(a)  The head of each agency shall identify on an aggregated basis, for regulations that increase incremental cost, the offsetting regulations described in section 3(c) of this order, and provide the agency’s best approximation of the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation.\n(b)  Each regulation approved by the Director during the Presidential budget process shall be included in the Unified Regulatory Agenda required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order.  Unless otherwise required by law, no regulation shall be added to or removed from the Unified Regulatory Agenda without the approval of the Director.  To accomplish the purposes of this order, the Director may also require additions to the Unified Regulatory Agenda and Regulatory Plan.\n(c)  Unless otherwise required by law, no regulation shall be issued by an agency if it was not included in the most recent version or update of the published Unified Regulatory Agenda as required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order, unless the issuance of such regulation was approved in advance in writing by the Director.\n(d)  During the Presidential budget process, the Director shall identify to agencies a total amount of incremental costs that will be allowed for each agency in issuing new regulations and repealing regulations for each fiscal year after fiscal year 2025.  No regulations exceeding the agency’s total incremental cost allowance will be permitted in that fiscal year, unless required by law or approved in writing by the Director.  The total incremental cost allowance may allow an increase or require a reduction in total regulatory cost.\n(e)  The Director shall provide the heads of agencies with guidance on the implementation of the requirements in this section.\nSec. 5.  Definition.  For purposes of this order, the term “regulation” or “rule” means an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or to describe the procedure or practice requirements of an agency, including, without limitation, regulations, rules, memoranda, administrative orders, guidance documents, policy statements, and interagency agreements, regardless of whether the same were enacted through the processes in the Administrative Procedure Act, but does not include:\n(a)  regulations issued with respect to a military, national security, homeland security, foreign affairs, or immigration-related function of the United States;\n(b)  regulations related to agency organization, management, or personnel; or\n(c)  any other specific regulation or category of regulations exempted by the Director, who shall exempt those regulations or categories of regulations that impose minimal costs or burdens on the private sector or that are requested to be exempted by the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff or the Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy.\nSec. 6.  Implementation.  (a)  The Director is charged with implementing this order, including by providing agencies with updated guidance on implementing the ten-for-one rule described in section 3(a) of this order, including processes for identifying regulations for elimination, determining what constitutes, generally and specifically, a “rule” or “regulation” for purposes of this order, estimating and standardizing regulatory costs, and ensuring compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable laws.\n(b)  The Director shall revoke OMB Circular No. A-4 of November 9, 2023 (Regulatory Analysis), and all accompanying appendices, guidelines, and documents, and shall reinstate the prior version of Circular A-4, issued on September 17, 2003; and\n(c)  The Secretary of the Treasury and the Director shall reinstate the Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget of April 11, 2018, regarding review of tax regulations under Executive Order 12866.\nSec. 7.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nSec. 8.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 31, 2025."

    "content": "DEFENDING PARENTAL RIGHTS AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order expanding educational freedom and opportunity for families. It recognizes that parents, not the government, play a fundamental role in choosing and directing the upbringing and education of their children.\n- It directs the Department of Education to issue guidance on how the States can use federal funding formulas to support their K-12 scholarship programs.\n- It directs the Secretary of Education to prioritize school choice programs in the Department’s discretionary grant programs.\n- The Order requires the Department of Health and Human Services to issue guidance on how states receiving block grants for children and families can use those funds to support educational alternatives, including private and faith-based options.\n- It directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan to the President for how military families can use Department of Defense funds to send their children to the school of their choice.\n- The Order also directs the Secretary of the Interior to submit a plan to the President for how families with students attending Bureau of Indian Education schools can use federal funds to send their children to the school of their choice.\nEMPOWERING PARENTS AND STUDENTS THROUGH SCHOOL CHOICE: Every child deserves the best education available, regardless of their zip code. However, for generations, our government-assigned education system has failed millions of parents, students, and teachers. This Executive Order begins to rectify that wrong by opening up opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs.\n- According to the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 70% of 8th graders were below proficient in reading and 72% were below proficient in math. 40% of 4th graders did not even meet the basic reading levels.\n- Standardized test scores have essentially been flat for over 30 years, despite hundreds of billions of dollars spent on government-run education.\n- A dozen states have universal or near universal school choice programs and 33 states have some form of school choice program.\n- School choice programs have a strong record of improving students’ academic performance.\n- School choice has proven to be cost effective and saves taxpayer dollars.\n- Parents report higher levels of school safety for their children who participate in school choice programs.\n- Support for school choice is overwhelming, with 70% of Democrats, 73% of Black Americans, and 69% of Hispanic Americans in favor of it.\n- President Trump is dedicated to ensuring every child has the opportunity to receive a world-class education.\nFULFILLING THE PROMISE TO STRENGTHEN EDUCATION THROUGH FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY: President Trump promised to bring school choice to every family in the Nation. Today’s historic executive order is a critical step in delivering on that promise, and builds on the long list of accomplishments from the first Trump Administration, including:\n- Calling on Congress to pass the School Choice Now Act and the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act.\n- Providing in-person learning options for low-income parents forced to send their children to virtual school during the pandemic.\n- Re-authorizing the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship program twice.\n- Investing nearly $1.5 billion in the development of public charter schools, helping this innovative sector grow to 7,500 charter schools serving more than 3 million students.\n- Allowing parents across the nation to withdraw up to $10,000 tax-free per year from 529 education savings plans to cover public, private, or religious K-12 schooling costs, thanks to the President’s historic tax cuts.\nParents can be confident that under his Administration, President Trump will provide every available opportunity for parents to enrich the education of their children through individual choice."

Trump signed an Executive Order to Combat Anti-Semitism.\n- Expanding on his Executive Order 13899, President Trump’s new Order takes forceful and unprecedented steps to marshal all Federal resources to combat the explosion of anti-Semitism on our campuses and in our streets since October 7, 2023.\n- Every Federal executive department and agency leader will review and report to the White House within sixty days on all criminal and civil authorities and actions available for fighting anti-Semitism.\n- Immediate action will be taken by the Department of Justice to protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities.\n- The Order demands the removal of resident aliens who violate our laws.\nGOING ON OFFENSE TO ENFORCE LAW AND ORDER AND TO PROTECT CIVIL RIGHTS: Immediately after the jihadist terrorist attacks against the people of Israel on October 7, 2023, pro-Hamas aliens and left-wing radicals began a campaign of intimidation, vandalism, and violence on the campuses and streets of America.\n- Celebrating Hamas’ mass rape, kidnapping, and murder, they physically blocked Jewish Americans from attending college classes, obstructed synagogues and assaulted worshippers, and vandalized American monuments and statues.\n- The Biden Administration turned a blind eye to this coordinated assault on public order; it simply refused to protect the civil rights of Jewish Americans, especially students. According to a December 2024 U.S. House of Representatives Staff Report on anti-Semitism, “the failure of our federal government departments and agencies is astounding.”\nPRESIDENT TRUMP KEEPS HIS PROMISES AND BUILDS ON HIS SUCCESS: In his first term, President Trump kept his biggest promises:\n- He moved the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem: After decades of broken promises and despite much criticism, President Trump was the President who finally kept his commitment to Israel to move the American embassy from Tel-Aviv to Israel’s true and rightful capital: Jerusalem.\n- He established the Abraham Accords: President Trump delivered the greatest breakthrough for peace in the Middle East in decades by brokering the normalization of ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco, protecting Israel and Jews and spreading security and prosperity to the entire region.\nNow, President Trump has promised that the Federal Government will:\n- Protect the civil rights of our Jewish citizens: “My promise to Jewish Americans is this: With your vote, I will be your defender, your protector, and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.”\n- Aggressively enforce the law, protect public order, and prosecute anti-Semitic crimes: “I will issue clear orders to my Attorney General to aggressively prosecute terroristic threats, arson, vandalism and violence against American Jews.”\n- Deport Hamas Sympathizers and Revoke Student Visas: “To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you. I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.”"

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:Section 1.  Purpose.  My Administration has fought and will continue to fight anti-Semitism in the United States and around the world.  On December 11, 2019, I issued Executive Order 13899, my first Executive Order on Combating Anti-Semitism, finding that students, in particular, faced anti-Semitic harassment in schools and on university and college campuses.  Executive Order 13899 provided interpretive assistance on the enforcement of the Nation’s civil rights laws to ensure that they would protect American Jews to the same extent to which all other American citizens are protected.  The prior administration effectively nullified Executive Order 13899 by failing to give the terms of the order full force and effect throughout the Government.  This order reaffirms Executive Order 13899 and directs additional measures to advance the policy thereof in the wake of the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023, against the people of Israel.  These attacks unleashed an unprecedented wave of vile anti-Semitic discrimination, vandalism, and violence against our citizens, especially in our schools and on our campuses.  Jewish students have faced an unrelenting barrage of discrimination; denial of access to campus common areas and facilities, including libraries and classrooms; and intimidation, harassment, and physical threats and assault.  A joint report by the House Committees on Education and the Workforce, Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, Oversight and Accountability, Veterans’ Affairs, and Ways and Means calls the Federal Government’s failure to fight anti-Semitism and protect Jewish students “astounding.”  This failure is unacceptable and ends today. Sec. 2.  Policy.  It shall be the policy of the United States to combat anti-Semitism vigorously, using all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.Sec. 3.  Additional Measures to Combat Campus Anti-Semitism.  (a)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department or agency (agency) shall submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, identifying all civil and criminal authorities or actions within the jurisdiction of that agency, beyond those already implemented under Executive Order 13899, that might be used to curb or combat anti-Semitism, and containing an inventory and analysis of all pending administrative complaints, as of the date of the report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism.(b)  The report submitted by the Attorney General under this section shall additionally include an inventory and an analysis of all court cases, as of the date of the report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism and indicate whether the Attorney General intends to or has taken any action with respect to such matters, including filing statements of interest or intervention.(c)  The Attorney General is encouraged to employ appropriate civil-rights enforcement authorities, such as 18 U.S.C. 241, to combat anti-Semitism. (d)  The report submitted by the Secretary of Education under this section shall additionally include an inventory and an analysis of all Title VI complaints and administrative actions, including in K-12 education, related to anti-Semitism — pending or resolved after October 7, 2023 — within the Department’s Office for Civil Rights.(e)  In addition to identifying relevant authorities to curb or combat anti-Semitism generally required by this section, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with each other, shall include in their reports recommendations for familiarizing institutions of higher education with the grounds for inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3) so that such institutions may monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff relevant to those grounds and for ensuring that such reports about aliens lead, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to investigations and, if warranted, actions to remove such aliens.Sec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person."

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1.  Purpose and Policy.  Parents trust America’s schools to provide their children with a rigorous education and to instill a patriotic admiration for our incredible Nation and the values for which we stand.  In recent years, however, parents have witnessed schools indoctrinate their children in radical, anti-American ideologies while deliberately blocking parental oversight.  Such an environment operates as an echo chamber, in which students are forced to accept these ideologies without question or critical examination.  In many cases, innocent children are compelled to adopt identities as either victims or oppressors solely based on their skin color and other immutable characteristics.  In other instances, young men and women are made to question whether they were born in the wrong body and whether to view their parents and their reality as enemies to be blamed.  These practices not only erode critical thinking but also sow division, confusion, and distrust, which undermine the very foundations of personal identity and family unity.Imprinting anti-American, subversive, harmful, and false ideologies on our Nation’s children not only violates longstanding anti-discrimination civil rights law in many cases, but usurps basic parental authority.  For example, steering students toward surgical and chemical mutilation without parental consent or involvement or allowing males access to private spaces designated for females may contravene Federal laws that protect parental rights, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA), and sex-based equality and opportunity, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX).  Similarly, demanding acquiescence to “White Privilege” or “unconscious bias,” actually promotes racial discrimination and undermines national unity.My Administration will enforce the law to ensure that recipients of Federal funds providing K-12 education comply with all applicable laws prohibiting discrimination in various contexts and protecting parental rights, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI), 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.; Title IX, 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.; FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; and the PPRA, 20 U.S.C. 1232h.Sec. 2.  Definitions.  As used herein:(a)  The definitions in the Executive Order “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” (January 20, 2025) shall apply to this order.(b)  “Discriminatory equity ideology” means an ideology that treats individuals as members of preferred or disfavored groups, rather than as individuals, and minimizes agency, merit, and capability in favor of immoral generalizations, including that: (i)     Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin are morally or inherently superior to members of another race, color, sex, or national origin; (ii)    An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; (iii)   An individual’s moral character or status as privileged, oppressing, or oppressed is primarily determined by the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin; (iv)    Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to their race, color, sex, or national origin; (v)     An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin, bears responsibility for, should feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of, should be discriminated against, blamed, or stereotyped for, or should receive adverse treatment because of actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex, or national origin, in which the individual played no part; (vi)    An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin, should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment to achieve diversity, equity, or inclusion; (vii)   Virtues such as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, objectivity, and racial colorblindness are racist or sexist or were created by members of a particular race, color, sex, or national origin to oppress members of another race, color, sex, or national origin; or(viii)  the United States is fundamentally racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory.(c)  “Educational service agency” (ESA) has the meaning given in 20 U.S.C. 1401(5), and the terms “elementary school,” “local educational agency” (LEA), “secondary school,” and “state educational agency” (SEA) have the meanings given in 34 C.F.R. 77.1(c).(d)  “Patriotic education” means a presentation of the history of America grounded in: (i)    an accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling characterization of America’s founding and foundational principles; (ii)   a clear examination of how the United States has admirably grown closer to its noble principles throughout its history; (iii)  the concept that commitment to America’s aspirations is beneficial and justified; and(iv)   the concept that celebration of America’s greatness and history is proper.(e)  “Social transition” means the process of adopting a “gender identity” or “gender marker” that differs from a person’s sex.  This process can include psychological or psychiatric counseling or treatment by a school counselor or other provider; modifying a person’s name (e.g., “Jane” to “James”) or pronouns (e.g., “him” to “her”); calling a child “nonbinary”; use of intimate facilities and accommodations such as bathrooms or locker rooms  specifically designated for persons of the opposite sex; and participating in school athletic competitions or other extracurricular activities specifically designated for persons of the opposite sex.  “Social transition” does not include chemical or surgical mutilation.Sec. 3.  Ending Indoctrination Strategy.  (a)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, to advise the President in formulating future policy, the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall provide an Ending Indoctrination Strategy to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, containing recommendations and a plan for:(i)   eliminating Federal funding or support for illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology; and(ii)  protecting parental rights, pursuant to FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g, and the PPRA, 20 U.S.C. 1232h, with respect to any K-12 policies or conduct implicated by the purpose and policy of this order.(b)  The Ending Indoctrination Strategy submitted under subsection (a) of this section shall contain a summary and analysis of the following:(i)    All Federal funding sources and streams, including grants or contracts, that directly or indirectly support or subsidize the instruction, advancement, or promotion of gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology:(A)  in K-12 curriculum, instruction, programs, or activities; or (B)  in K-12 teacher education, certification, licensing, employment, or training; (ii)   Each agency’s process to prevent or rescind Federal funds, to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law, from being used by an ESA, SEA, LEA, elementary school, or secondary school to directly or indirectly support or subsidize the instruction, advancement, or promotion of gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology in: (A)  K-12 curriculum, instruction, programs, or activities; or (B)  K-12 teacher certification, licensing, employment, or training; (iii)  Each agency’s process to prevent or rescind Federal funds, to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law, from being used by an ESA, SEA, LEA, elementary school, or secondary school to directly or indirectly support or subsidize the social transition of a minor student, including through school staff or teachers or through deliberately concealing the minor’s social transition from the minor’s parents.(iv)   Each agency’s process to prevent or rescind Federal funds, to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law, from being used by an ESA, SEA, LEA, elementary school, or secondary school to directly or indirectly support or subsidize:(A)  interference with a parent’s Federal statutory right to information regarding school curriculum, records, physical examinations, surveys, and other matters under the PPRA or FERPA; or (B)  a violation of Title VI or Title IX; and(v)    A summary and analysis of all relevant agency enforcement tools to advance the policies of this order.    (c)  The Attorney General shall coordinate with State attorneys general and local district attorneys in their efforts to enforce the law and file appropriate actions against K-12 teachers and school officials who violate the law by:(i)    sexually exploiting minors; (ii)   unlawfully practicing medicine by offering diagnoses and treatment without the requisite license; or(iii)  otherwise unlawfully facilitating the social transition of a minor student.(d)  The Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall regularly convene the heads of the agencies tasked with submitting the Ending Indoctrination Strategy under subsection (a) of this section to confer regarding their findings, areas for additional investigation, the modification or implementation of their respective recommendations, and such other policy initiatives or matters as the President may direct. Sec. 4.  Reestablishing the President’s Advisory 1776 Commission and Promoting Patriotic Education.  (a)  The President’s Advisory 1776 Commission (“1776 Commission”), which was created by Executive Order 13958 of November 2, 2020, to promote patriotic education, but was terminated by President Biden in Executive Order 13985 of January 20, 2021, is hereby reestablished.  The purpose of the 1776 Commission is to promote patriotic education and advance the purposes stated in section 1 of Executive Order 13958, as well as to advise and promote the work of the White House Task Force on Celebrating America’s 250th Birthday (“Task Force 250”) and the United States Semiquincentennial Commission in their efforts to provide a grand celebration worthy of the momentous occasion of the 250th anniversary of American Independence on July 4, 2026.(b)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Education shall establish the 1776 Commission in the Department of Education.(c)  The 1776 Commission shall be composed of not more than 20 members, who shall be appointed by the President for a term of 2 years.  The 1776 Commission shall be made up of individuals from outside the Federal Government with relevant experience or subject-matter expertise.  (d)  The 1776 Commission shall have a Chair or Co-Chairs, at the President’s discretion, and a Vice Chair, who shall be designated by the President from among the Commission’s members.  An Executive Director, designated by the Secretary of Education in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, shall coordinate the work of the 1776 Commission.  The Chair (or Co-Chairs) and Vice Chair shall work with the Executive Director to convene regular meetings of the 1776 Commission, determine its agenda, and direct its work, consistent with this order.(e)  The 1776 Commission shall:(i)    facilitate the development and implementation of a “Presidential 1776 Award” to recognize student knowledge of the American founding, including knowledge about the Founders, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitutional Convention, and the great soldiers and battles of the American Revolutionary War;(ii)   in coordination with the White House Office of Public Liaison, coordinate bi-weekly lectures regarding the 250th anniversary of American Independence that are grounded in patriotic education principles, which shall be broadcast to the Nation throughout calendar year 2026; (iii)  upon request, advise executive departments and agencies regarding their efforts to ensure patriotic education is appropriately provided to the public at national parks, battlefields, monuments, museums, installations, landmarks, cemeteries, and other places important to the American founding and American history, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law; (iv)   upon request, offer advice and recommendations to, and support the work of Task Force 250 and the United States Semiquincentennial Commission regarding their plans to celebrate the 250th anniversary of American Independence;

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to improve the education, well-being, and future success of America’s most prized resource, her young citizens, it is hereby ordered:Section 1.  Purpose.  Parents want and deserve the best education for their children.  But too many children do not thrive in their assigned, government-run K-12 school.  According to this year’s National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 70 percent of 8th graders were below proficient in reading, and 72 percent were below proficient in math.  Moreover, geographically based school assignments exacerbate the cost of housing in districts with preferred schools, straining the finances of millions of American families sacrificing for their children’s futures. When our public education system fails such a large segment of society, it hinders our national competitiveness and devastates families and communities.  For this reason, more than a dozen States have enacted universal K-12 scholarship programs, allowing families — rather than the government — to choose the best educational setting for their children.  These States have highlighted the most promising avenue for education reform:  educational choice for families and competition for residentially assigned, government-run public schools.  The growing body of rigorous research demonstrates that well-designed education-freedom programs improve student achievement and cause nearby public schools to improve their performance. Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of my Administration to support parents in choosing and directing the upbringing and education of their children. Sec. 3.  Guidance on Supporting State-based K-12 Educational Choice.  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Education shall issue guidance regarding how States can use Federal formula funds to support K-12 educational choice initiatives.Sec. 4.  Encouraging Education Freedom through Discretionary Grant Programs.  (a)  The Secretary of Education shall include education freedom as a priority in discretionary grant programs, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. (b)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education shall review their respective discretionary grant programs and each submit a plan to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, that identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendations regarding using relevant discretionary grant programs to expand education freedom for America’s families and teachers. Sec. 5.  Expanding Opportunities for Low-Income, Working Families.  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall issue guidance regarding whether and how States receiving block grants for families and children from the Department, including the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDGB), can use them to expand educational choice and support families who choose educational alternatives to governmental entities, including private and faith-based options.Sec. 6.  Helping Military Families.  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall review any available mechanisms under which military-connected families may use funds from the Department of Defense to attend schools of their choice, including private, faith-based, or public charter schools, and submit a plan to the President describing such mechanisms and the steps that would be necessary to implement them beginning in the 2025-26 school year.Sec. 7.  Helping Children Eligible for Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) Schools.  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall review any available mechanisms under which families of students eligible to attend BIE schools may use their Federal funding for educational options of their choice, including private, faith-based, or public charter schools, and submit a plan to the President describing such mechanisms and the steps that would be necessary to implement them for the 2025-26 school year.  The Secretary shall report on the current performance of BIE schools and identify educational options in nearby areas.  Sec. 8.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person."

    "content": "1:06 P.M. EST\nMS. LEAVITT:  Good afternoon, everybody.\nQ    Good afternoon.\nMS. LEAVITT:  How are we?  Good to see all of you.  It’s an honor to be here with all of you.  A lot of familiar faces in the room, a lot of new faces.\nAnd President Trump is back, and the golden age of America has most definitely begun.\nThe Senate has already confirmed five of President Trump’s exceptional Cabinet nominees: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.  It is imperative that the Senate continues to confirm the remainder of the president’s well-qualified nominees as quickly as possible.\nAs you have seen during the past week, President Trump is hard at work fulfilling the promises that he made to the American people on the campaign trail.  Since taking the oath of office, President Trump has taken more than 300 executive actions; secured nearly $1 trillion in U.S. investments; deported illegal alien rapists, gang members, and suspected terrorists from our homeland; and restored common sense to the federal government.\nI want to take a moment to go through some of these extraordinary actions.\nOn day one, President Trump declared a national emergency at our southern border to end the four-year-long invasion of illegal aliens under the previous administration.  Additionally, President Trump signed an executive order to end catch and release and finish construction of his effective border wall.  By using every lever of his federal power, President Trump has sent a loud and clear message to the entire world: America will no longer tolerate illegal immigration.\nAnd this president expects that every nation on this planet will cooperate with the repatriation of their citizens, as proven by this weekend, when President Trump swiftly directed his team to issue harsh and effective sanctions and tariffs on the Colombian government upon hearing they were denied a U.S. military aircraft full of their own citizens who were deported by this administration.  Within hours, the Colombian government agreed to all of President Trump’s demands, proving America is once again respected on the world stage.\nSo, to foreign nationals who are thinking about trying to illegally enter the United States, think again.  Under this president, you will be detained, and you will be deported.      Every day, Americans are safer because of the violent criminals that President Trump’s administration is removing from our communities.\nOn January 23rd, ICE New York arrested a Turkish national for entry without inspection who is a known or suspected terrorist.  On January 23rd, ICE San Francisco arrested a citizen of Mexico unlawfully present in the United States who has been convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child aged 14 years or younger.  ICE Saint Paul has arrested a citizen of Honduras who was convicted of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor.  ICE Buffalo arrested a citizen of Ecuador who has been convicted of rape.\nICE Boston arrested a citizen of the Dominican Republic who has a criminal conviction for second-degree murder.  This criminal was convicted of murder for beating his pregnant wife to death in front of her five-year-old son.      And ICE Saint Paul also arrested a citizen of Mexico who was convicted of possessing pornographic material of a minor on a work computer.\nThese are the heinous individuals that this administration is removing from American communities every single day.  And to the brave state and local law enforcement officers, CBP, and ICE agents who are helping in the facilitation of this deportation operation, President Trump has your back and he is grateful for your hard work.\nOn the economic front, President Trump took immediate action to lower costs for families who are suffering from four long years of the Biden administration’s destructive and inflationary policies.  President Trump ordered the heads of all executive departments and agencies to help deliver emergency price relief to the American people, untangle our economy from Biden’s regulatory constraints, and end the reckless war on American energy.\nPresident Trump also signed sweeping executive orders to end the weaponization of government and restore common sense to the federal bureaucracy.  He directed all federal agencies to terminate illegal diversity, equity, and inclusion programs to help return America to a merit-based society.\nPresident Trump also signed an executive order declaring it is now the policy of the federal government that there are only two sexes: male and female.  Sanity has been restored.\nBefore I take your questions, I would like to point out to — all of you once again have access to the most transparent and accessible president in American history.  There has never been a president who communicates with the American people and the American press corps as openly and authentically as the 45th and now 47th president of the United States.\nThis past week, President Trump has held multiple news conferences, gaggled on Air Force One multiple times, and sat down for a two-part interview on Fox News, which aired last week.  As Politico summed it up best, “Trump is everywhere again,” and that’s because President Trump has a great story to tell about the legendary American revival that is well underway.\nAnd in keeping with this revolutionary media approach that President Trump deployed during the campaign, the Trump White House will speak to all media outlets and personalities, not just the legacy media who are seated in this room, because apporting — according to recent polling from Gallup, Americans’ trust in mass media has fallen to a record low.  Millions of Americans, especially young people, have turned from traditional television outlets and newspapers to consume their news from podcasts, blogs, social media, and other independent outlets.\nIt’s essential to our team that we share President Trump’s message everywhere and adapt this White House to the new media landscape in 2025.  To do this, I am excited to announce the following changes will be made to this historic James S. Brady Briefing Room, where Mr. Brady’s legacy will endure.\nThis White House believes strongly in the First Amendment, so it’s why our team will work diligently to restore the press passes of the 440 journalists whose passes were wrongly revoked by the previous administration.\nWe’re also opening up this briefing room to new media voices who produce news-related content and whose outlet is not already represented by one of the seats in this room.  We welcome independent journalists, podcasters, social media influencers, and content creators to apply for credentials to cover this White House.  And you can apply now on our new website, WhiteHouse.gov/NewMedia.\nStarting today, this seat in the front of the room, which is usually occupied by the press secretary staff, will be called the “new media” seat.  My team will review the applications and give credentials to new media applicants who meet our criteria and pass United States Secret Service requirements to enter the White House complex.\nSo, in light of these announcements, our first questions for today’s briefing will go to these new media members whose outlets, despite being some of the most viewed news websites in the country, have not been given seats in this room.\nAnd before I turn to questions, I do have news directly from the president of the United States that was just shared with me in the Oval Office from President Trump directly — an update on the New Jersey drones: After research and study, the drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons.\nMany of these drones were also hobbyists — recreational and private individuals that enjoy flying drones.  In meanti- — in the — in time, it got worse, due to curiosity.  This was not the enemy.  A — a statement from the president of the United States to start this briefing with some news.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to questions, and we will begin with our new media members: Mike Allen from Axios, Matt Boyle from Breitbart.      Mike, why don’t you go ahead.\nQ    Thank you very much.  Karoline, does the president see anything fishy about DeepSeek, either its origins or its cost?  And could China’s ability to make these models quicker, cheaper affect our thinking about expanding generation data centers, chip manufacturing?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Sure.  The president was asked about DeepSeek last night on Air Force One when he gaggled for, I think, the third or fourth time throughout the weekend with members of the traveling press corps.  The president said that he believes that this is a wake-up call to the American AI industry.  The last administration sat on their hands and allowed China to rapidly develop this AI program.\nAnd so, President Trump believes in restoring American AI dominance, and that’s why he took very strong executive action this past week to sign executive orders to roll back some of the onerous regulations on the AI industry.  And President Trump has also proudly appointed the first AI and crypto czar at this White House, David Sacks, whom I spoke with yesterday — very knowledgeable on this subject.  And his team is here working every single day to ensure American AI dominance.\nAs for the national security implications, I spoke with NSC this morning.  They are looking into what those may be, and when I have an update, I will share it with you, Mike.\nQ    And, Karoline, you say “restore” U.S. dominance.  Is there fear that the U.S. either is falling or has fallen behind?  And how would the president make sure the U.S. stays ahead?\nMS. LEAVITT:  No.  The president is confident that we will restore American dominance in AI.\nMatt.\nQ    Yeah.  So, Karoline, first off, thank you to you and President Trump for actually giving voices to new media outlets that represent millions and millions of Americans.  The thing I would add — the — I’ve got a two-part question for you.  The first is just: Can you expand upon what steps the White House is going to take to bring more voices, not less — which is what our founder, Andrew Breitbart, believed in — into this room, where they rightly belong?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah, absolutely.  And as I said in my opening statement, Matt, it is a priority of this White House to honor the First Amendment.  And it is a fact that Americans are consuming their news media from various different platforms, especially young people.  And as the youngest press secretary in history, thanks to President Trump, I take great pride in opening up this room to new media voices to share the president’s message with as many Americans as possible.\nIn doing so, number one, we will ensure that outlets like yours — Axios and Breitbart, which are widely respected and viewed outlets — have an actual seat in this room every day.  We also, again, encourage anybody in this country — whether you are a TikTok content creator, a blogger, a podcaster — if you are producing legitimate news content, no matter the medium, you will be allowed to apply for press credentials to this White House.\nAnd as I said earlier, our new media website is WhiteHouse.gov/NewMedia, and so we encourage people to apply.  Again, as long as you are creating news-related content of the day and you’re a legitimate independent journalist, you’re welcome to cover this White House.\nQ    And secondly, Karoline, you sa- — you laid out several of the actions that President Trump has taken.  Obviously, it’s a stark contrast to the previous administration and a breakneck speed from President Trump.  Can we expect that pace to continue as the hun- — the — you know, the first 100 days moves along here and beyond that?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Absolutely.  There is no doubt President Trump has always been the hardest working man in politics.  I think that’s been proven over the past week.  This president has, again, signed more than 300 executive orders.  He’s taken historic action.\nI gaggled aboard Air Force One to mark the first 100 days of this administration — 4:00 p.m. last Friday — first 100 hours, rather.  And this president did more in the first 100 hours than the previous president did in the first 100 days.\nSo, President Trump, I think you can all expect to — for him to continue to work at this breakneck speed.  So, I hope you’re all ready to work very hard.  I know that we are.\nZeke Miller.\nQ    Thanks, Karoline.  A question that we’ve asked your predecessors of both parties in this job.  When you’re up here in this briefing room speaking to the American public, do you view yourself and your role as speaking on — advocating on behalf of the president, or providing the unvarnished truth that is, you know, not to lie, not to obfuscate to the American people?\nMS. LEAVITT:  I commit to telling the truth from this podium every single day.  I commit to speaking on behalf of the president of the United States.  That is my job.\nAnd I will say it’s very easy to speak truth from this podium when you have a president who is implementing policies that are wildly popular with the American people, and that’s exactly what this administration is doing.  It’s correcting the lies and the wrongs of the past four years, many of the lies that have been told to your faces in this very briefing room.  I will not do that.\nBut since you brought up truth, Zeke, I would like to point out, while I vow to provide the truth from this podium, we ask that all of you in this room hold yourselves to that same standard.  We know for a fact there have been lies that have been pushed by many legacy media outlets in this country about this president, about his family, and we will not accept that.  We will call you out when we feel that your reporting is wrong or there is misinformation about this White House.\nSo, yes, I will hold myself to the truth, and I expect everyone in this room to do the same.\nQ    And, Karoline, just on a substantive question.  Yesterday, the White House Office of Management and Budget directed an across-the-board freeze with — with some exceptions for individual assistance.  We understand just federal grants.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Right.\nQ    It’s caused a lot of confusion around the country among Head Start providers, among providers — from services to homeless veterans, provid- — you know, Medicaid providers, states saying they’re having trouble accessing the portal.  Could you put — help us clear up some confusion —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yes.\nQ    — give some certainty to folks?  And then also, is that uncertainty — how does that uncertainty service the president’s voters?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Well, I think there’s only uncertainty in this room amongst the media.  There’s no uncertainty in this building.\nSo, let me provide the certainty and the clarity that all of you need.  This is not a blanket pause on federal assistance in grant programs from the Trump administration.  Individual assistance, that includes — I’m not naming everything that’s included, but just to give you a few examples — Social Security benefits, Medicare benefits, food stamps, welfare benefits — assistance that is going directly to individuals will not be impacted by this pause.\nAnd I want to make that very clear to any Americans who are watching at home who may be a little bit confused about some of the media reporting: This administration — if you are receiving individual assistance from the federal government, you will still continue to receive that.\nHowever, it is the responsibility of this president and this administration to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.  That is something that President Trump campaigned on.  That’s why he has launched DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, who is working alongside OMB.  And that’s why OMB sent out this memo last night, because the president signed an executive order directing OMB to do just this.  And the reason for this is to ensure that every penny that is going out the door is not conflicting with the executive orders and actions that this president has taken.\nSo, what does this pause mean?  It means no more funding for illegal DEI programs.  It means no more funding for the Green New Scam that has ta- — cost American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.  It means no more funding for transgenderism and wokeness across our federal bureaucracy and agencies.  No more funding for Green New Deal social engineering policies.  Again, people who are receiving individual asintan- — assistance, you will continue to receive that.\nAnd President Trump is looking out for you by issuing this pause because he is being good steward of your taxpayer dollars.\nQ    Thanks, Karoline.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Sure.\nQ    How long is this pause going to last?  And how is the Trump administration recommending that organizations that rely on federal funding make payroll, pay their rent in the meantime?\nMS. LEAVITT:  It is a temporary pause, and the Office of Management and Budget is reviewing the federal funding that has been going out the door, again, not for individual assistance, but for all of these other programs that I mentioned.\nI also spoke with the incoming director of OMB this morning, and he told me to tell all of you that the line to his office is open for other federal government agencies across the board, and if they feel that programs are necessary and in line with the president’s agenda, then the Office of Management and Budget will review those policies.\nI think this is a very responsible measure.  Again, the past four years, we’ve seen the Biden administration spend money like drunken sailors.  It’s a big reason we’ve had an inflation crisis in this country, and it’s incumbent upon this administration to make sure, again, that every penny is being accounted for honestly.\nQ    Why impose this pause with so little notice?  Why not give organizations more time to plan for the fact that they are about to lose, in some cases, really crucial federal funding —\nMS. LEAVITT:  There was —\nQ    — at least for a — for a period of time?\nMS. LEAVITT:  There was notice.  It was the executive order that the president signed.\nThere’s also a freeze on hiring, as you know; a regulatory freeze; and there’s also a freeze on foreign aid.  And this is a — again, incredibly important to ensure that this administration is taking into consideration how hard the American people are working.  And their tax dollars actually matter to this administration.\nYou know, just during this pause, DOGE and OMB have actually found that there was $37 million that was about to go out the door to the World Health Organization, which is an organization, as you all know, that President Trump, with the swipe of his pen in that executive order, is — no longer wants the United States to be a part of.  So, that wouldn’t be in line with the president’s agenda.\nDOGE and OMB also found that there was about to be 50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.  That is a preposterous waste of taxpayer money.\nSo, that’s what this pause is focused on: being good stewards of tax dollars.\nQ    And so, this doesn’t affect —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Jennifer.\nQ    — Meals on Wheels or Head Start or disaster aid?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Again, it does not affect individual assistance that’s going to Americans.\nQ    To follow up on Nancy, do you think there will be a list of who is affected and how much money is affected?  How — how will these contractors and organizations know if they are actually being — having their funding frozen?\nAnd then, secondly, if you’re willing, can you just clarify, is the end goal of this to essentially challenge Congress or to — to prove that the president can withhold federal funding?  Is — in other words, is this an attempt to pick a fight to prove that he can do this?\nMS. LEAVITT:  No, absolutely not.  As it says right here in the memo, which I have — and I’d encourage all of you to read it — it says, “The American people elected President Trump to be the president of the United States and gave him a mandate to increase the impact of every federal dollar.”  “This memo requires federal agencies to identify and review all Federal financial assistance programs and supporting activities consistent with the president’s policies and requirements.”\nThe American people gave President Trump an overwhelming mandate on November 5th, and he’s just trying to ensure that the tax money going out the door in this very bankrupt city actually aligns with the will and the priorities of the American people.\n(Cross-talk.)\nBrian Glenn.\nQ    Yes.  Welcome.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Thank you.\nQ    You look great.  You’re doing a great job.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Thank you.\nQ    You talked about transparency.  And some of us in this room know how just transparent President Trump has been the last five or six years; I think you’ll do the same.\nMy question is, do you think this latest incident with the president of Colombia is indicative of the global, powerful respect they have for President Trump moving forward not only to engage in — in economic diplomacy with these countries but also world peace?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Absolutely.  I’ll echo the answer that the president gave on Air Force One last night when he was asked a very similar question by one of your colleagues in the media: This signifies peace through strength is back, and this president will not tolerate illegal immigration into America’s interior.\nAnd he expects every nation on this planet, again, to cooperate with the repatriation of their citizens who illegally entered into our country and broke America’s laws.  Won’t be tolerated.\nAnd as you saw, the Colombian government quickly folded and agreed to all of President Trump’s demands.  Flights are underway once again.\n(Cross-talk.)\nDiana.\nQ    Two questions on deportations, if I may.  President Trump had said on the campaign trail that he would deport pro-Hamas students who are here on visas, and on his first day in office, he signed an executive order that said, quote, “The U.S. must ensure that admitted aliens and aliens otherwise already present in the U.S. do not bear hostile attitudes toward its citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles.”  So, should we take this executive order as Trump saying he would be open to de- — deporting those students who are here on visas, but, you know, hold pro-Hamas sympathies?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The president is open to deporting individuals who have broken our nation’s immigrations laws.  So, if they are here illegally, then certainly he is open to deporting them, and that’s what this administration is hard at work at doing.\nWe receive data from DHS and from ICE every single day.  From what we hear on the ground, ICE agents are feeling incredibly empowered right now because they actually have a leader in this building who is supporting them in doing their jobs that they were hired to do, which is to detain, arrest, and deport illegal criminals who have invaded our nation’s borders over the past four years.  That’s what the president is committed to seeing.\nQ    One more.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Peter.         Q    Just following up on that, Karoline —\nQ    Karoline, if I could ask you very quickly, just following up on the question on immigration.  First, President Trump, during the course of the campaign in 2024, said the following about illegal im- — immigration.  He said, “They’re going back home where they belong, and we start with the criminals.  There are many, many criminals.”  NBC News has learned that ICE arrested 1,179 undocumented immigrants on Sunday, but nearly half of them — 566 of the migrants — appear to have no prior criminal record besides entering the country illegally.\nMS. LEAVITT:  (Laughs.)\nQ    Is the president still focused exclusiv- — which is a civil crime, not a — not a — it’s not criminal —\nMS. LEAVITT:  It’s a federal crime.\nQ    It’s a fed- — so, I’m asking though, he said he was going to focus on those violent offenders first.  So, is violent offenders no longer the predicate for these people to be deported?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The president has said countless times on the campaign trail — I’ve been with him at the rallies; I know you’ve been there covering them too, Peter — that he is focused on launching the largest mass deportation operation in American history of illegal criminals.\nAnd if you are an individual, a foreign national, who illegally enters the United States of America, you are, by definition, a criminal.  And so, therefore —\nQ    So, to be clear, it’s not exclusively —\nMS. LEAVITT:  — you are subject deportation.\nQ    I apologize for interrupting.  So, to be clear, it’s not — violent criminals do not receive precedence in terms of the deportations taking place?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The president has also said — two things can be true at the same time.  We want to deport illegal criminals, illegal immigrants from this country.  But the president has said that, of course, the illegal dr- — criminal drug dealers, the rapists, the murderers, the individuals who have committed heinous acts on the interior of our country and who have terrorized law-abiding American citizens, absolutely, those should be the priority of ICE.  But that doesn’t mean that the other illegal criminals who entered our nation’s borders are off the table.\nQ    Understood.  Then let me ask you a separate question about the confusion that still exists across the country right now as it relates to the — the freeze — or the pause, as it’s described.  President Trump, of course, ran — one of the key policy items was that he was going to lower prices, lower the cost of everything from groceries, as he often said.  But in many of the cases, it would seem that some of these moves could raise prices for real Americans on everything from low-income heating — that program; childcare programs.  Will nothing that the president is doing here, in terms of the freeze in these programs, raise prices on ordinary Americans?\nMS. LEAVITT:  What particular actions are you referring to that would —\nQ    I’m referring to LHEAP right now.  That’s the low-income heating program, for example.  We can talk about — there’s no clarity, so I could refer to a lot of them.  We don’t know what they are specifically.  Can you tell us that LHEAP — that LIHEAP is not one of those affected?\nMS. LEAVITT:  So, you’re asking a hypoc- — -thetical based on programs that you can’t even identify?\nQ    No, I just identified — I —\nMS. LEAVITT:  What I can tell you is that the —\nQ    Well, just to be — just to be clear, since you guys haven’t identified, let’s do it together, just for Americans at home.  Medicaid, is that affected?\nMS. LEAVITT:  I gave you a list of examples — Social Security, Medicare, welfare benefits —\nQ    Medicaid too, correct?\nMS. LEAVITT:  — food stamps — that will not be impacted by this federal pause.  I can get you the full list after this briefing from the Office of Management and Budget.\nBut I do want to address the cost cutting, because that’s certainly very important, and — and cutting the cost of living in this country.  President Trump has taken historic action over the past week to do that.  He actually signed a memorandum to deliver emergency price relief for American families, which took a number of actions.  I can walk you through those.\nHe also repealed many onerous Biden administration regulations.  We know, over the past four years, American households has been essentially taxed $55,000 in regulations from the previous administration.  President Trump, with the swipe of his pen, rescinded those, which will ultimately put more money back in the pockets of the American people.  So, deregulation is a big deal.\nAnd then, when it comes to energy, I mean, the president signed an executive order to declare a national energy emergency here at home, which is going to make America energy dominant.  We know that energy is one of the number-one drivers of inflation, and so that’s why the president wants to increase our energy supply: to bring down costs for Americans.  The Trump energy boom is incoming, and Americans can expect that.\nQ    Please share that memo.  Thank you.\nMS. LEAVITT:  I will.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Karoline, I think — some of the confusion, I think, may be here with this pause on federal funding.  You’ve made it clear you’re not stopping funds that go directly to individuals, but there certainly are lots of organizations that receive funding and then may pass along a benefit — Meals on Wheels, for one.  They provide meals for over 2.2 million seniors.\nWhat is the president’s message to Americans out there, many of whom supported him and voted for him, who are concerned that this is going to impact them directly, even if, as you said, the funding isn’t coming directly to their wallet?\nMS. LEAVITT:  I have now been asked and answered this question four times.  To individuals at home who receive direct assistance from the federal government, you will not be impacted by this federal freeze.  In fact, OMB just sent out a memo to Capitol Hill with Q and A to — to clarify some of the questions and the answers that all of you are a- — are asking me right now.\nAgain, direct assistance will not be impacted.  I’ve been asked and answered about this OMB memo.  There’s many other topics of the day.\nJacqui Heinrich.\nQ    But on indirect assistance, Karoline —\nQ    Thank you, Karoline.\nQ    — if it’s going to another organization and then trickling down?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Direct assistance that is in the hands of the American people will not be impacted.\nAgain, as I said to Peter, we will continue to provide that list as it comes to fruition.  But OMB right now is focused on analyzing the federal government’s spending, which is exactly what the American people elected President Trump to do.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Thank you, Karoline.\nQ    And one question on immigration, Karoline.  On immigration.\nQ    Thank you, Karo- —\nQ    Of the 3,500 arrests ICE has made so far since President Trump came back into office, can you just tell us the numbers?  How many have a criminal record versus those who are just in the country illegally.\nMS. LEAVITT:  All of them, because they illegally broke our nation’s laws, and, therefore, they are criminals, as far as this administration goes.  I know the last administration didn’t see it that way, so it’s a big culture shift in our nation to view someone who breaks our immigration laws as a criminal.  But that’s exactly what they are.\nJacqui.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Karoline, on tariffs.\nQ    But you made a point of going with the worst first.\nQ    On tariffs.\nQ    They all have a criminal record?\nQ    And welcome to the briefing room.\nMS. LEAVITT:  If they broke our nation’s laws, yes, they are a criminal.\nYes.\nQ    Thank you.  On stripping security details for figures like John Bolton, Pompeo, Brian Hook.  Senator Tom Cotton said that he’s seen the intelligence and the threat from Iran is real for anyone who played a role in the Soleimani strike.  He voiced concern it wouldn’t just impact those individuals but potentially their family, innocent bystanders, friends — anyone who is near them when they’re out in public.  Is the president open to reconsidering his decision?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The president was asked and answered this yesterday, and he was firm in his decision, despite some of the comments that you had referenced.  And he’s made it very clear that he does not believe American taxpayers should fund security details for individuals who have served in the government for the rest of their lives.  And there’s nothing stopping these individuals that you mentioned from obtaining private security.\nThat’s where the president stands on it.  I have no updates on that.\nQ    Is there any concern that this decision might jeopardize the administration’s ability to hire the best advisers for these kinds of positions in the future?\nMS. LEAVITT:  No.  In fact, I’ve talked to the Presidential Personnel Office who has told me directly that there is such an influx of resumes for this administration that it’s incredibly overwhelming.  There is no lack of talent for the Trump administration.\nReagan Ree- —\nQ    And would he — would he take any responsibility —\nQ    Thanks, Karoline.\nQ    — if anything happened to these people?  Would he feel at all that his decision was a factor in that?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The president was asked and answered this yesterday.  I’d defer you to his comments.\nQ    Thanks, Karoline.\nQ    Karoline —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Reagan, since you’re in the back row, I hear y- — the back row hasn’t gotten much attention in the last four years —\nQ    Yes, thank you.\nMS. LEAVITT:  — so I’m happy to answer your question.\nQ    And I can project.  (Laughter.)\nDoes the president intend to permanently cut off funding to NGOs that are bringing illegal foreign nationals to the country, such as Catholic Charities?\nMS. LEAVITT:  I am actually quite certain that the president signed an executive order that did just that, and I can point you to that.\nQ    One more, Karoline.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah.\nQ    President Trump issued an executive order on increased vetting for refugees in visa applications.\nMS. LEAVITT:  That’s right.\nQ    Part of that order was considering an outright ban for countries that have deficient screening processes.  Has the president considered yet which countries might fall into this category?  Are countries like Afghanistan or Syria under consideration for a full ban?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah.  So, the president signed an executive order to streamline the vetting for visa applicants and for illegal immigrants in this country who are coming, of course, from other nations.\nIt also directed the secretary of State to review the process and make sure that other countries around the world are being completely transparent with our nation and the individuals that they are sending here.  And so, the secretary of State has been directed to report back to the president.  I haven’t seen that report yet.  We’ve only been here for a few days.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Karoline, two questions for you.  One on the freeze in federal funding.  Who advised the president on the legality of telling government agencies that they don’t have to spend money that was already appropriated by Congress?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Well, as the OMB memo states, this is certainly within the confines of the law.\nSo, White House Counsel’s Office believes that this is within the pe- — president’s power to do it, and therefore, he’s doing it.\nQ    Okay.  So, they disagree with lawmakers who say that they don’t have the power to — to freeze this funding?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Again, I would point you to the language in the memo that clearly states this is within the law.\nQ    And on what happened on Friday night.  The — the administration fired several inspectors general without giving Congress the 30-day legally required notification that they were being fired.  I think only two were left at DO- — DHS and the DOJ.  And then, yesterday, we saw several prosecutors — I believe 12 — fired from the Justice Department who worked on the investigations into the president.  As you know, they are career prosecutors; therefore, they are afforded civil service protections.  How is the administration deciding which laws to follow and which ones to ignore?\nMS. LEAVITT:  So, it is the belief of this White House and the White House Counsel’s Office that the president was within his exe- — executive authority to do that.  He is the executive of the executive branch, and, therefore, he has the power to fire anyone within the executive branch that he wishes to.\nThere’s also a case that went before the Supreme Court in 2020: Scaila [Seila] Law LLC, v. the Customs — the [Consumer Financial Protection] Bureau Protection.  I would advise you to look at that case, and that’s the legality that this White House has rested on.\nQ    So, you’re confident that if they bring lawsuits against you — those prosecutors who were fired — that — that they will succeed?\nMS. LEAVITT:  We will win in court, yes.\nQ    And did he personally direct this, given they worked on the classified documents investigation and the election interference investigation?\nMS. LEAVITT:  This was a memo that went out by the Presidential Personnel Office, and the president is the leader of this White House.  So, yes.\nQ    So, it did come from him?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yes, it came from this White House.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Karoline.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Sir.\nQ    Thank you.  Congrats on your first day behind the podium.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Thank you.\nQ    President Trump ended funding for UNRWA and also designated the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization.\nMS. LEAVITT:  That’s right.\nQ    Both were decisions that the previous administration had reversed.  So, here’s my question: Will there be an investigation into who gave the previous administration this terrible advice?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Well, that’s a very good point.  I haven’t heard discussions about such an ins- — investigation, but it wouldn’t be a bad idea, considering that the Houthis cer- — certainly are terrorists.  They have launched attacks on U.S. naval ships across this world, and so I think it was a very wise move by this administration to redesignate them as a terrorist group, because they are.  And I think it was a foolish decision by the previous administration to do so.\nAs for an investigation, I’m not sure about that, but it’s not a bad idea.\n(Cross-talk.)\nJosh.\nQ    Thank you for the question.  I appreciate it.  Can you give us an update on the president’s plan for his tariff agenda?  He spoke a lot about this yesterday, and there’s a couple of dates coming up that —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Sure.\nQ    — he’s spoken to.  Number one, February 1st.  He’s alluded to both the potential for tariffs for Canada and Mexico but also China to take effect on those days.  Where is — what’s he thinking about that?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah.\nQ    Should those countries expect that on the 1st?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Again, he was asked and answered this question this past weekend when he took a lot of questions from the press, and he said that the February 1st date for Canada and Mexico still holds.\nQ    And what about the China 10 percent tariff that he also had mused about last Tuesday going into effect on the same date?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah, the president has said that he is very much still considering that for February 1st.\nQ    And then, separately, yesterday, he talked also about sectoral tariffs on, for instance, pharmaceuticals, as well as semiconductor computer chips.  He talked about steel, aluminum, and copper.  What’s the timeline on those?  Is that a similar sort of “coming days” thing or —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah, so when the president talked about that in his speech yesterday, that actually wasn’t a new announcement.  That was within a presidential memorandum that he signed in one of the first days here in the White House on his America First trade agenda.  So, there’s more details on those tariffs in there.\nAs far as a date, I don’t have a specific date to read out to you, but the president is committed to implementing tariffs effectively, just like he did in his first term.\nQ    And then — and then, finally, he also was asked on the plane when he gaggled about the potential for a universal tariff.  He was asked maybe about two and a half percent.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah.\nQ    There was a report about that.  He said he wanted “much bigger than that.”  Should we understand that these tariffs would add up?  You know, in other words, you might have country-specific tariffs like Canada, Mexico, China.  You might have sectoral tariffs, like on pharmaceuticals, as well as a potential universal tariff on top of that.  Do these stack on one or the other, or would one sort of take precedence over another?\nMS. LEAVITT:  All I can point you to is what the president has said on this front: the February 1st date for Canada and Mexico and also the China tariff that he has discussed.\nHe rejected the 2.5 percent tariff.  He said that was a little bit too low.  He wants it to be higher.\nI’ll leave it to him to make any decisions on that front.\nQ    Do you have any comment on what the —\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    — what the Mexicans and Canadians —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Phil.\nQ    — have done so far?  Do you have any comment on whether that has met the bar of what he wants to see on fentanyl?  Thank you.\nMS. LEAVITT:   I — I won’t get ahead of the president, again, on advocating to foreign nations on what they should or shouldn’t do to get away from these tariffs.  The president has made it very clear, again, that he expects every nation around this world to cooperate with the repatriation of their citizens.  And the president has also put out specific statements in terms of Canada and Mexico when it comes to what he expects in terms of border security.\nWe have seen a historic level of cooperation from Mexico.  But, again, as far as I’m still tracking — and that was last night talking to the president directly — February 1st is still on the books.\nQ    Thank you.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Phil.\nQ    Thank you, Karoline.  Quick programming note, and then a question on taxes.\nMS. LEAVITT:  A programming note.\nQ    Well, in terms of programming, should —\nMS. LEAVITT:  That sounds fun.\nQ    — we expect to see you here every day?  How frequently will these —\nQ    That’s a good question.\nQ    — press briefings be?\nMS. LEAVITT:  It is a good question, April.\nSo, look, the president, as you know, is incredibly accessible.  First day here, he wanted all of you in the Oval Office.  You got a 60-minute press conference with the leader of the free world — while he was simultaneously signing executive orders, I may add.  That’s pretty impressive.  I don’t think the previous office holder would be able to pull such a thing off.\nSo, look, the president is the best spokesperson that this White House has, and I can assure you that you will be hearing from both him and me as much as possible.\nQ    And then a question about tax cuts.  You know, the president has promised to extend the tax cuts from the previous term.  I’m curious, you know, does the president support corresponding spending cuts, as some Republicans have called for in Congress?  And will the new Treasury secretary be leading those negotiations with the Hill, as Mnuchin did during the first administration?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The president is committed to both tax cuts and spending cuts.\nAnd he has a great team negotiating on his behalf, but there’s no better negotiator than Donald Trump, and I’m sure he’ll be involved in this reconciliation process as it moves forward.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Karoline, in the announcement that you made last night on the Iron Dome, it said the president had directed that the United States will build this Iron Dome.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah.\nQ    When you read into the executive order, it seemed short of that.  It asked for a series of studies —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah.\nQ    — and reports back on — can you tell us whether the president has directed this and, if he is this concerned on this issue, why the suspensions that we saw listed by OMB included so many different nuclear programs, nonproliferation programs, programs to blend down nuclear weapons, and s- — and so forth?\nMS. LEAVITT:  First of all, when it comes to the Iron Dome, the executive order directed the implementation of the — of an Iron Dome.  It also, as you said, kind of directed research and studies to see if — or — or how the United States can go about doing this, particularly the Department of Defense.\nWhen it comes to the other question that you asked about those specific programs, again, I would say, this is not a — a ban; this is a temporary pause and a freeze to ensure that all of the money going out from Washington, D.C., is in align with the president’s agenda.\nAnd as the Office of Management and Budget has updates on what will be kick-started, once again, I will provide those to you.\nQ    Can you clarify for a sec what you were saying before on Medicaid?  It wasn’t clear to me whether you were saying that no Medicaid would be cut off.  Obviously, a lot of this goes to states before it goes to individuals and so forth.  So, are you guaranteeing here that no individual now on Medicaid would see a cutoff because of the pause?\nMS. LEAVITT:  I’ll check back on that and get back to you.\nJon.\nQ    Thanks a lot, Karoline.  As you know, in the first week that the president was in office, signed an executive order as it relates to birthright citizenship — trying to eliminate that.  Now, 22 state attorney generals have said that this is unconstitutional.  A federal judge has just agreed with their argument.  What’s the administration’s argument for doing away with birthright citizenship?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The folks that you mentioned have a right to have that legal opinion, but it is in disagreement with the legal opinion of this administration.\nThis administration believes that birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, and that is why President Trump signed that executive order.  Illegal immigrants who come to this country and have a child are not subject to the laws of this jurisdiction.  That’s the opinion of this administration.\nWe have already appealed the rul- — the lawsuit that was filed against this administration, and we are prepared to fight this all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to, because President Trump believes that this is a necessary step to secure our nation’s borders and protect our homeland.\nMonica.\nQ    And then on foreign policy — on foreign policy, Karoline —\nQ    Thank you, Karoline.  It’s great to see you, and you’re doing a great —\nQ    — on foreign policy, if I may.  The president’s commitment to the NATO defense Alliance, is it as strong as the prior administration?  Is it the same as when he served as president in his first term in office?\nMS. LEAVITT:  As long as NATO pays their fair share.\nAnd President Trump has called on NATO Allies to increase their defense spending to 5 percent.  You actually saw the head of NATO at Davos last week on Bloomberg Television saying that President Trump is right and if Europe wants to keep itself safe, they should increase their defense spending.\nI would just add that there was no greater ally to our European allies than President Trump in his first term.  The world, for all nations in Europe, and, of course, here at home was much safer because of Presidents Tru- — Trump’s peace through strength diplomatic approach.\nMonica.\nQ    Karoline —\nQ    Thank you.  Thank you, Karoline.  And it’s great to finally be called on as well in the briefing room.  I appreciate that.\nMS. LEAVITT:  You’re welcome.\nQ    Of course, we know President Trump just got back from North Carolina and California meeting with victims of natural disasters.  There’s the two-year anniversary of the East Palestine, Ohio, toxic train derailment.  Does the president have any plans to go visit the victims of that toxic spill or just visit in general?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Not — no plans that I can read out for you here.  If that changes, I will certainly keep you posted.\nWhat I can tell you is that President Trump still talks about his visit to East Palestine, Ohio.  That was one of the turning points, I would say, in the previous election campaign, where Americans were reminded that President Trump is a man of the people.  And he, as a candidate, visited that town that was just derailed by the train derailment — no pun intended — and he offered support and hope, just like I saw the president do this past week.\nIt was a purposeful decision by this president, on his first domestic trip, to go to North Carolina and to California to visit with Americans who were impacted by Hurricane Helene and also by the deadly fires — a red state and a blue state, both of which feel forgotten by the previous administration and the federal government.  That has now — that has now ended under President Trump.\nHe will continue to put Americans first, whether they’re in East Palestine, in Pacific Palisades, or in North Carolina.\n(Cross-talk.)\nSure.\nQ    Thank you, Karoline.  On California, could you please clarify what the military did with the water last night, as referenced in the president’s Truth Social post?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The water has been turned back on in California, and this comes just days after President Trump visited Pacific Palisades and, as you all saw, applied tremendous pressure on state and local officials in Pacific Palisades, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, to turn on the water and to direct that water to places in the south and in the middle of the state that have been incredibly dry, which has led to the expansion — the rapid expansion of these fires.\nQ    So, could you clarify what the military’s role was, where the water came from, and how it got there?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Again, the Army Corps of Engineers has been on the ground in California to respond to the devastation from these wildfires.  And I would point out that just days after President Trump visited the devastation from these fires, the water was turned on.  That is because of the pressure campaign he put on state and local officials there, who clearly lack all common sense.\nAnd I will never forget being at that round table with the president last week and hearing the frustration in the voices of Pacific Palisades residents who feel as though their government has just gone insane.  Before President Trump showed up on the scene, Karen Bass was telling private property owners that they would have to wait 18 months to access their private property.\nSo, this administration, the president and his team that’s on the ground in California — Ric Grenell, who he has designated to oversee this great crisis — ha- — will continue to put pressure on Karen Bass and state and local officials to allow residents to access their properties.\nThis is a huge part of it.  These residents want to take part in their own clearing out of their properties.  They should be able to do that.  It’s the United States of America.  What happened to our freedom?  Clearly, it’s gone in California, but not anymore under President Trump.\nQ    Karoline —\nMS. LEAVITT:  April.\nQ    Karoline, welcome to the briefing room.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Thank you.\nQ    Several questions.  One on the pause.  Will minority-serving institutions, preferably colleges and universities, have those monies held back temporarily at this moment?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Again, I have not seen the entire list, because this memo was just sent out.  So, I will provide you all with updates as we receive them.  Okay?\nQ    Karoline —\nQ    And secondly — als- —\nQ    Karoline.\nQ    Also, secondly, when it comes to immigration, there is this southern border focus.  What happens to those who have overstayed their visas?  That is part of the broken immigration system.  In 2023, there was a report by the Biden administration, the Homeland Security Department, that said overstays of visas were three times more than usual.  Will there be a focus on the overstays for visas as well?\nMS. LEAVITT:  If an individual is overstaying their visa, they are therefore an illegal immigrant residing in this country, and they are subject to deportation.\nQ    And also, lastly —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yes.\nQ    Lastly, as we’re dealing with anti-DEI, anti-woke efforts, we understand this administration could — is thinking about celebrating Black History Month.  Have you got any word on that?  Anything that you can offer to us?\nMS. LEAVITT:  As far as I know, this White House certainly still intends to celebrate, and we will continue to celebrate American history and the contributions that all Americans, regardless of race, religion, or creed, have made to our great country.  And America is back.\nChristian Datoc.\nQ    Thanks, Karoline.  Just real quick.  You mentioned the inflation executive order the president signed, but egg prices have skyrocketed since President Trump took office.  So, what specifically is he doing to lower those costs for Americans?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Really glad you brought this up, because there is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs.  I would like to point out to each and every one of you that, in 2024, when Joe Biden was in the Oval Office — or upstairs in the residence sleeping; I’m not so sure — egg prices increased 65 percent in this country.  We also have seen the cost of everything, not just eggs — bacon, groceries, gasoline — have increased because of the inflationary policies of the last administration.\nAs far as the egg shortage, what’s also contributing to that is that the Biden administration and the Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of more than 100 million chickens, which has led to a lack of chicken supply in this country, therefore a lack of egg supply, which is leading to the shortage.\nSo, I will leave you with this point.  This is an example of why it’s so incredibly important that the Senate moves swiftly to confirm all of President Trump’s nominees, including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins, who is already speaking with Kevin Hassett, who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\nAs for cots, I laid out — costs — I laid out the plethora of ways that President Trump has addressed saving costs for the American people over the past week.  He looks forward to continuing to doing that —\nQ    Karoline, what —\nMS. LEAVITT:  — in the days ahead.\n(Cross-talk.)\nThank you, guys, so much.  I’ll see you soon.\nEND                1:52 P.M. EST\n"

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Policy and Purpose.  Across the country today, medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child’s sex through a series of irreversible medical interventions.  This dangerous trend will be a stain on our Nation’s history, and it must end.\nCountless children soon regret that they have been mutilated and begin to grasp the horrifying tragedy that they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding.  Moreover, these vulnerable youths’ medical bills may rise throughout their lifetimes, as they are often trapped with lifelong medical complications, a losing war with their own bodies, and, tragically, sterilization.\nAccordingly, it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called “transition” of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.\nSec. 2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this order:\n(a)  The term “child” or “children” means an individual or individuals under 19 years of age.\n(b)  The term “pediatric” means relating to the medical care of a child.\n(c)  The phrase “chemical and surgical mutilation” means the use of puberty blockers, including GnRH agonists and other interventions, to delay the onset or progression of normally timed puberty in an individual who does not identify as his or her sex; the use of sex hormones, such as androgen blockers, estrogen, progesterone, or testosterone, to align an individual’s physical appearance with an identity that differs from his or her sex; and surgical procedures that attempt to transform an individual’s physical appearance to align with an identity that differs from his or her sex or that attempt to alter or remove an individual’s sexual organs to minimize or destroy their natural biological functions.  This phrase sometimes is referred to as “gender affirming care.”\nSec. 3.  Ending Reliance on Junk Science.  (a)  The blatant harm done to children by chemical and surgical mutilation cloaks itself in medical necessity, spurred by guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which lacks scientific integrity.  In light of the scientific concerns with the WPATH guidance:\n(i)   agencies shall rescind or amend all policies that rely on WPATH guidance, including WPATH’s “Standards of Care Version 8”; and\n(ii)  within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall publish a review of the existing literature on best practices for promoting the health of children who assert gender dysphoria, rapid-onset gender dysphoria, or other identity-based confusion.\n(b)  The Secretary of HHS, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall use all available methods to increase the quality of data to guide practices for improving the health of minors with gender dysphoria, rapid-onset gender dysphoria, or other identity-based confusion, or who otherwise seek chemical or surgical mutilation.\nSec. 4.  Defunding Chemical and Surgical Mutilation.  The head of each executive department or agency (agency) that provides research or education grants to medical institutions, including medical schools and hospitals, shall, consistent with applicable law and in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving Federal research or education grants end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\nSec. 5.  Additional Directives to the Secretary of HHS.  (a)  The Secretary of HHS shall, consistent with applicable law, take all appropriate actions to end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children, including regulatory and sub-regulatory actions, which may involve the following laws, programs, issues, or documents:\n(i)    Medicare or Medicaid conditions of participation or conditions for coverage;\n(ii)   clinical-abuse or inappropriate-use assessments relevant to State Medicaid programs;\n(iii)  mandatory drug use reviews;\n(iv)   section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;\n(v)    quality, safety, and oversight memoranda;\n(vi)   essential health benefits requirements; and\n(vii)  the Eleventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases and other federally funded manuals, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.\n(b)  The Secretary of HHS shall promptly withdraw HHS’s March 2, 2022, guidance document titled “HHS Notice and Guidance on Gender Affirming Care, Civil Rights and Patient Privacy” and, in consultation with the Attorney General, issue new guidance protecting whistleblowers who take action related to ensuring compliance with this order.\nSec. 6.  TRICARE.  The Department of Defense provides health insurance, through TRICARE, to nearly 2 million individuals under the age of 18.  As appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the Secretary of Defense shall commence a rulemaking or sub-regulatory action to exclude chemical and surgical mutilation of children from TRICARE coverage and amend the TRICARE provider handbook to exclude chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\nSec. 7.  Requirements for Insurance Carriers.  The Director of the Office of Personnel Management, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall:\n(a)  include provisions in the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) and Postal Service Health Benefits (PSHB) programs call letter for the 2026 Plan Year specifying that eligible carriers, including the Foreign Service Benefit Plan, will exclude coverage for pediatric transgender surgeries or hormone treatments; and\n(b)  negotiate to obtain appropriate corresponding reductions in FEHB and PSHB premiums.\nSec. 8.  Directives to the Department of Justice.  The Attorney General shall:\n(a)  review Department of Justice enforcement of section 116 of title 18, United States Code, and prioritize enforcement of protections against female genital mutilation;\n(b) convene States’ Attorneys General and other law enforcement officers to coordinate the enforcement of laws against female genital mutilation across all American States and Territories;\n(c)  prioritize investigations and take appropriate action to end deception of consumers, fraud, and violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by any entity that may be misleading the public about long-term side effects of chemical and surgical mutilation;\n(d)  in consultation with the Congress, work to draft, propose, and promote legislation to enact a private right of action for children and the parents of children whose healthy body parts have been damaged by medical professionals practicing chemical and surgical mutilation, which should include a lengthy statute of limitations; and\n(e)  prioritize investigations and take appropriate action to end child-abusive practices by so-called sanctuary States that facilitate stripping custody from parents who support the healthy development of their own children, including by considering the application of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act and recognized constitutional rights.\nSec. 9.  Enforcing Adequate Progress.  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the heads of agencies with responsibilities under this order shall submit a single, combined report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, detailing progress in implementing this order and a timeline for future action.  The Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall regularly convene the heads of agencies with responsibilities under this order (or their designees) to coordinate and prepare for this submission.\nSec. 10.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstances, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of any of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nSec. 11.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)    the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)   the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 28, 2025."

and\n(ii)  submit to the President through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs a report that summarizes these steps.\n(d)  Absent extraordinary operational necessity, the Armed Forces shall neither allow males to use or share sleeping, changing, or bathing facilities designated for females, nor allow females to use or share sleeping, changing, or bathing facilities designated for males.\n(e)  Within 30 days of the issuance of the respective updates, directives, and guidance under subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, with respect to the Coast Guard, issue updates, directives, and guidance consistent with the updates, directives, and guidance issued under subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section.\nSec. 5.  Implementing the Revocation of Executive Order 14004.  (a)  Pursuant to the Executive Order of January 20, 2025 (Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions), Executive Order 14004 of January 25, 2021 (Enabling All Qualified Americans To Serve Their Country in Uniform), has been revoked.  Accordingly, all policies, directives, and guidance issued pursuant to Executive Order 14004 shall be rescinded to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this order.\n(b)  The Secretary and, with respect to the Coast Guard, the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall take all necessary steps to implement the revocations described in subsection (a) of this section and ensure that all military departments and services fully comply with the provisions of this order.\nSec. 6.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nSec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)    the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)   the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 27, 2025."

    "content": "\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including my authority as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  The threat of attack by ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, and other advanced aerial attacks, remains the most catastrophic threat facing the United States.\nPresident Ronald Reagan endeavored to build an effective defense against nuclear attacks, and while this program resulted in many technological advances, it was canceled before its goal could be realized.  And since the United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 and initiated development of limited homeland missile defense, official United States homeland missile defense policy has remained only to stay ahead of rogue-nation threats and accidental or unauthorized missile launches.\nOver the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the threat from next-generation strategic weapons has become more intense and complex with the development by peer and near-peer adversaries of next-generation delivery systems and their own homeland integrated air and missile defense capabilities.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  To further the goal of peace through strength, it is the policy of the United States that:      (a)  The United States will provide for the common defense of its citizens and the Nation by deploying and maintaining a next-generation missile defense shield;      (b)  The United States will deter — and defend its citizens and critical infrastructure against — any foreign aerial attack on the Homeland; and     (c)  The United States will guarantee its secure second-strike capability. Sec. 3.  Implementation.  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall:      (a)  Submit to the President a reference architecture, capabilities-based requirements, and an implementation plan for the next-generation missile defense shield.  The architecture shall include, at a minimum, plans for: (i)     Defense of the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries; (ii)    Acceleration of the deployment of the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor layer;  (iii)   Development and deployment of proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept;  (iv)    Deployment of underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities postured to defeat a countervalue attack; (v)     Development and deployment of a custody layer of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture;  (vi)    Development and deployment of capabilities to defeat missile attacks prior to launch and in the boost phase; (vii)   Development and deployment of a secure supply chain for all components with next-generation security and resilience features; and(viii)  Development and deployment of non-kinetic capabilities to augment the kinetic defeat of ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks;     (b)  Review relevant authorities and organization of the Department of Defense to develop and deploy capabilities at the necessary speed to implement this directive;     (c)  Jointly with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, submit to the President a plan to fund this directive, allowing sufficient time for consideration by the President before finalization of the Fiscal Year 2026 Budget; and     (d)  In cooperation with United States Strategic Command and United States Northern Command, submit to the President: (i)   An updated assessment of the strategic missile threat to the Homeland; and(ii)  A prioritized set of locations to progressively defend against a countervalue attack by nuclear adversaries.\nSec. 4.  Allied and Theater Missile Defense Review.  The United States continues to cooperate on missile defense with its allies and partners to aid in the defense of ally populations and troops and of forward-deployed United States troops.  Following the submission to the President of the next-generation missile defense reference architecture under section 3(a) of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall direct a review of theater missile defense posture and initiatives to identify ways in which the United States and its allies and partners can:      (a)  Increase bilateral and multilateral cooperation on missile defense technology development, capabilities, and operations;     (b)  Improve theater missile defenses of forward-deployed United States troops and allied territories, troops, and populations; and     (c)  Increase and accelerate the provision of United States missile defense capabilities to allies and partners.\nSec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 27, 2025."

    "content": "Today marks the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the Nazi concentration camp in Poland that stood at the center of the Holocaust and focus for their systematic slaughter of the Jewish people.     Between 1940 and 1945, more than one million Jews, religious leaders, disabled persons, and other innocent victims were viciously and mercilessly executed in Auschwitz at the hands of the evil Nazi regime — culminating in one of the darkest chapters in human history.  On this solemn day, America joins the Jewish community, the people of Poland, and the entire world in mourning the lives lost, the souls battered, the heroes forgotten, and the countless men and women who gave their lives for the cause of freedom.\nOver those 5 gruesome years at Auschwitz, mothers and fathers lost their children, daughters and sons lost their parents, and wives and husbands lost their soulmates to the deadly scourge of anti-Semitism — leaving an unfillable void in their hearts.\nTo those who lost family members and loved ones, we pray that Almighty God will grant you comfort and strength.  To those who survived the atrocities at Auschwitz, we honor your courage, we salute your sacrifice, and we offer you our enduring love and unceasing gratitude.  And to every person touched by the calamities of the Holocaust, we give you our unwavering devotion and eternal promise to never forget the evils that took place during that dark time in history.\nSadly, despite decades of wisdom shared by survivors, years of reflection on the depravities committed, and decades of progress towards peace, the poison of anti-Semitism still courses through the veins of cowards in dark corners of the world.  So today, we renew our promise that anti-Semitism has no place in a civilized society, no place in our foreign policy, and no place in the United States of America.\nIn the years since the liberation of Auschwitz on this day eight decades ago, the grave offenses that took place during the Holocaust and the cries of the Jewish people have echoed throughout the halls of history.  In the wake of the oppression, persecution, and injustice committed at Auschwitz and elsewhere in Europe, the Jewish people gallantly persevered to re-found their homeland in the modern State of Israel — our mighty friend.  To this day, the Jewish people proudly represent the peak of human tenacity and the pinnacle of human triumph.\nAs we commemorate this somber occasion, we pay tribute to the undying spirit of the Jewish community.  We reaffirm our commitment to educating our children and every future generation about the horrors that took place within the confines of Auschwitz and other concentration and death camps.  We renew our resolve to end anti-Semitism and religious bigotry of all forms.  We proudly reassert our strong bonds of friendship with the State of Israel.  And we declare the timeless truth that every human being is a child of God and inherently worthy of dignity and respect.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 27, 2025, as a National Day of Remembrance of the 80th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz.  On this day, I call upon every American citizen to observe this day with programs, ceremonies, and prayers commemorating the victims of the Holocaust and honoring the sacrifices of the men and women who helped liberate the victims of the Nazis at Auschwitz.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand thistwenty-seventh day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth."

He stated in his 2024 reelection campaign that “…[y]ou can’t have a woke military…You need people that want to win. They want to win wars. That’s what their purpose is, to win wars, not to be woke… but we do have great military.”"

    "content": "ENFORCING THE HYDE AMENDMENT: On Friday, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to end the use of Federal taxpayer dollars to fund or promote elective abortion.\n- The Order recognizes that, for nearly five decades, Congress has enacted the Hyde Amendment and a series of additional laws to protect taxpayers from being forced to pay for abortion. Contrary to this longstanding commonsense policy, the previous administration embedded federal funding of elective abortion in a wide variety of government programs.\n- To restore this longstanding policy, the Order rescinds two executive orders from President Biden that violate the Hyde Amendment:Executive Order 14076 imposed a whole-of-government effort to promote and fund abortion and to politicize enforcement of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act.Federal statutes protecting access to emergency medical care for pregnant women under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) and protecting personal health information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) remain in full effect.\n\nExecutive Order 14079 recategorized abortion as “healthcare” in order to provide taxpayer funding for elective abortions. This included using Medicaid funding to pay for travel costs for elective abortions.\n- Executive Order 14076 imposed a whole-of-government effort to promote and fund abortion and to politicize enforcement of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act.Federal statutes protecting access to emergency medical care for pregnant women under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) and protecting personal health information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) remain in full effect.\n- Federal statutes protecting access to emergency medical care for pregnant women under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) and protecting personal health information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) remain in full effect.\n- Executive Order 14079 recategorized abortion as “healthcare” in order to provide taxpayer funding for elective abortions. This included using Medicaid funding to pay for travel costs for elective abortions.\nENDING FEDERAL FUNDING OF ABORTION OVERSEAS: President Donald J. Trump also signed a Presidential Memorandum reinstating the Mexico City Policy to stop the use of federal taxpayer dollars for abortion overseas.\n- The President’s policy from 2017 is reinstated to ensure that no U.S. taxpayer money supports foreign organizations that perform or actively promote abortion in other nations.\n- The first Trump Administration also extended this policy to global health assistance. A 2020 report by the United States Agency for International Development found that this life-affirming policy in no way diminished women’s health around the world.\nPROTECTING TAXPAYERS FROM FUNDING ABORTION: For the first time in nearly fifty years, President Trump returned the issue of life to a vote of the people, from within the States.\n- Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, 597 U.S. 215 (2022), overturned Roe v. Wade and returned the power to regulate issues of life and safety to the people. Three of the justices deciding the case were appointed by President Trump.\n- Federal overreach and taxpayer dollars will no longer force violations of faith and conscience or impede the ability of states to determine life policies through a vote of the people.\n\nFor example, under President Biden, the Department of Defense reimbursed abortion-related travel expenses, the Department of Veterans Affairs allowed hospitals to provide abortions, and the Department of Health and Human Services paid for abortions for illegal immigrants.\n- For example, under President Biden, the Department of Defense reimbursed abortion-related travel expenses, the Department of Veterans Affairs allowed hospitals to provide abortions, and the Department of Health and Human Services paid for abortions for illegal immigrants.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED AND DELIVERED: President Trump promised to protect and defend a vote of the people, from within the states, on the issue of life. Today’s executive actions build on the long list of accomplishments from the first Trump Administration to support the sanctity of every human life and prevent taxpayer funding of abortion. Select highlights of the first Trump Administration’s work include:\n- Reinstated and expanded the Mexico City Policy, ensuring that taxpayer money is not used to fund abortion globally.\n- Issued a rule preventing Title X taxpayer funding from subsiding the abortion industry.\n- Cut all funding to the United Nations Population Fund, which supports coercive abortion and forced sterilization.\n- Signed legislation overturning the previous administration’s regulation that prohibited states from defunding abortion facilities as part of their family planning programs.\n- Fully enforced the separate payment requirement for abortion coverage in Obamacare exchange plans.\n- Stopped the Federal funding of fetal tissue research.\n- Worked to protect healthcare entities and individuals’ conscience rights, ensuring that no medical professional is forced to participate in an abortion in violation of their beliefs.\n- Issued an executive order reinforcing the requirement that all hospitals in the United States provide medical treatment or an emergency transfer for infants who are in need of emergency medical care—regardless of prematurity or disability.\n- Led a coalition of countries to sign the Geneva Consensus Declaration, declaring that there is no international right to abortion and committing to protecting women’s health.\n- First president in history to attend the March for Life."

complete.  I guess one day is left, if you think about it.  We’re heading to Florida.  We’re going to be at Doral because I’m making a speech there the following day for a group — a very important group.  And then, I guess we come back to Washington.\nSo, we’re heading, as you know, to Miami — Doral.\nOkay.  Any questions?\nQ    Are you going to get a round of golf in?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I don’t think so.  It’s so busy.\nQ    What’s your favorite part on the plane, Mr. President?  What do you like — you know?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Which plane?\nQ    Like, this one.  Air Force One.  When you were back, what did you like —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  The plane?  No, I’ve been on the plane many, many times, as you know.  It’s a great plane.  It’s a special plane.\nQ    Do you still want to change the colors?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Who?\nQ    Do you still want to change the colors — the exterior?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I would change them.  Sure.  It’d be a much more appropriate plane, rather than the baby blue.  We want power blue, not baby blue.\nBut no, you know, this is nice, but everything has its time and place.  We’ll be changing the colors.\nQ    Can you talk to us about the firing of the inspectors general?  Why did you do that?  And is it the —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Because it’s a very common thing to do.  And not all of them.  Michael Horowitz, we’re keeping.  I thought his report on Comey was incredible, actually.  It was such an accurate, well-done report.  I only wish Bill Barr used it, which he chose not to.  But it was — it was an incredible report.  Michael Horowitz wrote the definitive report on James Comey and the FBI.  It really got that going.\nAnd I understand.  I don’t know them, but some people thought that some were unfair or some were not doing the job.  And it’s a very standard thing to do, very much like the U.S. attorneys.\nQ    Do you plan to bring your own people in those positions, Mr. President?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Which people?\nQ    The — in the — in the inspectors general role?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s not my people.  They’re not my people.  I don’t know anybody that would do that, but we’ll put people in there that will be very good.\nQ    Mr. President, there’s reports that Elon Musk now must go through Susie Wiles and that he doesn’t have an office in the West Wing.  I’m curious if — how you feel about that.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no, not — it’s not Elon’s office.  We have an office that’s set up for purposes of — when I do an executive order, that the order is carried out, not that it sits around for three months.  And we’ll have about 20 people, maybe more, working out of that office.  It’s really an office for a lot of people that go and make sure that the executive office —\nYou know, when I do an executive document, very important executive do- — I want to make sure that that is done.  And there’s about 20 or 25 people that will be working out of that office, and it’s really a “go get ‘em” office to make sure it gets done.  That’s what that is.\nQ    So, you’re a week in now to your presidency.  How does it compare to your first week in 2017?  Did you learn any lessons or are you trying to do something differently?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I come in now with great knowledge and experience and you could say that no — if you call it “new president” has ever had this kind of experience, that’s for sure.  Whereas before, I had never done it before, but we did well.\nWe had a very — we had a great presidency, but this one could be really outstanding.  I think you’re seeing the same reports that I see.  And you write the reports.  Most of you are writing the important reports.  We’re getting A-pluses on the work done and also the amount of work done.  I mean, nobody else has done this.\nYou go to North Carolina.  Then you go to Los Angeles.  And then you stop on the way home and — and that was “no tax on tips,” but it was really a stop to thank the people of Nevada for having been — you know, it’s a very hard state to win as a — as a Republican, and we won it very conclusively.  So, it was really more of a thank you to the people of Nevada.  So, I stopped there.  And I have a lot of meetings once I get back, once I get to Miami.\nBut no, it’s — I think we had — people are saying it was the most successful first week that anybody can remember a president having.\nQ    Mr. President, you were so nice to Governor Newsom yesterday.  No “News-” — you know, “Governor Newscum.”  What was that about?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I decided to be nice.  It was nice that he came to the plane, honestly.  You know, I didn’t know he’d be at the plane.  It was nice that he came to the plane.\nAnd in the end, you know, we have the same goal.  We want to make — take that catastrophe and make it as good as possible.\nWe disagree in some things.  I guess he’s not so set on water, and I like water for putting out fires.  I find it to be extremely good.  Very — a little old fashioned, but about the best thing that God has ever created for putting out fires.\nAnd so, we’re going to be doing something on that.  But no, I get along — I actually always got along with him well until fairly recently.\nQ    If I could ask you about the first lady —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And I very much — you know, I very much predicted that was going to happen.  Because if you go back, like, six years, I said, “If you don’t start getting this place taken care of and mitigating some of the problems that are here, you’re going to end up with a fire like you had ever seen.”  I turned out to be right.\nQ    If I could ask you about the first lady.  She seems to be taking a more public-facing role.  I just wonder how you envision her spending the next four years.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think she was always very much involved, but you didn’t see her — more behind the scenes.  But she was always a “front of the scenes” person, and I think she really wanted — she felt badly about North Carolina, and she felt very badly about California.  Los Angeles — got a lot of friends.  I have a lot of friends in North Carolina and — and both.  And she has a lot of friends in California.\nSo, she wanted to be with me for that.  Yeah.  For both of them.\nQ    Mr. President, is your preference for Larry Ellison to work to obtain TikTok?  Or do you have any preference on how this deal is going?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t spoken — Larry is a friend of mine.  Lives in — you know, right in — near Mar-a-Lago, right down the road.  I never spoke to Larry about TikTok.\nQ    But there is —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’ve spoken to many people about TikTok, and there’s great interest in TikTok.  And as you know, I have the right to sell it or close it, depending on what I think is best for the country.\nSo, we’ll make a decision over the next 90 days or so.\nQ    There is a report, Mr. President, that says that you are putting together a deal with Oracle and outside investors to help them buy TikTok and save TikTok.  Is that happening?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, not with Oracle.  With — numerous people are talking to me — very substantial people — about buying it.  And I’d make that decision over the next — probably over the next 30 days.\nI have 90 days.  Congress has given 90 days, and we’ll see.  If we could save TikTok, I think it would be a good thing.\nSo, we’ll make a decision.  We have a lot of interest in it.  And the United States will be a big beneficiary if we do it.  I’d only do it if the United States benefits.\nI mean, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won on TikTok — and I ended up winning by a lot — young people.  And as you know, Republicans historically — I don’t think — ever won young people, and I won them by a lot.  So, I do have a little bit of a warm spot.\nBut, you know, it’s a very popular site, and the kids are loving it, and some of the parents are loving it.  And if we can save it, I think that would be a very good thing.  And I think it would be economically good for America.\nQ    Mr. President, could I ask you about Ukraine?  Do you have any update on when you are going to talk to Russian president Vad- — Russian President Putin?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He wants to speak, and we’ll be speaking soon.  And I’ve spoken to President Zelenskyy numerous times, and they’d like to see peace.  They would like to see an end to the war.  And I think President Putin would like to see an end to the war too.  So, we’ll see if we can help it along.\nQ    On the —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think it’s a shame.  It’s a war that would have never happened if I were president.  It’s a shame.\nQ    We’ve seen a lot of people being fired from the federal government.  What’s the sort of criterion you’re using for this?  Is it loyalty to you?  And can we expect more of these purges?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You have to show up to work, basically.  You have to show up to work.  You have to go to your office, and you have to work.  And otherwise, you’re not going to have a job.\nQ    Do you worry that that limits the pool of talent?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I think the talent is deep.  We have very deep talent.  But we also have a lot of excess people.  You know, this was just a — this was a gimmick for Democrats, to a certain extent.  But we have a lot of excess people, but the talent is very deep.\nQ    Now that you’ve done your first domestic trip, have you given any thought to where you want to go for your first international trip?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, it could be Saudi Arabia.  It could be UK.  Traditionally, it’s been UK.\nLast time, I went to Saudi Arabia because they agreed to buy 450 billion dollars’ worth of United States merchandise, including a lot of military equipment and farm equipment and other equipment.  And if that offer were right, I’d do that again.\nQ    If you go to the UK, do you think you’ll get along with Keir Starmer and the Labor government?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I do.  I mean, I’ve met him already three times.  He’s come over to see me twice.  I have a call — he and I have a call over the next 24 hours.\nNo, I get along with him well.  I like him a lot.  He’s liberal, which is a little bit different for me.  But I think he’s a very good person.  I think he’s — he’s done a very good job thus far.  He’s very new on the job, but he’s represented his country in terms of his philosophy.  I may not agree with his philosophy, but I have a very good relationship with him.\nI’ve seen him twice.  Had dinner with him at Trump Tower, as you probably know.  You know that, right?\nQ    Just on Saudi, Mr. President.  You spoke to the crown prince.  Did you discuss a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I discussed getting oil prices down. Because if you get oil prices down, Russia will stop the war, and Biden should have never allowed them to go up so high.\nWhen Biden let them go up to that level, he was just inducing Russia, which sells oil, to go into a war.  So, he should have never allowed — the Democrats, namely Biden, allowed oil prices to go up.  That’s one of the reasons that you have the Ukraine catastrophe.\nQ    How do you bring the prices down?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Volume.  Yeah.\nQ    (Inaudible) increasing production.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    Can you tell us about your call with the king of Jordan today, please?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It was a very good call.  He’s a friend of mine.  I know him very well.  I’ve gotten along with him over the years very well, and he’s done a wonderful job.\nHe really houses, you know, millions of Palestinians, and he does it in a very humane way.  And I compliment him on that.  But he really — Jordan has done an amazing job of housing largely Palestin- — Palestinians.  And he’s done it in a very successful way.\nQ    So, what was the subject of discussion?  Was it — was it —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It was that.  I said to him, “I’d love you to take on more.”  Because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it’s a mess.  It’s a real mess.\nQ    So, you’d like Jordan to house people from Gaza?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You have to take people.  I’d like Egypt to take people.  I’m meeting with — I’m talking to General el-Sisi tomorrow — sometime, I believe.  And I’d like Egypt to take people, and I’d like Jordan to take people.\nI can — I mean, you’re talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing.  It’s — you know, it’s — over the centuries, that’s — that’s many, many conflicts, that site.\nAnd I don’t know.  It’s something has to happen, but it’s literally a demolition site right now.  Almost everything is demolished, and people are dying there.  So, I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing at a different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change.\nQ    Temporary?  Or would they — would they ever go back?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It could be either.  It could be temporarily, could be long term.\nQ    Go ahead.\nQ    You’ve spoken about artificial intelligence quite a bit this week.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    Do you have any concerns about the risks to — to humanity about artificial superintelligence?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, artificial intelligence is the — it’s where all of the smart countries want to be going.  Great for coming up with cures to disease, great with coming up with everything, but there are always risks.\nAnd it’s the first question I ask: How do you absolve yourself from (inaudible), et cetera?  Because it could be the rabbit that gets away.  We’re not going to let that happen.\nBut it’s going to be the biggest field — maybe the biggest field in the world, and we’re going to be equipped to take it.  And we’re already leading.  I mean, we’re going to be leading.  Very shortly, we’re going to be leading by a lot.\nWhat they do need is tremendous energy.  They need electricity at levels that nobody has ever seen before, and we’ll be able to supply that electric.  I’m going to use —\nQ    The Pentagon —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’ll be using emergency power to give that electric.\nQ    The Pentagon, Mr. President, just lifted a hold on 2,000-pound bombs for Israel, which was blocked by Biden.  Can you — do you have a comment on that, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  On the what?\nQ    On the 2,000-pound bombs —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh.\nQ    — that Biden had put a hold on.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We released them.\nQ    Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We released them today, and they’ll have them, and they paid for them, and, you know, they’ve been waiting for them for a long time.  They’ve been in storage for a long time.\nBut we released them today to Israel.\nQ    Why did you do that, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Because they bought them.\nQ    There are reports, Mr. President, that you spoke to the Danish prime minister and she told you Greenland is not for sale.  Will you take no for an answer on that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Who are you with?\nQ    CNN.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh.\nQ    (Laughs.)  Your favorite.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, they’re terrible.  Honestly, that’s why they’re going out of business.  It’s terrible.  Or they’ll be bought cheap.  Maybe some rich guy will buy them cheap.  But anyway, it’s just the tone of your question every time.\nI think Greenland will be worked out with us.  I think we’re going to have it.  And I think the people want to be with us, as you know.  There’s 55,000 people there.  They want to be with us.\nI don’t know, really, what claim Denmark has to it, but it would be a very unfriendly act if they didn’t allow that to happen.  Because that’s for protection of the free world.  It’s not for us; it’s for the free world.\nRight now, you have Russian ships.  You have China ships.  You have ships from various countries.  It’s not a good situation.\nAnd I believe we’ll get that.  Yeah, I do believe it.  I think we’ll get other things too that you’re talking about, that nobody knows.  But I think we’ll get other — other things.\nBut I do believe Greenland we’ll get, because it really has to do with freedom of the world, not just freedom of — it has nothing to do with the United States, other than we’re the one that can provide the freedom.  They can’t.  They can’t.\nI mean, they put two dog sleds there two weeks ago.  They thought that was protection.\nQ    But the other thing is Canada —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And you know what?  The people don’t like the way they’ve been treated by Denmark.  They don’t like the way they’ve been treated by Denmark.  And they do like us.\nQ    Mr. President, on the Senate confirmations, Senat- — or Vice President JD Vance had to come and — to pass the tiebreaking vote.  I’m curious if you’re concerned at all about any of the other nominees.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No.  Whatever it is, it is.  I think they’re doing well.  I think we just had a big — a big win today, as you know.  Kristi Noem, I think, will be outstanding at Homeland.\nAnd we have some other ones going.  And no, I don’t — you know, I don’t see any major problems.\nQ    The U.S. — the U.S. has suspended most foreign aid, including PEPFAR, which is a program that’s credited with saving millions of lives in Africa.  Is there a timeline for opening up U.S. aid?  Is there a review —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’ll see — we’ll see about that.  But we want other people to join us, because we’re like a one-way street.  So, we want other people to help us, and we want other people to join us.\nWe’re spending billions and billions and billions of dollars, and other countries that are wealthy are spending zero. And we want them to help.  Why should we be the only one?  So, they understand that.  They’ve been told that.\nIt’s a little like NATO.  I mean, we were spending — we were almost paying for all of NATO.  And yet, they were taking advantage of us on trade.  Similar countries.  The same and similar countries.\nAnd after I got involved, they were paying a lot of money on NATO.  The Secretary General was very generous in his statements about me with respect to NATO.\nSo, we’ll see.  I think NATO should be more too, though.  I think it should be more than the two.  It should be — should be five, actually.\nQ    The CIA, Mr. President, prefers to — prefers the lab leak theory to explain COVID’s origins now.  I was curious to hear your thoughts on that.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, you have a good man there.  A very good man.  And John is — he’s just gotten approved, as you know.  John Ratcliffe also got approved.  And I’d rather have you ask him that question.\nHe’ll be — he knows everything about it right now.\nQ    Have you had a chance — have you given any thought to the future of the air base at Diego Garcia, which, as you know, is part of the Chagos Islands, which Britain is returning to the Mauritius islands.  There are concerns that could open it up to spying by Iran or China.  Do you have —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I mean, it hasn’t been number one on my list, I’ll be honest with you.  That was not number one.\nQ    (Inaudible) you didn’t talk about Canada, about the Panama Canal.  You mentioned today expansion —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think Canada has been treating us very unfairly on trade, and they’ve taken advantage of us for years, and we’re not going to allow that to happen.\nI love Canada.  I have so many friends up in Canada, and they like us and they like me.  But Canada has been taking advantage of the United States for years, and we’re not going to let that happen.\nAnd without our subsidy, Canada, you know, doesn’t exist really.  It’s very — it’s — Canada is totally reliant on us, therefore they should be a state.  Canada — we lose $250 billion a year on Canada.  I could stop that in one day.  And if I stopped that, Canada wouldn’t exist as a state, you know, as a — as a country.\nAnd I think if that’s going to — if we’re going to have to give that kind of subsidy — and we’re not even talking about tariffs yet, but that’ll happen on February 1st.\nBut if we’re going to lose $250 billion for the sake of supporting a country, it’s not fair to us.  And they do about almost 90 percent of their business with the United States, whereas with us, it’s the opposite.  It’s, you know, relatively small.\nSo, I don’t want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on supporting a country unless that country is a state.  And if it is a state, the people of Canada would pay a much lower tax.  You know, their taxes would be cut in half.  They would have no military problems.  They’d be much more secure in every way.\nAnd I think it’s a great thing for Canada.  And I view it as, you know, honestly, a country that should be a state, and they’ll get much better treatment, much better care, and much lower taxes, and they’ll be much more secure.\nThank you very much, everybody.\nQ    Thank you for coming back.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nEND                 3:27 P.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Ah, hello, Las Vegas.  Hello, Las Vegas.\nHello, Nevada.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.\nAUDIENCE:  Trump!  Trump!  Trump!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we won.  We won.  We won.  (Applause.)\nAnd it’s great to be back in this beautiful city to celebrate the historic first week in the White House.  That was definitely a start.  (Applause.)  And I had a lot of help in winning.\nJoe Lombardo, your governor, is here someplace.  Where’s Joe?  (Applause.)  Thank you, Joe.  You’re looking good, Joe.  Thank you very much.  What a group.  Look at who you have next you.  How can you fail with that guy?  (Applause.)\nAlso, Lieutenant Governor Stavros.  Anthony Stavros, thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Where are you?  There you are, Stavros.  You’re very good.\nIs he doing a good job, Joe?  I think so, huh?  He’s all right, huh?  (Laughter.)\nNevada GOP Chair Michael McDonald, he — (applause) — he did something which not a lot of people have been able to do, but I think Republicans are going to start winning this state.  You know, typically, they don’t necessarily do so good.  We did really well.  (Applause.)  We won in a landslide.  That’s really why I’m here, I must be honest with you.\nRepublican National Committeewoman Sigal Chattah.  (Applause.)  Sigal, thank you, wherever you may be.  Hi, Sigal.  Thank you very much.\nRepublican National Committeeman Jim DeGraffenreid.  (Applause.)  That’s a hell of a beautiful name.  But I know the name so long, it’s easy to say.\nOne of the greatest people, I’ll tell you — a man who’s done so damn well.  I don’t know what it is with him.  He’s just a legend.  He’s one person — you know, we can all sort of be replaced, although we don’t like to think that — maybe it’s not true — but this is a guy that can’t be replaced.  There’s nobody like him: Dana White.  (Applause.)  Where’s Dana White?  Where is Dana White?  Where the hell is he?  UFC.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  Nelk Boys!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s great. Are the Nelk Boys here?  Oh, yeah.  There they are, the Nelk Boys.  Right there.  (Applause.)  (Laughs.)\nAnd Rick Harrison.  Rick, thank you very much for being here.  (Applause.)  You’re around here someplace with Dana.\nMr. Phil Ruffin; his wife, Oleksandra; and their two beautiful children, Richard and Malena.  (Applause.)  Phil?  Where’s Ruffin?  Where is Phil Ruffin?  He’s right here.  Say, he’s some legend, I’ll tell you.  He’s a legend in Las Vegas and beyond.  Phil.  He’s here.  He’ll be coming out.\nToday, we talk about how we’re going to end the economic suffering and stagnation and disaster of the past four years and create the four greatest years in the history of our country.  That’s what’s going to happen.  (Applause.)  That’s what’s going to happen.\nAnd as I said in my Inaugural Address which, by the way, it got the highest rating in the history of Fox.  (Applause.)  Can you believe that?  That’s nice — “the golden age of America begins right now.”  (Applause.)\nBut I have to be honest with you, I’m really here for a different reason.  I’m here to say thank you.  (Applause.)\nI went to North Carolina yesterday, and then I flew to see just an unbelievable problem in — just a mess in Los Angeles, right?  And I said, “You know what I ought to do?  I want to come to a state known as ‘Nevada.’”  Has anyone ever heard of it?  (Applause.)  And don’t ever mispronounce the name.  You’re not allowed to do that, Chair.  You mispronounce the name; you’re going have a problem.  (Laughter.)\nYou ever see somebody when they say it’s “Nev-ah-da”?\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT: “Nev-ah-da”?  No, they’re in deep — they’re in deep trouble.\nI want to come to Nevada to pay my respects, because this is the only Republican win of this state in decades, and it was a very big landslide, so — (applause).  But I think Republicans are going to win a lot now.\nBut it was a big — we had a big win, and it was an early win.  And that was a bad signal for the Democrats; they heard that we were leading so big here.\nAnd Joe helped us so much, and a lot of people in this room helped us a lot.  Special group.  Special group.\nAnd so, I said, “You know what I’ll do?  We’re going to fly around it.”  And I said, “Let’s fly right over it.  Let’s land, and I’ll do something.  And I’ll just say it.” But I want to say it, and I’m almost saying it right here for the media.  I just came here because I wanted to thank the people of Nevada for giving us such a big win.  (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\nAUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  A lot of great friends.  I better not introduce them all, I’ll be here all day.\nUnder our leadership, we’re going to defeat inflation, bring down prices, we’re going to raise those wages.  They’re going to go up.  (Applause.)  They’re going to go up.  Put more money in your pocket, secure our borders, restore law and order to our cities, and we’re going to make America great again.  (Applause.)\nAnd for four long years, the last administration waged war on the American middle class and everybody else.  They had a lot of wars.  We had no wars when I left.  You know, we defeated ISIS, and we stayed out.  Nobody wanted to mess with us.  They had a lot of wars.  We’re still — we’re trying to put them out.  We’ll get them put out.  Don’t worry, we’ll get them put out.\nWe were — we were headed to World War III.  I’m telling you; we would have had problems like you wouldn’t believe.\nThey shut down American energy; buried you in crippling regulation; imposed hidden taxes; and spent trillions and trillions of dollars on waste, corruption, and radical left lunacy.  These were lunatics.\nThe result was the most brutal inflation in a half a century — perhaps ever in this country — I think ever — and soaring prices for food, groceries, and other household goods.\nThe people of Nevada are now paying nearly $1,200 per month more to make ends meet since I left office.  Think of that: $1,200, at least.\nBut since I became the 47th president at noon on Monday, I’ve been moving with urgency and historic speed — (applause) — to fix every single calamity of the Biden administration that they’ve created.\nAnd this week alone, I took nearly 350 executive actions to reverse — (applause) — the horrible failures and betrayals that we inherited from a group of people that didn’t know what the hell they were doing.  (Laughter.)  What they’ve done to the — what they’ve done to this country, especially the open borders, where they have — think of it — 21 million people came in.  Many of them are criminals, murderers.\nWell, we’re getting them out.  You see it.  You see it yesterday — first day.  (Applause.)\nOur message could not be clearer: America’s decline is over.  American decline is over.\nWe’re laughed at all over the world.  Now we’re not laughed at anymore, I’ll tell you.\nWhat the world witnessed this week is nothing less than a revolution of wealth creation for everyone and also common sense.  It’s about common sense.  It really is.  We’re the party of common sense.  (Applause.)\nOn day one, I directed every member of my Cabinet to — and, by the way, Pete Hegseth got approved.  (Applause.)\nAnd Kristi Noem just got approved.  Governor, she’s going it — (applause).  She’s tough.  She’s a tough one.  She’s a tough one, and she’s going to do a great job.\nOn day one, I directed every member of my Cabinet to marshal all powers at their disposal to defeat inflation and bring down the cost of daily life.  We want to bring prices down.  Too high.  They went way up.  They didn’t come down.\nI imposed a federal hiring freeze, a federal regulation freeze, a foreign aid freeze.  Oh, that’s a nice one.  (Applause.)\nAnd I created the new Department of Government Efficiency.  And we’re going to have a lot of good people — Elon.  We’re going to get Elon Musk to get involved in that a little bit.  (Applause.)  He already is.  People like him.\nI terminated the ridiculous and incredibly wasteful Green New Scam.  (Applause.)  Wasn’t the environment supposed to eat us up, like, in 12 years?  But that was, like, 13 years ago.  What happened?  We’re still here.  We’re still here.  Remember, “We have 12 years to live.”  Remember that?  Done by somebody that never even took a course on the environment.\nAOC plus three.  Do you remember those three?  They were telling us about the environment.  AOC plus three.\nThis action alone will save hundreds of billions of dollars of American taxpayers’ money.\nI withdrew from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord.  (Applause.)\nAnd I canceled the insane and costly electric vehicle mandate — (applause) — keeping my sacred pledge to America’s autoworkers.  Boy, did we get a big vote with the autoworkers, I’ll tell you — and the Teamsters.  Any Teamster in the room?  (Applause.)  We got a tremendous vote from the Teamsters.  Thank you.  (Laughs.)  Pointing like — one — one guy, all there is.  (Laughter.)  But they voted for us in the millions.  We had a lot of Teamsters voting for us.\nI withdrew from the World Health Organization — (applause) — where we paid $500 million a year and China paid $39 million a year, despite a much larger population.  Think of that: China is paying $39 million.  They have 1.4 billion people.  We pay $500 million.  We have — nobody knows what the hell we have.  Does anyone know?  (Laughter.)  We have so many people pouring in, we have no idea.\nWe go up, but we’re going down a little bit now.  You don’t mind that, do you?  (Applause.)  Going to take some bad ones out.\nI would do it four years ago, but Biden immediately went back for even more money.  I mean, he went back and — you know, they offered me at $39 million.  They said, “We’ll let you back in at $39.  So, we’re going to reduce it from $500 to $39.”  I turned them down, because it became so popular.  I didn’t know if it would be well received, even at $39.\nBut maybe we would consider doing it again.  I don’t know.  Maybe we would.  They have to clean it up a little bit.\nBut China pays $39 million for 1.4 billion, and we’re paying $500 million for 325 million.  I don’t know what the hell is wrong with these people. (Laughter.)\nAnd then when Biden went back in — you know, they immediately went back in — they paid more than we were paying in the first place.  They paid more than the $500 million.  So, they knew they could have had it for $39.  They paid more.\nYou wouldn’t do that, Joe, right?  No, think of it.  They know they have a deal at $39, so they went back in at $525 million.  What the hell?  Man, oh, man.  It just infuriates you, doesn’t it?\nI declared a national energy emergency to unlock the liquid gold under our feet — (applause) — and pave the way for rapid approvals of the new energy infrastructure.  (Applause.)\nThe United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth.  We may be a very substantially enlarged country in the not too distant– isn’t it nice to see?\nYou know, for years, for decades, we’re the same size to the square foot — probably got smaller, actually — but we might be an enlarged country pretty soon.\nAnd one of the things we’re going to be doing is drill, baby —\nAUDIENCE:  Drill!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — drill.  (Applause.)  Because that’s going to bring everything down.  It’s going to bring everything down.\nMy administration has also begun the largest deregulation campaign in the history of our country, far exceeding I had the record four year — we ran — we had a great economy — the greatest economy that we’ve ever had — four years ago.  But this is going to be better.  You watch, this will be better even than the first term.  (Applause.)\nAnd the reason I got elected was because of the first term.  You know, somebody said, “What was the reason you got elected?  I mean, you won by so much.”  I said, “My first term.”  (Applause.)  You know.  It’s all I did.  I just said, “Well, take a look at the numbers.  Take a look at the numbers.”\nIn total, the Biden administration imposed $50,000 in additional regulation costs on the average American.  And think of this: The average American was paying much more than $50,000.  And, you know, just think of it.  Nobody can even believe the numbers.\nI promise to eliminate 10 old regulations for every new regulation.  So, if we put in a regulation — (applause) — we have to get rid of 10.  That’s what I did.  I did it — I did it one in seven.  We’re going to do 1 in 10 this time, which will soon put many thousands of dollars back into your pockets, in the pockets of American families.\nAs a result of the reforms, we’ve just begun to implement economic confidence, and it’s soaring.\nSo, this week, Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank announced Stargate, a $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure — which is going to be very big for Nevada, I have to tell you, the largest in history, and which will create an estimated 100,000 American jobs.  (Applause.)\nSaudi Arabia just said that they’re going to invest at least $600 billion.  This is because of the election, by the way.  (Applause.)  And I believe they’ll make it a trillion.  I’m going to ask them to make it $1 trillion.  What the hell, the money means nothing to them.\nYou know, where they made their money?  From liquid gold, right?  They got a lot of liquid gold.  We have more.  We have more than Saudi Arabia.  They’ve got a lot.  We’ve got more.  We’ve got more than anybody.  We just don’t use it because of the environment.  These people are crazy.  (Laughter.)\nAnd many other companies, likewise, are looking to invest, but I don’t have enough time to do that, and we have a lot of news conferences.  Everybody wants to have a news conference.  You know, they’re calling up by the hundreds, “We want to have a news conference.  We’re going to invest $12.”  (Laughter.)  I said, “No, I don’t do that.”  I said, “It’s got to be $1 billion or more for a news conference.”  (Laughter and applause.)  It’s $1 billion or more.\nJust two days ago, because of our tariff plans, Stellantis announced — that’s a very good automobile company — the revival of its Belvidere, Illinois, plant, saving 1,500 American auto jobs that were previously headed to Canada — (applause) — along with major investments to expand American auto production in Detroit, Michigan; Toledo, Ohio; and Kokomo, Indiana.  Good place.\nAll of these investments are happening only because of our historic victory.  And if we didn’t win, it’d be just the opposite.  They’re pulling out.  They were pulling out.  They were really pulling out.  So, they would be withdrawing money.\nOur country was on the verge of some of the very bad things, and bad things were happening.  And now there’s light, not only over America — I’ve heard it from even our enemies.  They call up and they say, “Sir, we hate you.  We do hate you, but there’s light over the world right now.”  (Laughter.)  They hate me.  Some of them hate me.  If they liked me, you got a problem, right?  They liked Sleepy Joe.  What’s not to like?\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You know, they’d call up — it’s funny.  I was told today by one of the big leaders of the world — would call for a telephone call with the president of the United States a year ago, and they’d say, “We’d like to speak with….”  “Who is this?”  “It’s the head of Germany, the head of — it’s” — name it — “the head of France.”  The name of any country; it didn’t matter.  He would never pick up the call.  They’d say, “He’ll call you back in two months.”  (Laughter.)  “Two months?”\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  He’s sleeping!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  “Yeah, it’s his schedule.  He’s extremely busy” — (laughs) — sleeping — no, it — (laughter) —\nMacron of France, “He’ll call you back in two months.”  So, two months comes along, and there’s no call.  They’d say —\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — “He didn’t call.”  (Laughs.)  He’s — (laughter) —\nThe stories are — I mean, these stories are not very exaggerated.  I want to tell you, they’re a little bit for laughter, but, you know, it’s only for laughter.\nThe fake news will say, “Oh, he exaggerated.  It was only one month.”  You know?  (Laughter.)\nBut they would say, “He’ll call you back.”  And then he’d never call, and then they could never get him on the phone.\nAnd the problem I have is that when I speak to the — and I speak to them immediately — they’ll say, “Could we speak to the president?  Would that be possible?  We can do it any time over the next month.”  They’re so used to this, right?  I say, “No, I’ll pick it up right now.  Is he on the other phone?”  “Yeah.”  “Hello.  How you doing?”  (Laughter.)  That’s what — you know, get it — get it over with, right?  (Applause.)  Get it over with.\nThe only problem: They were so starved for love from the United States, I cannot get them off the phone.  (Laughter.)  I can’t get people — if you can’t, I say, “I have to go now, King,” or “I have to go now, President.”  (Laughter.)  But you can’t get them off the phone.  They’re starved for love.  You know, for years, they haven’t spoken.  (Laughter.)  They didn’t even know we had a president, if you want to know.  (Laughter.)\nBut under our leadership, America is back, open for business, and it’s really a big deal.  (Applause.)  It’s really a big —\nAnd they have, though.  They said, you know, there’s like a light all over the world now.  It’s not just here.  We feel the light over our country.  Everyone does.  But there’s a light all over the world.\nWe’ve accomplished more in one week that other administrations have accomplished in four years, and we’re just getting started.  (Applause.)\nWe got rid of the woke.  We got rid of the woke crap.  What a lot — (applause) — what a lot of stuff.  What a lot of crap that was.  (Laughter.)  It was — and, you know, these people were petrified of it.  I’ll tell you, these companies — they run these big companies — they were petrified of it.  It was like — you know, I don’t think they believed it.  I’m sure they didn’t believe it.  Some, I know, didn’t believe it, but they were so afraid.\nNear the top of the agenda for our historic Republican majorities in Congress is to pass a massive tax cut for American workers and families.\nLast year, we campaigned across the country on a pledge that I’m sure most of you didn’t hear too much about — a pledge to take the Trump tax cuts and make them permanent, and that’s exactly what we’re doing.  (Applause.)\nIn the coming weeks, I’ll be working with Congress to get a bill on my desk that cuts taxes for workers, families, small businesses, and, very importantly, keeps my promise for a thing called — and I know you didn’t hear anything about this, and I’m sure it had no influence on the state; the fact that we won this crazy, massive majority — the state that hadn’t been won by a Republican in decades.  But I’m sure you haven’t heard, but we’re going to get it for you: No tax on tips.  Right?  (Applause.)  No tax on tips.  Right?\nSo, if you’re a restaurant worker, a server, a valet, a bellhop, a bartender, or one of my caddies — I go through caddies like candy — (laughter); if I play badly, I always blame my caddy — (laughter) — or any other worker who relies on tipped income, your tips will be 100 percent yours.  Won’t that be nice?  (Applause.)\nJoe — Governor, do you think that had an impact on the election?\nGOVERNOR LOMBARDO:  Absolutely!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You do?  Like, what, a half a point?  (Laughter.)  It’s pretty big.  You had an impact, let me tell you.\nNationwide, over 4 million workers depend on tip income, including an estimated 700,000 single moms.  And here in Nevada, we will have a quarter — think of it, a quarter of the typical restaurant worker’s pay comes from tips.  I didn’t know that much.  That’s a lot.  You haven’t been reporting them for the last 10 years.  (Laughter.)\nSo, here’s our deal, we’re going to have no tax on tips from now on, but we’re going to go after you viciously for all the money you didn’t report for the last ten, fif- — (laughter) — we’re going to go after you for all the money you didn’t report for — I’m only kidding.  (Laughter.)  I’m only kidding.  I have to say to the fake news, because they’re going to say, “Trump is after all restaurant workers.”\nMany of these workers are some of the very citizens who were hit hard and very hard by the ravages of the Biden economy, which was inflation.  When I think of Biden, I think of incompetence — (laughter) — and inflation.  I’m being nice by saying — I’m being nice when I say that.  Yet, even in the midst of the suffering he created, Joe Biden launched a cruel campaign to extract more money from tip workers, and that’s what happened.\nI’m telling you, a young waitress — I won’t say “beautiful,” because you’re not allowed to say that — (laughter) — as a politician.  It used to be, you could say, “A young, beautiful waitress,” because — and this was a young, beautiful waitress, but I won’t say that because I feel like — (laughter) — I want to continue my political career.  (Laughter.)  If you call some the governor won’t say it.  If you call a woman “beautiful” today, it’s the end of your political career, so I won’t do it.  (Laughter.)\nBut a young waitress — I think you could call “young.”  You’re probably not even supposed to say “young.”  (Laughter.)  You’re probably supposed to say “a waitress.”  (Laughter.)  But a young waitress came up, and I said, “How are you doing?”  And in my restaurant, in the hotel, in Trump — I said, “How are you doing?”  And she said, “Not great, because they’re after me so viciously for tips.  They just want my tip income, and they don’t believe me,” and all of this.\nAnd she said, “It’s terrible.  You know, sir, you should have no tax on tips.”  I said, “What?”  (Laughter.)  I said, “What you just say?”  “No tax on tips.”  That was about the amount of my consultation.  (Laughter.)  It’s true.  No tax.  I said, “What did you just say?  Say those words again.”  “Sir, no tax on tips.”  I said, are you — thank you very much.  You just won the election for” — (applause).\nNo, but, we did research into it.  I think it’s going to be great.\nBut under the Trump administration, the forgotten men and women of our country are going to be forgotten no longer.  You know that.  They weren’t forgotten four years ago.\nOn day one, I immediately halted the hiring of any new IRS agents.  You know they hired — (applause) — they hired or tried to hire 88,000 new workers to go after you, and we’re in the process of developing a plan to either terminate all of them, or maybe we’ll move them to the border.  (Applause.)  I think we’re going to move them to the border.  (Applause.)\nWell, they’re allowed to carry guns.  You know, they’re so strong on guns, but these people are allowed to carry guns, so we’ll probably move them to the border.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  How about no tax on anything?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  (Laughs.)  She said “no tax on any-” — how about just no tax, period?  (Applause.)  We could do that.\nYou know, if the tariffs work out like I think, a thing like that could happen, if you want to know the truth.  (Applause.)\nYou know, years ago, 1870 to 1913, we didn’t have an income tax.  What we had is tariffs.  Where foreign countries came in and they stole our jobs, they stole our companies, they stole our product, they ripped us off, and, you know, they used to do numbers, and then we went to tariff — a tariff system.  And the tariff system made so much money.  It was when we were the richest — from 1870 to 1913 — then we came in with the — brilliantly came in with an income tax.  “No, we don’t want others to pay.  Let’s have our people pay.”  And then you had the depression in 1928, 1929.  I call it 1929.  That was a bad time.\nBut, you know, you didn’t have tariffs, and you had tariffs that ended in 1913.  But it was the richest our country ever was.  That was President McKinley.  In fact, we’re renaming the mountain “Mount McKinley” — in Alaska.  (Applause.)\nYou know what else we’re renaming?  We’re renaming the Gulf of —\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS:  Mexico!\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS:  America!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — Mexico into the Gulf of America.  Right?  (Applause.)\nAnd Mexico — actually, they were thrilled when they heard.  They said, “That’s nice.”\nA few months from now, when I sign our tax cut into law, we’re going to deliver for the tip-earning men and women who make it all work.  I mean, it’s going to be something very special, I think, for you.  It’s going to be a big difference.\nAnd with us today is Jessica Angiano [ph], an employee here at Circa.  This is a nice place, by the way, and I just met your owner.  He’s a nice man.  He’s rich, too — very rich.  (Laughter and applause.)  But Circa is very nice.\nAnd a hardworking single mother of two with incredible children, Jessica is struggling to pay for medical bills to remove a tumor behind her right eye.  She’s had some real difficulty, and she’s currently saving up for a second surgery, which will hopefully be very successful, while also paying for her children’s day care.  Jessica says that no tax on tips would transform her life.  It would make such a big difference.\nSo, Jessica, we’re going to get that for you.  Where are you, Jessica?  You’re around here someplace, huh?  Hi, Jessica.  Oh, so beautiful.  (Applause.)  Very nice.  It’s working out, medically, good?  Everything good?  Going to be good.  I think it’s going to.  You look fantastic.  It’s good.  You look great.\nAlso with us is Lexi York, a 28-year-old cocktail server here at Circa, who’s got big dreams of being an entrepreneur.  Lexi says that no tax on tips will help bring those dreams much closer to reach and she’s going to be one of the biggest proponents for it.  We’re going to have a lot of support when we go before Congress very soon to get that passed.\nLexi, where are you?  Where are you?  Hi, Lexi.  (Applause.)  Wow.  Good.  We’ll get it done.\nAnd we’re also pleased to be joined by Rosanna Maietta, president and CEO of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, which strongly supports this pro-worker reform.  And, Rosanna, would you like to come up and say a few words on behalf of so many people?  Come on up.  Come on up.  (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  We love you, Trump!  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.)\nMS. MAIETTA:  It’s so nice to meet you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nMS. MAIETTA:  Thank you.\nHello, Mr. President, on behalf of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, I’m so honored to be here today.  We represent 30,000 members around the country in an industry that represents more than 2 million hotel workers.\nAnd I am here to tell you that the American dream is alive and well in the hotel industry today.  (Applause.)  It is still one of the few places where you can have and grow your career, starting a job as a housekeeper or a dishwasher or bellhop, to running a hotel, to owning a hotel or a few, and to even becoming the CEO of a global brand or president of the United States.  (Applause.)\nMr. President, in 2017, the tax bill that you championed cut taxes for so many working families and American workers.  It helped small businesses — small bus- — hotel owners in our country, who make up the majority of the industry, reinvest in the economy, spurring jobs and — and cur- — and growing and strengthening the economy.\nAnd the no tax on tips builds on that momentum, and so we are so excited to support you in that effort.  That’s why we’re here today.\nWe stand with you to urge Congress to pass this proposal so that more than the 800,000 hotel workers who benefit from these — from tips, many who are here in the room today, representing all — all types of jobs — from restaurant workers to housekeepers to bellhops and so many others — can take home more of the pay that they earn every day.\nSo, thank you for having us and for promoting this proposal.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Well done.\nThank you very much, Jessica [Rosanna].  Great.\nAfter for you- — long years — and these were long years — of a government that always put you last — they put America last, they put you last, they put everybody last that was associated with us — you once again have a president that is putting our workers first, putting our families first, and above all, putting America first, and we’re going to keep America first.  And you see it.  (Applause.)\nWe’re restoring our prosperity.  We’re restoring our borders.  We’re restoring our strength, our dignity, and our pride.  We’ve been hurt badly by this group of people — this group of people.  They didn’t have a clue what the hell was happening.  It’s so disgraceful that they were allowed to do it.\nBut quite honestly, we’re restoring our country.  Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency at our southern border.  (Applause.)  I sent active-duty troops to the border to help repel the invasion.\nTom Homan is leading the charge.  You know that.  We like Tom Homan, right?  Doing a great job.\nWe immediately halted all illegal entry and began sending every border trespasser and violator back to the places from which they came.  (Applause.)\nI signed an order that will designate the cartels as “foreign terrorist organizations.”  (Applause.)  It’s a big deal.  That’s a big deal.  Biden didn’t want to do that.  “No, I don’t want to that.”  Biden didn’t know he was alive.  (Laughter.)  He didn’t want to do it.  He didn’t want to do that.\nI always wanted to do it, you know?  I mean, think of it.  Is that a terrorist organization or what?\nAnd we began to leverage the full and immense power of federal government and state government and enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to American soil.  And we don’t allow people to enter our country and to dump their prisons into the United States of America anymore.  (Applause.)  When we see that, our people are instructed to do whatever they have to do.  They can do whatever the hell they want to do.\nThroughout this week, the heroes of ICE have been hunting down and arresting hundreds of illegal alien criminals.  (Applause.)  And it’s immediate expulsion, including those with charges of convictions for rape, child sexual assault, terrorism and even murder.\nMembers of the savage Venezuelan prison gang known as Tren de Aragua — you know that gang?  This is not a nice group of people.  They formed in prison, and then they dumped their prisons into our country.  So, we had them all over the place.\nAsk Colorado.  The governor of Colorado, he doesn’t know what to do about it.  They’re all over the place.  We’ll get them out.  We’ll get them out.  (Applause.)\nThey’re — in a sense, they’re in the real estate business.  They go into a building, and they take it.  You know?  (Laughter.)  See, when you buy a building, you have to go out and get a mortgage or use your own cash.  They just go into a building and take it.\nAnd they actually said, “Well, it’s not that bad.  They haven’t taken that many buildings.”  Can you imagine that?  “They haven’t taken that many buildings.  Oh, they’re not that bad.”  But they’re bad as the bloodthirsty MS-13 gangs that we have gotten thousands and thousands of them out.\nIn fact, over 11,000 murderers were released into our country by other countries all over the world because of Biden’s open-border policy.  When I heard about that, I said, “They’re just going to — everybody is going to empty out their prisons into our country.”  I said that.\nI’d do that if I were heading up any one of the many countries that you know about.  Not just South America, all over — they take their prisons, their mental institutions and they empty them out into our country.  Can you imagine a person doing this?  Can you imagine somebody doing that to our country?\nFor American citizens, January 20th, 2025, was truly liberation day.  (Applause.)  That was really liberation day.\nThis week, I also signed an order to end the weaponization of our government against American people and political people like me.  (Applause.)  We never had a thing like that.  He went after his political opponent.  Who would have thought he helped me?  I think you helped me get elected, Joe, you want to know the truth.  I became much more popular — I’m the only guy that ever became more popular when something like that happened.\nBut they — these guys were just so inept.  We had the guy Deranged Jack Smith — deranged.  He was a deranged human being.\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But they thought this way Biden could sneak by and he could win an election, another — cheating in another election.  That’s what it was.  But we won.  We won.  You think that was fun?  You think that was easy?  (Applause.)  It wasn’t fun.\nAnd investigate all of the abuses of power — I pardoned hundreds of political prisoners who had been viciously persecuted — (applause) — by the Biden regime.  Hundreds of people were persecuted, including Christians, pro-life activists, two Washington, D.C., police officers just yesterday, whose lives were destroyed from chasing down a dangerous, illegal alien criminal.\nAnd of course, I was very proud to pardon the J6 hostages.  (Applause.)\nOnce and for all, I stopped government censorship, and we brought back free speech in America.  We brought it back.  We did more in this last week — people can’t even believe it.\nI also signed an order to declassify and publish all remaining files related to the assassinations — (applause) — of President John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, Jr.\nI signed an order that will end all of the lawless diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense — (applause) — all across the government and the private sector.  We abolished 60 years of prejudice and hatred with the signing of one order, all approved by the United States Supreme Court.  We’re allowed to do it because we are now in a merit-based world.  (Applause.)  We’re a merit-based country.\nDid you ever think you’re going to hear that again?  It’s based on merit.  If you’ve got the talent, if you’ve got the work, the ethic, the whole thing, it’s based now on — it’s not based on any other thing.  It’s based on merit.  It’s based on your capability.\nThe United States has now become, again, a meritocracy.  Isn’t that a beautiful word?  A meritocracy.  Based on merit — if you do your job well, you’re going to go places.\nAnd I made it the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.  (Applause.)  Male and female.\nEvery single day of my term, we’re living by the motto “Promises made, promises kept.”  I kept my promises.  It’s why we won.  It really is why we won.  We won because of the past four years.  We won because of that.\nBut this is going to blow it away, because when I came in, I had no experience.  I didn’t do this before.  I never did this.  I was never a politician before.\nI was talking — JD Vance — by the way, hasn’t he done a great job, JD Vance?  (Applause.)  Because JD went right to the Senate, and then he went to the vice president.  I said, “JD, you’re really upwardly mobile.”  He said, “You’re more so than me.”  I said, “Why do you say that?”  He said, “You went from being a real estate developer to the president.”  That’s a pretty big — I never thought of it that way.  I guess I’m the most upwardly mobile politician in history.  (Applause.)  I didn’t make any stops along the way.\nIt will be the greatest honor of my life to serve not once but twice — or three times or four times.  (Laughs.)  No.  (Applause.)  Headlines — headlines from the fake news.  No.  No, it will be to serve twice.\nFor the next four years, I will not rest, I will not yield, and together we will not fail.  We will win, win, win.  (Applause.)  We will bring back the American dream.  We’re going to bring it back.\nYou know, in recent years, our nation has suffered greatly, but we are going to make it great again, greater than ever before.  We’ll be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism.  That’s what we’re doing, and that’s what it’s all about.\nAnd you see that — I think you see it more in the last week than you’ve seen it in years.  And I walked up the stairs of that massive plane that’s waiting for me, that big 747, and I said, “There’s no way I’m going to let myself fall because that was — (laughter) — that was one hell of a” — that triple fall was a disaster.  I would call that a political disaster.\nYou can fall once, you can fall twice, but you can’t fall three times.  (Laughter.)  You can’t fall three times.  What a disaster.  I’ve used that in every ad I think I ever did.  (Laughter.)\nOur power will stop all wars and bring new spirit of unity to a world that’s been angry, violent, and very unpredictable.  America will be respected again and admired again, including by the people of religion, faith, and goodwill.  We’re bringing back religion in this country.  (Applause.)\nWe will be prosperous.  We will be free.  We will be bigger, bolder, and more ambitious than ever before.  And together, we will make America powerful again — (applause); make America wealthy again — (applause); make America healthy again.  (Applause.)  We will make America strong again.  (Applause.)  Make America proud again.  (Applause.)  We’re going to make America safe again.  (Applause.)\nAnd we will —\nAUDIENCE:  Make America great again!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — make America great again!  (Applause.)\nThank you very much.  And thank you very much, Nevada.  Thank you, Joe.  Thank you very much.\nWe’ll be back.  We’ll be back.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you, my man.  Great job.\nThank you, everybody.  (Applause.)\nEND                    1:40 P.M.

Within 30 days from the date of this order, each designated official shall identify any regulatory hurdles that unduly burden each respective water project, identify any recent changes in state or Federal law that may impact such projects from a regulatory perspective (including Public Law 118-5), and shall develop a proposed plan, for review by the Secretaries, to appropriately suspend, revise, or rescind any regulations or procedures that unduly burden such projects and are not necessary to protect the public interest or otherwise comply with the law.  In so doing, each designated federal official will coordinate and share all appropriate information that will enable improved efficiencies.  For the purposes of this order, “unduly burden” means to unnecessarily obstruct, delay, curtail, impede or otherwise impose significant costs on the permitting, utilization, transmission, delivery, or supply of water resources and water infrastructure.\nSec. 3.  Ending the Subsidization of California’s Mismanagement.  (a) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall review all Federal programs, projects, and activities for all relevant agencies that impact land management, water availability, water supply, water storage and delivery, water infrastructure, and disaster preparedness and response.\n(b)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, to ensure that State and local jurisdictions promote sensible land management practices and reliable water supply for all Americans, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, regarding California State and local policies or practices inconsistent with sound disaster prevention and response.\n(c)  The Director of OMB, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall recommend appropriate action to the President, regarding:\n(i)   any lack of compliance by California with the terms of existing Federal grants, contracts, or other financial assistance to States or localities; and\n(ii)  beneficial additional terms that may be added with respect to any future Federal programs, projects, or activities to ensure sound disaster prevention and response.\nSec. 4.  Additional Actions to Help Los Angeles Families.  (a)  Housing Displaced Families.  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Administrator of FEMA, shall expeditiously provide an Integrated Federal Housing Strategy and Implementation Plan to the Director of OMB and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs that expedites options for housing relief to survivors displaced by wildfires in California.\n(b)  Expediting Waste Removal.  Within 5 days from the date of this order, to accelerate the rebuilding of areas devastated by the recent Los Angeles wildfires, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Administrator of FEMA, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall develop and execute a plan to expedite the bulk removal of contaminated and general debris.\n(c)  Effectively Using Grants to Improve Fire Preparedness.  The Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Administrator of FEMA, shall immediately implement a plan to enable the timely and appropriate use of Federal preparedness grants for the City of Los Angeles.  As of the date of this order, the city has yet to use the majority of its $213 million allotment that has accrued since fiscal year 2021.  These Federal preparedness grants shall not be used to support illegal aliens.  The Attorney General, in coordination with the FEMA Administrator, shall investigate the misuse of these grants by the City of Los Angeles and take appropriate action to address such misuse.\nSec. 5.  Additional Actions to Help North Carolina Families.  (a)  Clearing Roads.  To accelerate rebuilding and community recovery, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Administrator of FEMA, and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration shall immediately take all necessary and appropriate measures, including through direct assistance, loans, and other available means, to expedite roadway clearance or rebuilding, including the section of Interstate 40 in North Carolina that remains closed, and the repair or rebuilding of roads and bridges on private property in areas of North Carolina affected by Hurricane Helene.\n(b)  Housing Displaced Families.  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, shall immediately provide an Integrated Federal Housing Strategy and Implementation Plan to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs that expedites options for housing relief to survivors displaced by Hurricane Helene.\nSec. 6. General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 24, 2025."

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1.  Purpose and Policy.  The Federal responses to Hurricane Helene and other recent disasters demonstrate the need to drastically improve the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (“FEMA’s) efficacy, priorities, and competence, including evaluating whether FEMA’s bureaucracy in disaster response ultimately harms the agency’s ability to successfully respond.  Despite obligating nearly $30 billion in disaster aid each of the past three years, FEMA has managed to leave vulnerable Americans without the resources or support they need when they need it most.\nThere are serious concerns of political bias in FEMA.  Indeed, at least one former FEMA responder has stated that FEMA managers directed her to avoid homes of individuals supporting the campaign of Donald J. Trump for President.  And it has lost mission focus, diverting limited staff and resources to support missions beyond its scope and authority, spending well over a billion dollars to welcome illegal aliens.\nAmericans deserve an immediate, effective, and impartial response to and recovery from disasters.  FEMA therefore requires a full-scale review, by individuals highly experienced at effective disaster response and recovery, who shall recommend to the President improvements or structural changes to promote the national interest and enable national resilience.\nSec. 2.  Establishment.  (a)  There is hereby established the Federal Emergency Management Agency Review Council (“Council”).\n(b)  The Council shall be composed of not more than 20 members.  The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Defense shall be members of the Council.  The remaining members shall include relevant agency heads and distinguished individuals and representatives from sectors outside of the Federal Government appointed by the President.  These non-Federal members shall have diverse perspectives and expertise in disaster relief and assistance, emergency preparedness, natural disasters, Federal-State relationships, and budget management.\n(c)  The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Defense shall serve as Co-Chairs of the Council.  The Co-Chairs may designate up to two Vice Chairs of the Council from among the non-Federal members of the Council, to support the Co-Chairs in the leadership and organization of the Council.\nSec. 3.  Functions.  (a)  The Council shall advise the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, on the existing ability of FEMA to capably and impartially address disasters occurring within the United States and shall advise the President on all recommended changes related to FEMA to best serve the national interest.\n(b)  The Council shall meet regularly and shall:\n(i)   respond to requests from the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security Affairs, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or the Co-Chairs for information, analysis, evaluation, or advice;\n(ii)  solicit information and ideas from a broad range of stakeholders, including Americans affected by natural disasters; the research community; the private sector; State, local, and Tribal governments; foundations; and nonprofit organizations;\n(c)  The Council shall produce a report for the President that includes the following:\n(i)     An assessment of the adequacy of FEMA’s response to disasters during the previous 4 years, including sufficiency of staffing;\n(ii)    A comparison of the FEMA responses with State, local, and private sector responses — including timeliness of response, supplies provided, efficacy, and services (including communications and electricity) provided — during the same period;\n(iii)   An account of the commentary and debate about the role and operation of FEMA in our Federal system and about the functioning of disaster relief, assistance, and preparedness in the United States;\n(iv)    The historical background of other periods in the Nation’s history both before FEMA was part of DHS and before FEMA existed and methods by which disaster aid and relief were then provided;\n(v)     The traditional role of States and their coordination with the Federal Government in securing the life, liberty, and property of their citizens in preparation for, during, and after disasters;\n(vi)    An evaluation of whether FEMA can serve its functions as a support agency, providing supplemental Federal assistance, to the States rather than supplanting State control of disaster relief;\n(vii)   Other recommended improvements to FEMA in the current statutory structure; and\n(viii)  An analysis of the principal arguments in the public debate for and against FEMA reform, including an appraisal of the merits and legality of particular reform proposals.\n(d)  The Council shall solicit public comment, including other expert views, to ensure that its work is informed by a broad spectrum of ideas.\n(e)  The Council shall hold its first public meeting within 90 days of the date of this order and submit its report to the President within 180 days of the date of the Council’s first public meeting.\nSec. 4.  Administration.  (a)  The heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the Council with information concerning disaster preparedness and relief matters when requested by the Council Co-Chairs and as required for the purpose of carrying out the Council’s functions.\n(b)  In consultation with the Co-Chairs, the Council is authorized to create standing subcommittees and ad hoc groups, including technical advisory groups, to assist the Council and provide preliminary information directly to the Council.\n(c)  The Department of Homeland Security shall provide such funding and administrative and technical support as the Council may require, to the extent permitted by law and as authorized by existing appropriations.\n(d)  Members of the Council shall serve without any compensation for their work on the Council, but may receive travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in the government service (5 U.S.C. 5701-5707).\n(e)  Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), may apply to the Council, any functions of the President under that Act, except that of reporting to the Congress, shall be performed by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures established by the Administrator of General Services.\nSec. 5.  Termination.  The Council shall terminate 1 year from the date of this order unless extended by the President.\nSec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 24, 2025."

    "content": "REMARKS BY PRESIDENT TRUMPDURING HURRICANE HELENE BRIEFING Airport Fire and Rescue FacilityFletcher, North Carolina\n11:34 A.M. EST     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  It’s a little cold outside, but you’re getting used to the cold.And one of the things that are very important to me and one of the reasons I’m happy that we won so convincingly is to help North Carolina get fixed up.  They supported us in record numbers, and I’m supporting them in record numbers too.\nAnd they had me set — I wanted to go to Los Angeles and see what was going on with California, why they aren’t releasing the water.  Millions and millions of gallons of water, they’re sending it out to the Pacific.  Someday, somebody’s going — going to explain that one.  In the meantime, they have no water in Los Angeles, where they had the problems. But — so, we’re going there.  But I said, “Well, what about North Carolina?”  “Well, you could do that la-” — “no, I can’t.”  I said, “We’re stopping in North Carolina first, and then we’re going to Los Angeles.” And we just appreciate the outpouring of love that we’ve had here.  Lara was, as you know, very instrumental in the campaign, and she lived here and is loved, and we appreciate it.  And Michael Whatley has been incredible — wherever Michael is — hello, Michael.  Michael Whatley has been great.  And your congressmen have been great.  And what we thought we’d do is take a quick look around.  First, we wanted to do this.  I — I want to say that we’re very disappointed in FEMA.  Your new governor, it’s not his fault.  He’s brand-new to the whole situation.  But we’re going to work together with the governor.  We’re going to work together with the — your senators, but, really, we’re going to work a lot with your congressman, especially the three that are in the area, and Michael Whatley.  And I’d like to put Michael in charge of making sure everything goes well.  And Franklin Graham has been unbelievable.  We’ve made a big contribution to Franklin, and we’ll continue to do so.  But I — I’ve been hearing nothing but praise for the job that Samaritan’s Purse has done with Franklin, and we appreciate it.  Where is Franklin?  He’s around here someplace.  (Laughter.)  And — that good-looking guy.  He’s always been a good-looking guy.  His father was a good-looking guy, too, I’ll tell you.  We loved his father, right?  I saw his father in the latter years, and I said, “Well, he — he doesn’t have long to go.”  He was having a hard time, and he lived about three, four years after that, right?  REVEREND GRAHAM:  That’s right. THE PRESIDENT:  He — he was — they call — they say he was “good stock.”  He had the ultimate good stock.  But I want to thank you, Franklin.  You were — you’ve been fantastic here.  And everywhere he goes, he — he’s always — he’s always the first one I see.  Does — people don’t realize it, how — how good it is.  A lot of people, they go, “Well, maybe it’s for the people that he’s got.”  And you guys know, because you’re here, but the people that he’s got have done amazing work.  So, I just want to thank everybody.  We’re going to get over and take a look.  We’ll say a few words.  I want to just — I do want to introduce some of the people that we have.  And our first lady — we’ll start with our first lady.  She wanted to be here because of North Carolina.  And then I said, “Well, you can do that, but you’re going to have to come to California too.”  (Laughter.)  THE FIRST LADY:  That’s okay. THE PRESIDENT:  And she said, “That’s okay.”  (Laughter.) And we got to fix that one up too.  That’s — who — do you ever see anything like that one?  It’s — who would have — who would have thought that could have happened.  So, Governor Josh Stein, thank you very much.  We appreciate it.  And we’re going to have a — a very long and good relationship.  Representatives — maybe stand up, if you would, so we — the press can see.  Representatives Chuck Edwards — Chuck, thank you.  Thank you, Chuck.  Tim Moore.  Virginia.  You know Virginia Foxx, a legend — she is such a powerful woman.  Pat Harrigan.  Pat, thank you very much.  Your agriculture commissioner, who I hear is excellent, Steve Troxler — Steve, thank you very much.  Good job, Steve.  You’ve got plenty to do, right? MR. TROXLER:  (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  More than you ever thought.  North Carolina Speaker Destin Hall.  Thank you, Destin.  Thanks, Destin.  Very good.  House Majority Leader Brenden Jones.  Brenden, thank you very much.  We’re making progress, Brenden.  State Representatives Dudley Greene, Karl Gillespie, thank you very much, fellas.  Good, good.  Thank you very much.  State Senators Kevin Corbin, Warren Daniel, thank you.  Thank you very much, Kevin, Warren.  And County Commissioner Jennifer Best, thank you.  Jennifer, thank you. So, Hurricane Helene was one of the worst natural disasters in American history.  It was far worse than it was even billed.  I have never seen such water damage.  It was largely water damage — wind damage, but water damage nobody has ever seen.  I’ve been here, as you know, numerous times, but now I’m here in a position where we can do something, meaning I’ve been in — in office for four days.  And I wanted to come sooner, but actually, they had a little problem with getting, logistically, in here, but I would have been ev- — here even sooner. One oh four — a hundred and four North Carolinians have — at least — have lost their lives.  Is that now a fairly firm number, or are they still finding people?  You know?  Is — what do you think?  They’re still finding people?  Pretty much, okay?  It’s a lot of people.  A hundred and four people lost their lives.  Seventy-three thousand homes were severely damaged or destroyed.  And I’ll tell you, I’ve been to a lot of them, and this was a — this was like lots of hurricanes in one.  I’ve never seen such damage done by water.  And the — the water came, it was violent, and it left, and there was, like, nothing left.  It’s really pretty amazing.  At one point, half of the emergency calls to FEMA went unanswered.  That’s real bad.  FEMA was not doing their job.  The city of Asheville went without running water for two months.  A whistleblower testified that some FEMA employees refused to help people who displayed Trump signs on their properties.  I think that’s true, isn’t it?  I read that.  That’s not nice.  That’s not too nice, is it? But whoever those property people were, thank you very much.  Michael, is that true? MR. WHATLEY:  (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT:  That’s not good — huh? — about the property owners.  You put a Trump sign on it, they wouldn’t help — FEMA.  Earlier this year, FEMA kicked 2,000 North Carolinians out of their temporary housing into below-freezing temperatures.  What was that all about?  Is that — do you know about that?  What happened?  Tell me. STATE SPEAKER HALL:  We had an incompetent administration under Biden.  And we had a disaster, and then we call it “the disaster after the disaster” — that was the FEMA response. THE PRESIDENT:  You had nothing but disaster since then.  I — it doesn’t matter at this point.  Biden did a bad job.  Some residents still don’t have hot water, drinking water, or anything else.  And m- — many of them don’t have quarters.  They don’t have anything.  They got a stipend for what they lost, and we’re going to take care of it.  This is totally unacceptable, and I’ll be taking strong action to get North Carolina the support that you need to quickly recover and rebuild.  We’re working on it very hard. And I think if Michael Whatley does half as good a job for North Carolina as he did for my campaign, we’ll be very happy.  (Laughter.)  Him and Lara were a very powerful team.  So, you think you can handle it, Michael?  I don’t know.  I’m not sure, Michael.  (Laughter.)  I think this is maybe, in many ways, easier.  Okay?  Maybe easier.  But you’re going to lead the team.  Do you want to say who the — who the congressmen are that you want to appoint?  Do you want to introduce them? MR. WHATLEY:  So, we — we have Virginia Foxx and Chuck Edwards and Tim Moore — THE PRESIDENT:  And — MR. WHATLEY:  — whose districts encompass the area (inaudible) — THE PRESIDENT:  And they are the districts that were most severely impacted, right?  You were — you were affected, then, Virginia? REPRESENTATIVE FOXX:  Yes, sir.  Lost my own property. THE PRESIDENT:  Really?  Well, I’ll also be signing an executive order to begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA or maybe getting rid of FEMA.  I think, frankly, FEMA is not good.  I think when you have a problem like this, I think you want to go and — whether it’s a Democrat or a Republican governor, you want to use your state to fix it and not waste time calling FEMA.  And then FEMA gets here, and they don’t know the area, they’ve never been to the area, and they want to give you rules that you’ve never heard about, they want to bring people that aren’t as good as the people you already have.  And FEMA has turned out to be a — a disaster.  And you could go back a long way.  You could go back to Louisiana.  You could go back to some of the things that took place in Texas.  It — it turns out to be the state that ends up doing the work.  It just complicates it.  I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly — we pay a percentage to the state.  But the state should fix this.  If the state did this from the beginning, it would have been a lot better situation.  I think you guys agree with that, right? So, I just want to tell that Ash- — say that Asheville — I know it well.  It’s a great place, and we’re going to have it be a great place again.  That was the one that was most severely affected.  But North Carolina is going to come back bigger, better, stronger than ever before, and you’re going to be very thankful.  And you’ve already seen — I know that it really began four days ago, but you’ve already seen more action than you have in the last three months.  And we’re going to get it together.  We’re informing the Army Corps of Engineers to get going, because you have a lot of river breaks and a lot of areas that you’re going to need some pretty big work.  And they’re on their way.  They’re going to be working very — much harder than they’ve been working in the past.  And we’re going to take care of it.  Any questions from the press of any of the congressmen, governor, anybody? Q    Sir, are you going to sign an executive order on FEMA — getting rid of it?  Can you explain more about signing the executive order to get rid of FEMA, please? THE PRESIDENT:  FEMA has been a very big disappointment.  They cost a tremendous amount of money.  It’s very bureaucratic, and it’s very slow.  Other than that, we’re very happy with them.  Okay?  (Laughter.) And I think it’s — I think when there’s a — when there’s a problem with the state, I think that that problem should be taken care of by the state.  That’s what we have states for; they take care of problems.  And a governor can handle something very quickly. You know, one of the things I’ve noticed, because I’ve been doing this for a while, and we had a pretty good FEMA.  But I also noticed that when they come, they end up in arguments of — they’re fighting all the time over who does what.  It’s a — just a — it’s just not a good system. This system is so beautifully designed over 250 years, approximately, you know, and we’ll soon be celebrating the 250th year.  It’s going to be a very big celebration.  But it’s been designed very well, and we’re going to leave it that way. When North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, when — everybody knows the governor of Tennessee, I think — everybody.  Do you — do you know everybody here, pretty much?  He’s o- — GOVERNOR LEE:  I — I’ve introduced myself.   THE PRESIDENT:  I never thought of it, but you’re right over the ridge, right? GOVERNOR LEE:  Right over the hi- — right over the hillside. THE PRESIDENT:  So — so, you’re here to help.  That’s great. GOVERNOR LEE:  These here, thi- — the people in this region, including Tennessee — the people of Appalachia are grateful that you are here and that you haven’t forgotten them.  THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah. GOVERNOR LEE:  And that there are other disasters, but this one was enormous for both North Carolina and Tennessee.  So, thank you. THE PRESIDENT:  You know, I’ve seen a lot of disasters, and this — when I came — I came here right after, the day after.  And when I came here, I couldn’t believe it, actually.  I couldn’t believe the damage.  I — and I’ve seen a lot of them.  This was — this was more like a tornado than it was — what we witnessed.  So, we’re going to get it very much — very much taken care of.  Good job.  That’s nice that you came. GOVERNOR LEE:  Thank you, sir. THE PRESIDENT:  And so, you call it right — you’re right over the ridge, right?  Tennessee. GOVERNOR LEE:  Right over the ridge, yes, sir. THE PRESIDENT:  I like Tennessee, too.  Let’s see.  Where did I get more votes — Tennessee or North Carolina?  I hate — (laughter) — I hate to tell you, North Carolina, it was Tennessee.  GOVERNOR LEE:  There’s one of the counties in this disaster that had 88 percent for you.  So (inaudible) — THE PRESIDENT:  Eighty-eight percent, yeah?  That’s — the people are just incredible people. GOVERNOR LEE:  Yeah. THE PRESIDENT:  So, do you have any questions, press? Q    Yes, Mr. President, you talked about conditions being placed on aid to California — voter ID and the like.  Are there any conditions that you’re going to put on aid to North Carolina? THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, we’re going to do a lot for North Carolina.  You know, they’ve been very slow.  I don’t know why it’s been so bad.  This has been one of the worst I’ve seen.  Katrina, of course, you know, was somebo- — something that — obviously, that was a long time ago — that was not good.  But this has been very slow.  I don’t know if that was for political reasons because they lost the state.  You know, Biden lost the state.  Maybe he felt — he doesn’t care.  Maybe there were other reasons.  I don’t know. But this has been very slow.  By any standard, this has been very slow.  And we’re going to — we’re going to make up for lost time. Q    But no conditions you’re going to push for aid, just full stop? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, in California, I have a condition.  In California, we want them to have voter ID so the people have a voice, because right now, the people don’t have a voice because you don’t know who’s voting and it’s very corrupt.  And we also want them to release the water.  If they release the water, they wouldn’t have had a problem.  If they released the water when I told them to — because I told them to do it seven years ago — if they would have done it, you wouldn’t have had the problem that you had.  You might have — you might not have even had a fire. So — but here, I don’t have that.  It’s a different thing.  You got hit by a storm.  The people are incredible.  They worked really well.  Franklin was fantastic, and other groups — by the way, other groups came in that were also fantastic.  And other states came in; Tennessee and a couple of others came in, and they really helped.  That’s the way it’s supposed to be. No, this is a different kind of a thing. Q    Mr. President, have you decided how much funding you would allocate for disaster relief in North Carolina? THE PRESIDENT:  About what? Q    Have you decided how much funding you would allocate for disaster relief? THE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t de- — I have to see what it is. Q    Mr. President — Q    Are — are — are you disappointed that Senator Schiff hasn’t joined you on this trip?  It’s reported that you invited Senator Schiff to join you on this trip, and he was too busy.  Are you disappointed by that? THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know, I — I was told that Schiff was going to travel with us to California.  I wasn’t thrilled, to be honest with you.  (Laughter.)  And I saw him last night on television.  It looks like he got hit with a baseball bat or something.  What happened to him?  Something happened to him. Q    Are you still — THE PRESIDENT:  It was a little — it looked like he got hit.  It looked like he got beat around, but — Q    So, did — did you invite him or — THE PRESIDENT:  But I’ll ask Karoline to find out what happened to him.  No, if he wanted to come out, I would have done that.  But I don’t know.  I — somebody said that he wanted to come on the plane, but I think he’s staying back for the votes.  There’s some pretty good votes going on. Yeah. Q    Mr. President, what is your timeline for getting rid of FEMA? THE PRESIDENT:  I — I woul- — for the — for this one?  For this one?  Well — Q    For — you just talked about possibly getting rid of FEMA.  What timeline are you looking at, and how would you do that? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re looking here — here, you’re talking about.  To start — we’re going to start immediately — timeline.   And to finish, it’s going to be a period of time.  You know, people are also rebuilding their houses.  How long does it take to build a house, right?  It takes a time. And I want them to build houses bigger, better, nicer than they had before, so they can have — at least they get something out of this disaster.  This was a real disaster. No, timeline will be fast.  In terms of infrastructure, I think very fast.  I want to thank Elon, because Elon was able to get us communication systems, as you know — Starlink.  We had no communication.  The first day I got here, I was asked by one of the people, one of the really great representatives, professionals that — “Is there any way you could get Starlink here,” because they had no communication whatsoever.  And I called up Elon Musk, and he had, you know, hundreds of units brought here — like, brought immediately.  And it’s hard to get; they couldn’t get them before.  And that made a lot of difference.  I think it saved a lot of lives, actually. Yeah.  Infrastructure-wise, we’ll do it quickly. Q    Sir, can you just talk about how long you might — do you think it might take to get rid of FEMA?  What’s the timeline on that if you’re going to roll it back? THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  I would say, look, as far as I’m concerned, I’m not really thinking about FEMA right now here.  I’m thinking about Michael Whatley, and I’m thinking about the three congresspeople that you just heard from and also the other people in Congress.  And they’ll be working with the governor.  They’ll be working with the governor.  So, that’s what I see. Q    Change of subject real quickly.  The Laken Riley Act was signed by Mike — Speaker Johnson yesterday.  When do you — THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah. Q    — when do you anticipate to put — to sign that in the Oval Office?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re honored by that.  Laken Riley — I was there at the time, and we had a big meeting with the parents right after that horrible thing took place.  And we have a — an act.  You all know what that act represents.  And it was a bipartisan bill.  Many Democrats signed — signed on to it.  That’s something that is a tribute to Laken, a beautiful young lady who was killed viciously by an illegal alien.  And we passed a very powerful bill, and it was just approved.  And we’ll have a ceremony sometime very shortly. I’ll be signing it.  In other words, if you’re asking, I will definitely be signing it.  Okay? Yeah. Q    Mr. President, the security detail for Anthony Fauci was terminated last night, and I’m wondering if you have any comment on that? THE PRESIDENT:  About what? Q    The security detail for Anthony Fauci was terminated last night, sir.  Do you have a comment? THE PRESIDENT:  No, I think, you know, when you work for govern- — government, at some point, your security detail comes off.  And, you know, you can’t have them forever.  So, I think it’s very standard.  If it would be for somebody else, you wouldn’t be asking the question.  The question is very fair, but, you know, you work for government — we took some off other people too — but you can’t have a security detail for the rest of your life because you worked for government. Q    Did you ask for it to be taken off, sir? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’ll see what happens. Q    Would you feel partially responsible if something were to happen to, say, Dr. Fauci — THE PRESIDENT:  No. Q    — or John Bolton? THE PRESIDENT:  No.  You know, they all made a lot of money.  They can hire their own security too.  All the people you’re talking about, they can go out — I can give them some good numbers of very good security people.  They can hire their own security.  They all made a lot of money.  Fauci made a lot of money.  They all did.  So, if they, you know, felt that strongly, I — I think that — certainly, I would not take responsibility. Q    North Carolina is a state that relies on trade and manufacturing.  Are you going to have an announcement on new tariffs coming soon?  Is there a timeline now? THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, the tariffs are going to make our country rich.  We’re going to be a rich, rich country very soon.  Tariffs are going to make it rich.  And competence — we have common sense, competence, and tariffs.  The word “tariff” is one of the most beautiful words in the dictionary.  Q    Jonathan Reynolds, the — the business secretary of the United Kingdom, said that there’s an even trade between the U.S. and — and the UK, so they shouldn’t have tariffs.  Does trade imbalances or a balanced trade affect tariffs and your decisions? THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, ba- — unbalance and balance, and also deficits, like with Canada.  We lose $200 billion a year with Canada.  That’s because we allow them to make cars.  We allow them to take lumber.  We don’t need their cars.  We don’t need their lumber.  We don’t need their food products because we make the same products right on the other side of the border.  It’s sort of crazy.  So, we’ve just allowed that — you know, bad management has allowed it, over the last four years, in particular, to become very imbalanced.  And I said to — I call him “Governor Trudeau,” but he’s Prime Minister Trudeau — when he was prime minister, I asked him, “Why would we do that?  Why?”  And he was unable to give me an answer.  He said, “I don’t know.”  And I said, “Do you think it’s fair that we’re paying $200 billion to keep Canada going?”  “And what would happen” — I said — I asked him, “What would happen if we didn’t do that, if we didn’t subsidize Canada?”  He said, “We’d be a failed nation.”  And I said, “Then you should be a state,” because why are we paying all of that money to Canada when, you know, we — we could use it ourselves, right? So, we take care of their military.  You know, we ordered — we’re going to order about 40 Coast Guard big icebreakers.  Big ones.  And all of a sudden, Canada wants a piece of the deal.  I say, “Why are we doing that?” I mean, I like doing that if they’re a state, but I don’t like doing that if they’re a nation. Also, they’ve been very nasty to us on trade.  Historically, Canada has been very, very bad to us, very unfair to us on trade.  So, we’ll see how it all works out. Q    So, the United Kingdom — THE PRESIDENT:  I would — Q    — might be in a better spot? THE PRESIDENT:  I would love to see Canada be the 51st state.  The Canadian citizens, if that happened, would get a very big tax cut — tremendous tax cut — because they’re very high- — highly taxed.  And you wouldn’t have to worry about military.  You wouldn’t have to worry about many of the things.  You’d have better health coverage.  You’d have much better health coverage.  So, I think the people of Canada would like it, you know, if it’s explained.   But I — just to start off, they’d have a very — they’d have a massive tax cut, and they’d have a lot more business, because then we’d let business go to Canada routinely.  And there’d be no tariffs.  You know, if we did that, there’d be no tariffs. Q    So, the United Kingdom might be in a better spot, then? Q    Can you talk about Samaritan’s Purse?  Reverend Franklin Graham has been a great asset to this state.  Talk a little bit about the way the Samaritan Purse has helped North Carolinians. THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, say it once again.  The first — Q    Reverend Franklin Graham has been a big part of Samaritan Purse and their aid to North Carolina.  I just want to get your thoughts on that.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Well, Franklin Graham has been a big asset to the state.  His father was a big asset to the state, to the country — both of them.  I just think this: I think Franklin and — and other people that are doing what Franklin have done — but I — you know, I’ve known Franklin so long.  He was at the inauguration.  He made a speech, beautiful speech; beautiful prayer.  He just — he does a great job.  And we gave — we made a big donation, and it was — it was money well spent.  Sometimes you make donations, it’s not well spent.  He’s done a great job here.  He’s done a really great job. So, I want to thank you.  We’re going to the site now, and — one of the sites — and we’ll — I think you’ll — for those that haven’t seen it, you won’t even believe it, but not enough work was done.  We’ll get it done fast.  And I can speak for the Republican congressmen, we’re going to knock it out, right?  We’re going to knock it out.  And I think we take it very personally, because it was — North Carolina was very unfairly treated — very, very unfairly treated.  And it was obvious.  It was too obvious.  And we’re going to make up for lost time.  So, thank you to the people of North Carolina.\nThank you, everybody.\nEND                11:57 A.M.

Thank you, President Trump.”American Petroleum Institute President and CEO Mike Sommers: “Americans sent a clear message at the ballot box, and President Trump is answering the call on Day 1.

We support efforts to cut unnecessary regulatory red tape and to pursue federal housing program enhancements that make renting and homeownership more attainable and sustainable.”Professional Trucking Association Group: “President Trump’s decision to freeze regulations and curtail bureaucratic overreach is commendable. This is precisely what America needs: reduced government interference and increased freedom for small trucking businesses and entrepreneurs to flourish.”NetChoice CEO Steve DelBianco: “Upon returning to office, President Trump showed that America is ready to lead in tech and innovation again. By repealing Biden’s restrictive rules on energy production and AI development, the president is steering America to remain dominant in creating the best technology in the world.”United Against Nuclear Iran Chairman Governor Jeb Bush and CEO Ambassador Mark Wallace: “We applaud President Trump for his decision today to redesignate the Houthis as an FTO. UANI in its recommended action plan for the Trump administration’s first 100 days suggested that the president redesignate the Houthis as an FTO. This will now provide the U.S. government additional authorities to hold the Houthis accountable for their threats to international commerce and U.S. allies and partners.”\n"

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  Everybody thought I was going to California.  I said, “No, no.  I’m stopping in North Carolina first, because they’ve been abused by what’s happened.”  I mean, it’s terrible.  It should have been done.  It should have been — a lot of things should have happened that didn’t happen.  So, we’re here.  We’re going to fix it out.\nWe’re working with the gentleman behind me, and you know who they are.  And we’re going to fix it, and we’re going to fix it as fast as you can.  It’s a massive amount of damage.  FEMA has really let us down, let the country down.  And I don’t know if that’s Biden’s fault or whose fault it is, but we’re going to take over, and we’re going to do a good job.\nWe’re going to assign Mr. Whatley — who’s fantastic, frankly — and the governor and everybody else that’s going to work.  We’re going to supply the money — we’ll supply a lot of the money.  Maybe you have to chip in something — you’ll chip in a little something, like —\nGOVERNOR STEIN:  We will.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — maybe 25 percent or whatever.\nBut we’re going to get it done as quickly as we can, and we want to take care of the people of North Carolina.\nIt’s so interesting.  Everybody is talking about California, and that’s a mess.  But I said, “I’m not going to California until I stop in North Carolina.”  So, here we are.\nWe’re going to go visit the site, and we’re going to work with probably three of the congressmen — Republican congressmen — who’ve been fantastic — whose areas have been affected, and with Michael Whatley, the governor, and whoever else is — you know, we decide to get involved.\nProbably less FEMA, because FEMA just hasn’t done the job.  And we’re looking at the whole concept of FEMA.  I like, frankly, the concept: When North Carolina gets hit, the governor takes care of it.  When Florida gets hit, the governor takes care of it, meaning the state takes care of it.\nTo have a group of people come in from an area that don’t even know where they’re going in order to solve immediately a problem is something that never worked for me.  But this is probably one of the best examples of it not working.\nAnd there’s been some others, like in Louisiana, et cetera.  So, we’re going to be doing something on FEMA that I think most people agree.\nI’d like to see the states take care of disasters.  Let the state take care of the tornadoes and the hurricanes and all of the other things that happen.  And I think you’re going to find it a lot less expensive.  You’ll do it for less than half, and you’re going to get a lot quicker response.\nSo, that seems to be the recommendation, but we’ll be making that recommendation over the next couple of weeks.\nWe’re going to go to the site now, and we’re going to figure out a plan — a plan for really demolition and cleaning, because not a lot has been done.  And we’re very disappointed in the Biden administration, but we’re going to make up for lost time.\nAnd I said I’d do that, and this is about the earliest we could possibly be here, and we’re honored to be here.  This has been a great state.  They’re great people, and they’ve really been mishandled.  But it’s all — this group is going to be great, and we’re going to get it taken care of.\nAny questions?\nQ    How — how will you respond —\nQ    How will you make those changes to FEMA?  Do you do you expect to ask Congress for additional aid for North Carolina and California?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, it will be direct.  In other words, the aid will go through us.  So, rather than going through FEMA, it will go through us.  And I think maybe this is a good place to start, because — and in all fairness to the governor, in all fairness to everybody else, FEMA was not on the ball, and we’re going to turn it all around.\nYes.\nQ    A lot — a lot of Americans think that this is symbolic of what your campaign was all about: America first, putting your prior- — priorities to Americans, even going to California, where their policies might mo- — have been one of the biggest reasons why they’ve had these problems.  But you’re putting the American people first.  Your thoughts on that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We are.  We’re puttin- — thank you.  I like that question.  Boy, I want more questions like that.  That’s even a statement.  Thank you very much.\nQ    Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT: He’s a good man, that guy, and he’s also a very professional reporter, I have to say.  Thank you very much.\nQ    You’re welcome.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, we’re putting America first.  We’re putting, in this case, North Carolina and California — we’re going to do a good job in California.  That is a disaster like — I don’t know if we’ve ever seen anything like it, frankly.  They say “the biggest in the history of California.”  I think — has anything bigger than that happened in the whole country ever?  It looks like — I don’t want to say what it looks like, but you know what I’m going to say.  It looks like something hit it.\nQ    Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And we won’t talk about what hit it, but it is a bad, bad situation.\nAnd I guess I’m going to meet with some government officials, but, I mean, much more importantly — and in California, just to revert to it for a second, millions of gallons of water are waiting to be poured down through already the half pipes that are already built.  I mean, they’ve been up for 40 years.  And about 20 years ago, they turned off the water.  And it’s the water that comes from the Pacific Northwest — some of it comes out of Canada — and it flows there, and it probably has flowed there for a million years.  And they turned it off, and they route out to the Pacific.\nAnd in the meantime, you don’t have water in the hydrants.  You don’t have water in the sprinkler systems.  It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen.\nAnd everyone’s trying to figure out: Why aren’t they turning it back?  They say it’s the delta smelt — it’s a fish — but I find that hard to believe.  But we’ll —\nQ    Mr. President, what you are —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — figure it out.  And without — and without doing that, you’re going to continue to have problems.\nQ    Mr. President, what are you prepared to do, sir, if OPEC doesn’t respond to your call to cut oil prices?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we want to see OPEC cut the price of oil, and that will automatically stop the tragedy that’s taking place in Ukraine.  It’s a butchering tragedy for both sides, by the way.  A tremendous number of Russian soldiers are dead; a tremendous number of Ukrainian soldiers, and a lot of people are dead from the bombing of the cities.\nBut right now, it’s just bullets whacking and hitting men — mostly men — almost in all cases, men.  And they’re — over a million men are killed, and they’re lo- — they’re losing thousands of people a week.  It’s crazy.\nIt’s a crazy war, and it never would have happened if I was president.  Would never have happened.  This is crazy that it happened, but we want to stop it.\nNow, one way to stop it quickly is for OPEC to stop making so much money and to drop the price of oil, because they have it nice and high.  And if you have it high, that war is not going to end so easily.\nSo, OPEC ought to get on the ball, and they ought to drop the price of oil, and that war will stop right away.\nQ    Will you withhold funding to Los Angeles because of its sanctuary city policy?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I want to see two things in Los Angeles:  Voter ID, so that the people have a chance to vote, and I want to see the water be released and come down into Los Angeles and throughout the state.  Those are the two things.\nAfter that, I will be the greatest president that California have ever — has ever seen.\nQ    Will there —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I want the water to come down and come down to Los Angeles and also go out to all the farmland that’s barren and dry.\nYou know, they have land that they say is the equivalent of the land in Iowa, which is about as good as there is anywhere on Earth.  The problem is it’s artificial, because they artificially stop the water from going on to the land.\nSo, I want two things.  I want voter ID for the people of California, and they all want it.  Right now, you have no — you don’t have voter ID.  People want to have voter identification.  You want to have proof of citizenship.  Ideally, you have one-day voting, but I just want voter ID as a start.  And I want the water to be released, and they’re going to get a lot of help from the U.S.\nThank you very much.  I’ll see you in a little while.\nQ    Will there be (inaudible) —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’ll see you at the site.\nQ    Will there —\nQ    Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’ll see you at the site.\nQ    Can you tell us more about the deportation flights?  Where are they going from?  Where —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s going very well.\nQ    — are they going to?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Deportation is going very well.  We’re getting the bad, hard criminals out.  These are murderers.  These are people that have been as bad as you get, as bad as anybody you’ve seen.  We’re taking them out first.\nThank you.\nEND                11:15 A.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Franklin.  Thank you.  A good man.  He’s done a great job, a fantastic job.\nAnd we’ve come to North Carolina with a simple message for all the people of this region who were hit so hard by Hurricane Helene.  And that message is very simple: You are not forgotten any longer.  You were treated very badly by the previous administration.  And I’m here after a few days of the administration.\nWe’re going to California, Los Angeles.  They got hit hard, as you know.  A lot of that could have been prevented, I think, if they had water, which they had plenty of, but they didn’t use it.\nBut I’m going there, but — and it was set up to go there, and I said, “Well, wait a minute, what about North Carolina?”\nThey said, “Well, what.” I said, “I have to stop there first.  I’m stopping in North Carolina.”\nSo, we made the stop, and I feel very good.  You’re represented by some great people.  Great, great congressmen are with us, and we’re going to get involved with them.\nAnd Michael Whatley is here, who is the head of the Republican Party.  He worked with Lara Trump to take us through to a tremendous victory, one of the — as the media says, one of the most consequential presidential elections ever — they say in 129 years, whatever that may mean.\nBut whatever it is, it was a great election we had, and we won your state.  All three times, we won your state.  And all three primaries, we won your state.  So, we won it six times, I guess, Mr. Congressman, huh?\nAnd it’s a great place.  And I wanted to come here and before I went anywhere, frankly.\nIn the campaign, I promised that I’d come back to western North Carolina to help the people of the state.  And today, here I am to deliver on that promise.  And we have a lot of things in mind, and we’re getting the Army Corps of Engineers all set.  You need your riverbanks fixed.  You need a lot of roads fixed.  And we’re going to get it done in rapid time.\nAnd I’ve asked Susie Wiles and all of my people to start calling up and get the Corps ready, and they’re going to get ready to go.  I don’t know what it is — I don’t know what took so long for the other administration.\nBut remember, I wasn’t here for the first four months or three months, whatever it may be.  See, we can only start as of, essentially, one or two days ago.  And we’ve made a lot of progress over the last couple of days, Michael.\nI understand we’re going to get you the resources you need and the support that you deserve, and we’ll be at your side through every step of the rebuilding.  And no American is going to be left behind.  The people that I just met are so great, and the people that own that house is going to be very beautiful in a little while.  And who knows, if Franklin decides, maybe he’ll rip it down and build them a new one, because sometimes he can do that just as easily.  But we’re going to take care of the people.\nI want to thank our great first lady for coming today.  She really wanted to be here.  She said, “No, I want to go.”  And, you know, she sees what happened and she felt very badly, and she wanted to go.  And we’re then going out together to Los Angeles, but she wanted to be in North Carolina.  She saw what happened.  She has a — she has a feeling like I do for North Carolina.\nSo, thanks, as well, to a great gentleman, Franklin Graham.  And his father, Billy Graham — I used to go with my father to Yankee Stadium and places to watch his father preach.  And he was some preacher.  Where is he — he was some — you got good stock.  You come from the ultimate genes, I can tell you.  But he was really something.\nAnd Franklin, though, has done so much, and his father is looking down on him right now, I guarantee you.  For a long time, he’s been looking down on Franklin, saying, “I’m very proud of you, son.”  He really is, because what Franklin has done with Samaritan’s Purse is incredible.  They told me just yesterday that Samaritan’s Purse has been great.\nBut the FEMA people sort of left you high and dry, but we’re going to change that around.  We’re not happy with FEMA.\nAs well as all of the representatives — you have great representatives here.  Chuck Edwards, who’s here someplace.  Where is Chuck?\nPARTICIPANT:  Right here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Where is Chuck?  Chuck?\nTim Moore.  Tim — thank you, Tim.  Great job too, both of you guys.\nVirginia Foxx, a power — she’s a power, that one.  Don’t — don’t ever have her as your enemy.  It’s not good.  (Laughter.)  It’s not healthy.\nPat Harrigan.  Good job, Pat.\nAddison McDowell.  These guys were just here, just put in, and they’re doing a fantastic job.  Addison, thank you very much.  Great.\nMark Harris.  Thank you, Mark.  Thank you, Mark.\nBrad Knott.  Thank you, Brad.\nGreg Murphy, a fantastic guy — my friend for a long time now, right?\nREPRESENTATIVE MURPHY:  Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And the RNC chairman, Michael Whatley, who really, as I said, brought us to a great victory with Lara the chairman of the party, the whole Republican — I took Michael Whatley from North Carolina, because he did the best job, and put him in charge of everything.  And the job they did together was incredible.\nLast September, Hurricane Helene became one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern American history.  Rainfall rose to far more than 30 inches, which is lethal, unleashing unprecedented devastation throughout western North Carolina and many other states, as you know, but you got hit the hardest.\nThe highest responsibility and deepest obligation of the American government is to protect its people, and that’s never truer than in times of emergency like this.  Unfortunately, our government failed you, but it wasn’t the Trump government.  It was a government run by Biden.  What a terrible situation.  But our government failed the people of North Carolina in this horrible crisis.\nFor two months, Asheville lacked running water.  And even today, some North Carolinians can’t take a hot-water shower.  They can’t drink water.  They don’t know where to get it.  They have to — it’s delivered to them by somewhere.  They just go out and somehow find some.\nIt’s been four months since the storm made landfill [landfall], and still 180 roads remain closed and in ruins.  Earlier this month, the Biden administration kicked 2,000 displaced North Carolinians out of their temporary housing into freezing, 20-degree weather — I don’t know how they did that one, because it was cold — even while your government provided shelter and housing for illegal aliens from all over the world.\nBut under the Trump administration, the days of betrayal and neglect are over.  They are over.\nAs I said in my Inaugural Address, we restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of the American government.  And I think I said most of it in the Inaugural Address.  We said a lot of things, but one of the groups of people I was thinking about is you in North Carolina.  A lot of that was in reference to you and what you’ve had to suffer.\nI’m pleased to announce that under our leadership, the federal government will be surging housing solutions to the state that go beyond mere temporary hotel stays that ended up being very short term.  The government wouldn’t do it any longer, which is ridiculous.\nWe’ll marshal all available resources that bring back potable water and make your water and infrastructure dramatically more reliable very quickly.\nAnd today, I’ll also be signing an executive order slashing all red tape and bureaucratic barriers and permits to ensure the rapid reconstruction of the roads here in western North Carolina.  We’re going to go through a permitting process that’s called “No permitting.  Just get it done.”  That’s the way they built them many years ago, I guarantee you that.  Right?\nWe will get them back very quickly.  And we’ll begin the work of funderv- — fundamentally changing, terminating, or overhauling FEMA.  FEMA has been a disaster, no matter where they are.\nWe’re honored to be joined today, very quickly, by several families affected by the vicious storm.  I’d like to ask each of them to share their story.  Chris and Kim West, you can come forward.  Ramona Nix, Jackie Mitchell, and Thomas Gary Bright, and finally, the Wright family.  And come on up and maybe say a few words.  Please.  Thank you very much.\nHello.\nMS. WEST:  Hi.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Come on in here.\nMS. WEST:  (Laughs.)  Whenever it started, we started moving our vehicles to the top of the road.  And by the time we got the vehicles moved, the water had already hit our ankles in the house.  And so, I grabbed my purse and my little pug dog, and my husband grabbed the dog food and put it in a trash bag.  And by the time we got out into the driveway, it was already waist deep, and there was sticks and that kind of thing.\nI didn’t think I was going to make it, but we did make it out, and we made it to the top of the road.  And we were kind of stuck there for hours because we couldn’t get out any other ways, because it was flooded all the way around.  It took us hours, and we sat there.\nAnd finally, it receded enough to where we could actually get out.  It was probably, like, close to midnight.  And it started like, 5, 6 o’clock in the morning.\nWe just lost everything that we had.  Didn’t even have a brush for, like, three days.  So —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Come on over.\nMS. WEST:  Thank you.\nMR. WEST:  That —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.\nWould you like to say something with that beautiful baby?\nMR. WRIGHT:  Say, “hey.”\nYeah.  So, when the hurricane storms hit North Carolina, hit our home, my daughter and my wife and I were actually out of town.  But unfortunately, my dad, who was still home, and my mother was staying at our house with our — with our animals.\nAnd my — the waters got so high that it actually lifted — between that and the tornado that came through — or microburst is what they’ve been calling them — and lifted his home and the house that I grew up in and crashed it into our barn.  It took away his business.  It took away all of our tools and tractors and everything needed to keep the farm going.\nAnd my mother was trapped in the house, and there was no way to escape because the water got so high.  The only thing she could do was ride it out and wait until the waters came down.\nSo, we’ve been doing a little bit of battling with our insurance and FEMA.  We did have proper insurance, with flood insurance and homeowner’s insurance, but since we had proper insurance, FEMA has not been able to assist us with a whole lot of things.\nAnd, again, we’ve been having some issues with trying to get some payout for our insurance in a timely manner.  We had to do mold mitigation on our home, which is extremely expensive, before the structural engineer even came out in order to get our flood payout.  And to me, that was not really acceptable.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Has the insurance company been responsive, or not really?\nMR. WRIGHT:  Not — not so much.  You know, again —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Are they going to give you they have to give you?  Huh?\nMR. WRIGHT:  I’m — I’m hoping so.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.)\nMR. WRIGHT:  And we might need — I mean, we need some assistance with that.  We reached out to an attorney.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  What’s the name of the insurance company?\nMR. WRIGHT:  North Carolina Farm Bureau.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You’ve got a mortgage, right?\nMR. WRIGHT:  Yep.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s terrible.\nMR. WRIGHT:  That’s what we’re after here.  So —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Are a lot of people having that problem too with the insurance companies, general?  Different insurance companies?  And they’re all difficult, or just the one particular one?\nMR. WRIGHT:  I’ve heard different stories from others, and a lot of folks are —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Have you heard some were responsive, that some were good?\nMR. WRIGHT:  I’ve heard some — some good instances of even Farm Bureau themselves.  But in my case, you know, they’d sent out a third-party adjuster immediately.  Well, they wound up firing that third-party adjuster group.  He gave us a quote for a much higher estimate than what we received.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And he got fired?\nMR. WRIGHT:  And then he got let go.  Yeah, he got fired.  So, then they brought in another third-party adjuster to come in and lowball us.\nWe’ve not received any kind of — so, the flood insurance is our primary insurance.  And so, there was roof leaks in the home that the inspectors found — the adjusters.  Well, that contributed to us losing some of our personal property, as it come in the third story, where there’s no — or second-story living space, where the flood wa- — well above the flood waters.  So, they’ve neglected us for —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Was your mother saved?\nMR. WRIGHT:  Yes, yes, she was saved.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.)\nMR. WRIGHT:  She’s right here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, good.  Okay.  You made it.\nMR. WRIGHT:  So, we — yeah, we made it.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That was not exciting, right?\nMR. WRIGHT:  That’s right.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  How scared were you?\nMS. WRIGHT:  Very.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Did you think you were going to make it?\nMS. WRIGHT:  No.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You didn’t think so?\nMS. WRIGHT:  Nope.  I just started praying.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, you were sort of on a boat?  Your house became a boat, huh?\nMS. WRIGHT:  (Laughs.)\nMR. WRIGHT:  It’s a big pontoon.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Wow.  That’s some story.\nWould you like to say something?\nMR. WRIGHT:  It was a beach house on — on the steps.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’ll bet this guy would like to say something, I can tell.\nMR. WRIGHT:  I was next door to the house, and my son was out of town.  So, when he came in to Charlotte — to my sister’s, he called about 2:00 in the morning, because at midnight, the water was still in the stream.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.  (Inaudible.)\nMR. WRIGHT:  In — within the banks.  So, when he called, the water was coming up.  So, I started moving vehicles up to about 5:30 in the morning.  And she was in the house, and I pulled up to the steps, and I said, “Hop on the fender, and I’ll get you out.”  Well, it — he built a beach house on stilts —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\nMR. WRIGHT:  — five times higher than the floodplain.\nAnd she said, “Well, he said I’d be okay.”\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\nMR. WRIGHT:  “So, I’m staying with the dogs.”\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\nMR. WRIGHT:  So, I went to higher ground with some vehicles, hers included, and the water covered everything.  But I’d already seen it coming around both sides of my place, so I got my blind and deaf dog and a bag of valuables and took up off the side of the hill behind my house.  And then was heading to the cemetery back there because I knew it was open, because there was trees falling —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\nMR. WRIGHT:  — and right uprooting.  It was raining.  I mean, it was —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You never saw anything like that before?\nMR. WRIGHT:  No, no.  I’ve been through floods —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  There’s never been anything like that before.\nMR. WRIGHT:  — all my life around here.  Never, no.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Never been anything like it.\nMR. WRIGHT:  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But you’ve okay, right?\nMR. WRIGHT:  Yep.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  All right.  Come here.\nMR. WRIGHT:  House is destroyed.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, well, we’re going to help you out there.  We’re going to help you out.\nMR. WRIGHT:  Appreciate you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s what we’re here for.\nMR. WRIGHT:  Thanks for being here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Anybody else?  You guys okay?  Please.  Please.\nMR. BRIGHT:  Our day that morning began — I’m a little taller — with some trees falling into our house, which our house is — goes back four generations, 80 years, and never came close to flooding.  And we woke up with trees about 4:30 or 5:00 in the morning.\nAnd our house sits three tenths of a mile back off the road.  And the water — you know, we’ve had flooding and such in the lake, but nothing like we saw.  And like most everybody else, we moved five vehicles as far up — lawnmowers and everything else.  And the water started coming in the house.\nAnd when it got up to about ankle high, we have a loft.  I got her up in that and tried to gather what you might want, which was totally random.  And when it made it to the loft and started getting up to about our hips, I built a little makeshift ladder, and we got out on our roof.  And we spent four hours on the roof.  I had a little baggie.  I — I di- — I did notes on my cell phone to my two kids and my two grandkids and something to identify me, in case we were lost in it.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Did you think you were going to make it?\nMR. BRIGHT:  No.  We — we’re —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, you didn’t think so?\nMR. BRIGHT:  Yeah, we didn’t think we were going to make it at all.  I mean, our house was 25 feet underwater.  And —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, you didn’t think you were going to live?\nMR. BRIGHT:  No, we were watching houses, trailers, bodies coming by us.  And we live in the Azalea Road area of — in East Asheville.  Oteen.\nMS. MITCHELL:  We watched our garage lift up and float away.\nMR. BRIGHT:  Yeah, we watched our garage float by.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It just lift up?\nMR. BRIGHT:  Yeah.\nBut, you know, we — we got to a point where it crested about four feet up on the roof.  We took about three or four hours for it so it could kind of do everything in reverse and got out in the mud to higher ground.  And I got out — higher ground, up toward the Subway and got over to her daughter’s house, where — when she saw that I didn’t have her, she lost it.  And I was like, “She’s okay.  She’s alive.”  And we tried to make our way back in there and gather things best we could.\nBut, you know, found a body right away.  We had — there was about eight bodies in our area that first two weeks, located.  And we were lucky we weren’t one of them and — and blessed.\nBut like other people, no insurance on flood insurance, so we — we had to depend on FEMA.  They did what they could do.  And, of course, it’s not enough.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, no, I know.  (Inaudible.)\nMR. BRIGHT:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.)\nMR. BRIGHT:  Yeah, no, it’s crazy.\nBut, yeah, again, we’re thankful to be alive, but it’s a long haul.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, what are you doing now?\nMR. BRIGHT:  Staying in a camper.  I’ve never been — if you all have noticed, I’m a big guy.  I don’t sleep in campers very — (laughter) — very well.  And the — the first night we spent in the camper — very grateful with the Asheville Dream Center coming through with one and —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Do you still have the land?\nMR. BRIGHT:  Oh, yeah.  It’s — it’s family land.  Yeah, the land, it looks like a beach now; it’s sand.\nMS. MITCHELL:  Yeah.\nMR. BRIGHT:  But —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Can it be built on?\nMR. BRIGHT:  Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Do you intend to do that?\nMR. BRIGHT:  Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You want to build again?\nMR. BRIGHT:  Yeah, Samaritan’s Purse — we’re working with them.  We’re working with people.  We — you know, it’s — it’s 80 years, four generations.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But the house is totally gone?\nMR. BRIGHT:  No, the house is there.  It’s down to —\nMS. MITCHELL:  They — they gutted it to just the rafters.\nMR. BRIGHT:  Yeah, they came in and mudded it, but everything in it was completely destroyed.\nBut, yeah, it’s — it’s tough.  I think we’re at a point in Asheville where peoples forgot about Asheville and —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.)\nMR. BRIGHT:  It’s — it’s stag- — everything is stopped.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.)\nMR. BRIGHT:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Appreciate that.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to take care of you.\nMR. BRIGHT:  Thank you, Jackie.\nMS. MITCHELL:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nMS. MITCHELL:  Thank you.  Stay well.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Please\nMS. NIX:  I’m Pastor Nix.  Our church is right down the road.  We had only purchased in May, and it’s a big church.  We’re a small congregation.  And I had people say, “What are you going to do with this big building?”  And I said, “Only God knows.”  And we had our dedication, and the storm came the next week.\nAnd the outpouring of people — my son brought the first load of supplies.  And from there, I stayed there for about three months.  I slept on the floor for about three weeks because the need was so great.  The people were so devastated.\nAnd I said, “I want to be here for them.”  And they were coming in just day and night, so there’s really no need for me to go home.\nBut we had people from Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Indiana, Oklahoma — people from all over.  We have not received any help — like, from the government — anything.  But I said, “Lord, if you want us to do that” —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible) helped you?\nMS. NIX:  People.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, they came from all over the —\nMS. NIX:  All over the states.\nMR. BRIGHT:  (Inaudible) groups, that’s what — that’s what did it.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But FEMA — FEMA did nothing, right?\nMS. NIX:  No.\nMR. BRIGHT:  It was the — it was the — the locals.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  FEMA is a waste of time and money.\nMS. NIX:  The locals and the people that — that knew us.\nAnd before the week was over, our church was so packed with supplies, we couldn’t even — we couldn’t even walk.  Even in our sanctuary, it was up to the platform —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.\nMS. NIX:  — of things, and in our halls and in our rooms.  And we’re just now beginning to get a little straightened out.\nBut somebody said, “How long are you going to be here?”  I said, “I’m going to be here through the winter and even on, if possible,” because when you meet people that’s been through this struggle — I had a little lady come up, and I said, “Can we do anything special for you?”  And she said, “I don’t want to be selfish,” but said, “Could I have a cup of coffee?”  And I handed her that coffee, and she stood there, and tears just poured.\nShe said, “You don’t realize how — how important the — the little things.”  It’s not the big things in life that we have, but it’s the little things and — and knowing that God is our source.  I don’t look to man.  I don’t have to have a lot of things.  I — I had trees — about 20 trees down in my yard, but that didn’t really matter.  It doesn’t matter, because the needs of the people is what — is what I want to be there for.\nAnd God is good.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s very good.\nMS. NIX:  He’s very good.\nAnd my daughter — now, she — her house is really in bad shape.  And I’ll let her tell you about that.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.\nMS. NIX:  But thank you, President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.\nMS. NIX:  This is our president.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)\nMS. NIX:  We appreciate you so much.\nTHE FIRST LADY:  Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank for all what you do.\nMS. NIX-ROPER:  I live out in the Fairview area of North Carolina and the — near the Bat Cave, Lake Lure area, and our area was hit — it was hit really hard.  I — I was home alone, and my husband had stayed in town because we take care of a little lady that’s 98 years old, and she lives out in the woods by herself.  And I said, “Just stay with her and make sure that she’s okay.”\nAnd I got up the next morning, and my first thought was, “I want to go see what our road and bridge looks like.”\nSo, as I was making it down to the road and the bridge, there was no road and bridge.  And so, you know, here we are.  We’re, like, in a little island.  You know, we can’t access the main road or anything.\nAnd then the fire department came by the next day and said that they were evacuating me and my neighbor because a landslide was going to come, and they told me to get my stuff and get ready.\nAnd so, while I was getting my stuff and getting ready, there was a knock at the door.  So, I thought it was the fireman.  And I went to the door, and there stood my 21-year-old son — his name is Nathan — and he had drove as far as he could to get to me.  But he hiked five miles, and it took him a really long time.  And he got there, and he said — he said, “Mom, grab a bag.  We got to go.”  And I said, “Son, there’s no way I can — I can hike out of here.”  And he’s like, “No.”  He said, “We got to go.”\nSo, we — we started hiking out, and I — and I seen one of my neighbors who — she had no clothes on.  Her — her — she was — her skin was — was, like, chunked up.  It was just — she was blue.  She had been — she had been in the — in the waters.  And where she had went or — or — I don’t know, but it — horrific, is just all I can say.\nBut then, as — as me and my son hiked on out, we went through where this — this place — we call it Craigtown — but there were, like, a lot of family members there that passed away — like 11 of them.  And — and there — there were people out everywhere looking for their loved ones.  And there were — there were dead bodies, you know?  My son’s like, “Mom, you’re going to see things you don’t want to see.”\nAnd so, anyway, we got through all that, but I stayed at our church in our sound booth.  My husband and I, we just slept up in the sound booth for a couple of months because we didn’t have power or anything for about two months out there.\nAnd then we — we have went back.  I’ve been fighting with FEMA since day one.\nOur community — there’s, like, 32 homes.  We don’t have a road and a bridge.  We’re driving through our neighbors’ property.  You know, I went to EMS, and I said, “Look, my concern is, if we have a fire or we have an emergency out here, you’re not going to get to us.  You can’t get those big trucks up here.”\nAnd — and I’ve called and called and called FEMA.  And, you know, I said it’s — this happened on September 27th.  That’s four months ago.  Well, for us, today is still September 27th.  You know, we haven’t had help.\nAnd so, when I talk to FEMA, I’m explaining the road and the bridge, and they send me a letter that tells me to — to basically fix it and send in my receipts, and they’ll refund me some money.  I’m looking at a road and bridge that, honestly, the bridge itself is probably going to be $300,000, and the road could be close to that also, because we have to have — the community has to have big boulders brought in.  We’re not a rich community.  We can’t fix it ourself.\nYou know, it’s just — and as far as, like, house repairs, I’m still pending.  I can’t get money from FEMA until I fix the road and bridge and fen- — and send in my — my proof that it’s fixed and everything.  It’s — it’s just — it’s been a nightmare.  And I totally feel like — that we have been forgotten.\nIf it had not been for — for our fellow American citizens who stepped up to help us, I don’t know what we would have done.  I have — I have five neighbors around me who completely lost everything.  You know, I have damage to my house and — and I feel — I don’t feel entitled.  I’m embarrassed to even say I need help, because, you know — and sometimes there’s even that — that survivors’ guilt, is what they’re calling it.  But you feel guilty to even be alive sometimes, you know, when you look around and you see your neighbors that are gone.\nAnd it’s just, you know — we — we need help.  I wrote a letter that — to send to Congress.  You know, “I don’t understand what’s going on.  If we can’t get FEMA help, then will you guys help us?  Will you step up and be our fellow citizen?  Will you step up and be our neighbor and send us something.  Help us.  Help us get our community back.”\nIt’s — I could go on.  It’s just a — I don’t know, it’s just heartbreaking.\nI appreciate you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nA good daughter you have, huh?  A good daughter.  Take care of mom.  And your son must be great.\nMS. NIX-ROPER:  My son is great.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, he sounds like a real leader and smart.\nMS. NIX-ROPER:  He really is.  Th- — to hike in —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, how would you have been if he didn’t come and get you?\nMS. NIX-ROPER:  I don’t know.  I’d — I’d just been — would have been there until — because the only thing we could do — there were no way to get out there.  The only thing we could do is just hike up to the church, the first church that was up there — about three miles to — to get, you know, maybe what we needed —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You tell him he’s just —\nMS. NIX-ROPER:  — or some — I don’t know.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Tell him he’s a real leader.\nMS. NIX-ROPER:  He is.  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Sounds good.\nWell, again, thank you very much, everybody.\nSo, we’re going to be here.  We’re going to be working with our congressmen and woman, and they’re going to do a job.  And Michael Whatley is going to be very much in charge, and you’ll get it done.\nAnd FEMA is ready to rock.  They haven’t done the job, because they weren’t really told to do the job by Biden.  I guess Biden was thinking about other things, wasn’t he?  But they weren’t told.\nWhat they did to — what the past administration did to North Carolina is a disgrace.\nSo, I just want to wish you all well.  I was here right after the event, and I couldn’t believe it.  I have never seen anything like it.  I’ve seen a lot of bad things, but I’ve never seen anything like it.\nAnd it’s an honor to meet the people behind me, and it’s an honor to be with our congressional delegation and some of the other politicians in the area.  And it’s an honor to have Michael Whatley at my side, because maybe we wouldn’t be standing here as president if he wasn’t.\nHim and Lara — Lara Trump — were unbelievable as the head of the Republican Party.  So, he happens to come from a place called North Carolina.  So, I said, “Michael, fix it.”  (Laughs.)  So, good luck.  Good luck.\nAnd we’ll supply what you need.  You know that.  Okay?  Thank you.\nThank you all very much.  Thank you very much.\nQ    Mr. President, what kind of role will Mr. Whatley have?\nQ    Mr. President, I’m hearing all these heartbreaking stories and how there’s been so many local groups —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    — who have stepped up to —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    — assist these families.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s one of the things you hear.\nQ    Is there any talk on having money — instead of going to FEMA and going through the bureaucracy — to go through them?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, that’s what I want to do.  We want to bring it locally so that a state takes care of its problem, and then they can bring it down to a local level, like Samaritan’s Purse and Franklin, because that’s, you know, one of the better examples.  But you had numbers of people that did a great job.  You have groups that did a great job and organizations.\nThe one that didn’t do a good job was the government.  They did a bad job.  They did in many ways, they did no job.  They weren’t even available.\nSo, good question.  The answer is: We go local. I think it will work much better.\nFEMA is a very expensive organization that really doesn’t work out very well.  It hasn’t.  This is not the only example.\nSo, if it was up to me right now, I’d end it right now, and I’d just let the state take care of the problem.  I mean, you’re going to always have problems.  Let the state — if it’s Florida, it’s a hurricane, let Florida take care of it.  They don’t need FEMA to come in.\nYeah.\nQ    What kind of role do you envision for Mr. Whatley?  Is it within FEMA, outside of FEMA?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I envision a very important role for him.  It’s any role he wants.  He’s a very capable guy.  Michael Whatley, a very capable guy.  And he’s friends and works with these guys.  Keeps them elected, right?  They have to do a good job.  Otherwise, no matter how good Michael is, not going to work.  But they’ve done an amazing job.  They’ve been great.\nYou’re lucky.  You have great congressmen here and — and -woman, by the way — a great woman, very powerful woman.  And they’re going to do a great job.  They’ll do it together.  They’ll work together, and we’ll supply what they need as they need it.  We’ll coordinate that.\nAnd we will immediately get the Army Corps, Michael, because you need roads built.  You know, we’re talking about the bridge, we’re talking about roads and things, so we’ve got to get them built.\nAll right?  Okay?\nThank you all very much.  Thank you very much.\nEND                  1:10 P.M.

EST      THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. So, we’re going to North Carolina.  It’s been a horrible thing the way that’s been allowed to fester, and we’re going to get it fixed up — it should have been done months ago — from the hurricane that took place almost four months ago.  North Carolina has been treated very badly, so we’re stopping there.  And we’re going to then go to Los Angeles and take a look at a fire that could have been put out if they let the water flow, but they didn’t let the water flow.  And they still haven’t for whatever reason.       So, I think we’re going to have a very interesting time.  I think many of you are going with us.  If you’d like to have a ride on the plane, we’d love to give it to you.      Q    Mr. President, why did you invite Adam Schiff on your trip given you called him “scum” earlier this week?      THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know.  Is he — is he going?  Is he going?      Q    No.      THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know.  I mean, I really don’t.  You know, because if he’s going to be there, it would be cheaper,  but I didn’t invite him.  Somebody did.      (Cross-talk.)      Q    Pete Hegseth — Pete Hegseth lost two Republican votes yesterday.  Are you at all concerned about his prospects?      THE PRESIDENT:  Look, whatever it is, it is.  He’s a good man.  I don’t know what’s going to happen; you never know in those things.  But Pete is a very, very good man.  I hope he makes it.  I hope he makes it.      I was very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that.  And, of course, Mitch is always a “no” vote, I guess.  Is Mitch a “no” vote?  How about Mitch?      Q    He hasn’t said yet.      THE PRESIDENT:  Huh?  He what?      Q    He hasn’t said yet.      THE PRESIDENT:  Let’s see what happens.      (Cross-talk.)      Q    The March for Life is today.  Sir, the March for Life.  Mr. President, the March for Life, sir.  Mr. President, the March for Life.  The March for Life is today.       THE PRESIDENT:  I did a big clip for the March for Life, and we look forward to seeing it.  I’m going to be watching it.  And JD Vance, our vice president, is there, and he’s going to be representing us very well.  Taking place in a little while, and other than being a little bit cold, it’s a beautiful day.      (Cross-talk.)      Q    How will your — Mr. President, how will your administration — how will your administration protect —      Q    Mr. President, will you give Italy a break of tariffs?      Q    — sir, how will your administration protect pro-life of Americans going forward? THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, we’re all — we’re all for it.  In fact, as you know, I just signed a pardon, and in the pardon, we released 23 people that were unjustly put in having to do with pro-life.  And they will be released, and they’ll be out very shortly.  It was disgraceful what happened to them.  That was a persecution. (Cross-talk.) Q    Mr. President, will you give — will you give Italy a break on tax — on tariffs, sir? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I like her very much.  Let’s see what happens. Have a good time.  (Inaudible.)\nEND                 9:12 A.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.\nQ    Hello, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You all set?  Okay.  Very good.\nI’m going to sign some executive orders.  They were very important in just about every case.  And we’ll go through the first one, please.\nMR. SCHARF:  Sure.  Do you want to —\nMR. SACKS:  Yeah.  Mr. President, this is an executive order on crypto.  We’re going to be —\nMR. SCHARF:  That’s AI.  Sorry.\nMR. SACKS:  Oh, sorry.  We’re doing AI first.  Sorry.\nMR. SCHARF:  Yeah, AI.\nMR. SACKS:  Sir, this is an executive order on AI.  We’re forming — we’re — we’re basically announcing the administration’s policy to make America the — the world capital in artificial intelligence and to dominate and to lead the world in AI.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Do you want to say your name — your full name and serial number?\nMR. SACKS:  Yeah, David Sacks, AI and crypto czar.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  David is one of the greatest in the world at AI — most respected, probably, there is.\n(The executive order is signed.)\nSo, that should take us to the forefront, right?\nMR. SACKS:  Absolutely.  We got to win.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.      Thank you.\nMR. SCHARF:  Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And this, David, is?\nMR. SCHARF:  Crypto.\nMR. SACKS:  Yeah, this is the crypto EO.  We’re going to be forming a internal working group to make crypto — to make America the world capital on crypto under your leadership.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Which is really going up, right?\nMR.

SACKS:  Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And so is David.  You have to check him out.  There is nobody like this guy.  They said, “How did you get David Sacks?  How did you do that?”  And he’s — he’s doing it for the country more than anything else.  So, we appreciate it, David.  Thank you very much.\nMR. SACKS:  Thank you, sir.\nMR. SCHARF:  This is an executive order establishing a presidential commission — an advisory commission on science and technology.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.\n(The executive order is signed.)\nDo you want to explain that a little bit?\nMR. SCHARF:  The basic idea is to get together top people from government to private-sector technology industry, as well as educational institutions, to make sure that America maintains its leadership position with respect to science and technology development in the years ahead.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  That’s great.\nMR. SCHARF:  Next, sir, we have a presidential memorandum encouraging departments and agencies in your government, including the Department of the Interior, to promote federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe of —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Ohh.\nMR. SCHARF:  — North Carolina.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I love the Lumbee Tribe.  So, this is their first big step, right?\nMR.

SCHARF:  And, if you’d like, I could get them that pen, sir, as well.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, let’s do that.  (The president gives Mr. Scharf the signing pen.)\nMR. SCHARF:  Next, we have a set of pardons for peaceful pro-life protestors who were prosecuted by the Biden administration for exercising their First Amendment rights.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Do you know how many?\nMR. SCHARF:  I believe it’s 23, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Twenty-three people that were prosecuted.  They should not have been prosecuted.  Man- of — many of them are — are elderly people.  They should not have been prosecuted.  This is a great honor to sign this.\n(The proclamation is signed.)\nThey’ll be very happy.\nMR. SCHARF:  Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, they’re all in prison now?\nMR. SCHARF:  Some are.  Some are — are out of custody.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s ridiculous.\nOkay?\nMR. SCHARF:  Lastly, sir, we have an executive order ordering the declassification of files relating to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s a big one, huh?  A lot of people are waiting for this for a long — for years —\nMR. SCHARF:  Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — for decades.  And everything will be revealed.\n(The executive order is signed.)\nOkay.  Give that to RFK, Jr.  (The president gives Mr. Scharf the signing pen.)\nMR. SCHARF:  Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.      Okay.  Thank you very much.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Mr. President — Mr. President, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked the birthright citizenship order.  Do you have any reaction to —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No.  Obviously, we’ll appeal it.  They put it before a certain judge — in Seattle, I guess, right?  And\nthere’s no surprises with that judge.\nQ    Mr. President, Senators Collins and Murkowski have now said they will vote against Pete Hegseth.  Are you worried about his confirmation, and your reaction?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No.  And no surprises there.  It’s too bad.  You know, it’s the way — the way it is.  Too bad.\nQ    And when would you adjourn Congress to make recess appointments, Mr. President?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’d take a look at that.  I’d listen to John Thune.  He’s doing a fantastic job.  We’re moving along.  The Democrats are trying to delay government, as they always do.  They can’t help themselves.  Even John Ratcliffe, who’s very, very strong, very popular and liked by the Democrats — I guess, he gets a lot of Democrat votes — that’s taking a long time, and it shouldn’t be taking a long time.\nThey — they’re maxing everything out so they can delay everything as much as possible.\nQ    Does Senator Thune support an effort to use recess appointments if you choose to do that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’d be willing to use recess appointments.  It’s up to John.  We’ll see.  John Thune is a great guy, great senator, knows his stuff inside out and backwards.  But I would use recess appointments if he wants to do that.  Absolutely.\n(Cross-talk.)\nThe Democrats are just delaying.  They always delay.\nQ    Mr. President, you spoke with the Saudi crown prince yesterday.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Who?\nQ    The Saudi crown prince.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes.\nQ    How was the — the call?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great.  It was great.\nQ    And they said $600 million — billion dollar they can invest?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Six hundred.  I’ll ask them for a trillion.\nQ    You said you’re going to ask them for a trillion.  Will Saudi Arabia be the first foreign country you will visit, since they’re investing that much money?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, if they do that, I would, yeah.\nQ    You would?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I would be glad to do that.  I did it, as you know, four years ago.  We did $450 billion — meaning the money all goes to American companies — and they purchased jets and they purchased computers and everything else.  And we did $450 billion, and I guess we’re at $600, $650.\n(Cross-talk.)\nAnd I’ll see if I can talk them into a trillion.\nQ    And on the Middle East again.  You showed great confidence in Steve Witkoff.  Why you said that you doubt that the ceasefire in Gaza will — will hold since you appraised his efforts?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, no, I think he’s great.  But it’s a very tricky place.  It’s very tricky.  And we’ll see.  And if it — if something does happen, they will not be happy.\nQ    Sir, follow-up on that one.  In terms of Steve Witkoff, are you going to put him in charge of — of Iran strategy?  And do you want him talking directly with the Iranians?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, but he — he certainly is somebody I would use.  He’s done a fantastic job.  He’s a great negotiator.  He’s a very good person, great — a very popular person.  Gets along with people.  I have great negotiators.  They — they have no personality whatsoever, and then I have some that do.\nSteve has a wonderful way about him and people like him.  And even in this case, both sides like him, and he was able to make a deal.  That deal would have never been made without Steve.\nThe Biden people couldn’t make the deal.  They were working on it for a year and a half.  They couldn’t make a deal.  We got it done prior to the inauguration.  We said it has to be before the inauguration.\nI mean, the deal should hold, but if it doesn’t hold, there’ll be a lot of problems.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Related to your AI EO.  Just hours after you made that big Stargate announcement, Elon Musk tweeted that they don’t actually have the money.  Is that true?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know if they do, but, you know, they’re putting up the money.  The government is not putting up anything.  They’re putting up money.  They’re very rich people, so I hope they do.\nAnd, I mean, Elon doesn’t like one of those people.  So, (inaudible).\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Are you worried that AI is going to replace many American jobs?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No.\nQ    Does that worry you?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  It’s going to create tremendous numbers of jobs.  It’s going to also create a lot of benefits, medically, for cancer research and other things.  It’s going to have a huge positive impact.\nAnd, you know, we want to be ahead of China.  We’re, right now, way ahead of China.\nDavid Sacks is one of the all-time experts.  You know, that — people are amazed that he — you just met him.  I don’t know if he’s still here.\nMR. SACKS:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  There he is.\nBut — but one of the most respected people in that world.  It’s a world.  That’s a whole different world.\nAnd we’re ahead of China now because of what I’m doing, and I think it’s going to be very successful.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    On NATO spending, please.  You just asked the Davos forum again that NATO countries should spend 5 percent of GDP on defense.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    The United States don’t spend 5 percent.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I — I don’t think so, no.\nQ    Do you think it should also apply to the United States?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’re protecting them, you know?  They’re not protecting us.  We’re protecting them.  So, I don’t think we should be spending — I’m not sure we should be spending anything, but we should certainly be helping them.  But they should — they should up their 2 percent to 5 percent, yeah.\nQ    Mr. President — Mr. President, you said earlier during your speech at Davos that you would like to see interest rates come down.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    How much would you like to see them come down?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  A lot.\nQ    And will you talk with Powell?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’d like to see them come down a lot, and oil prices will come down.  And when oil prices come down, everything is going to be cheaper for the American people — and actually for the world — but for the American people.  So, I’d like to see oil prices come down.\nAnd when the energy comes down, that’s going to knock out a lot of the inflation.  That’s going to automatically bring the interest rates down.\nQ    Are you worried that it’s too much going on at once if you’re —\nQ    Mr. President, you said that you would demand —\nQ    Are you worried that there’s too much going on at once if you’re trying to bring interest rates down and —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no.\nQ    — get the economy back going?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No.  It just works that way.  I mean, it just economically works that way.  When the oil comes down, it’ll bring down prices, then you won’t have inflation, and then the interest rates will come down.  (Inaudible.)\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    You said that you would demand that the interest rates come down.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I would put in —\nQ    Do you expect —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I would put in a strong statement.\nQ    Do you expect the Fed to listen to you?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    Are you going to talk to Powell about this and — bringing the rates down?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  At — at the right time, I would.\nQ    Sir, do you plan to meet with any of the people you pardoned that were — participated in the January 6th, 2021, attack — do you plan to meet with any of them or meet with them at the White House?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know.  I’m sure that they probably would like to.  I did — I did them something important.  But what they did is they were protesting a crooked election.  And, you know, I mean, people understand that also.  And they were treated very badly.  Nobody’s been treated like that.\nSo, I’d be open to it, certainly.  I — I don’t know of anything like that, but I think they — they’re going to — meeting some of the congresspeople — congressmen, -women —\nQ    Have you spoken to them?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — who want to — want to meet.  But I’d certainly be open to it.\nQ    Have you spoken to them since you issued the pardons?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t spoken to any of them yet, but I know they’re very happy.\n(Cross-talk.)\nI gave them — I gave them their life back.  Their life was taken away from them unnecessarily and unfairly.  I gave them their life back.  So, I can imagine they probably would like to.\nQ    What did you mean when you said that Biden took bad advice in not pardoning himself yesterday?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, he did.  I think he did, because he — he pardoned all these people that are crooked as hell.  Look, the congressmen, they’re crooked.  What they did is they destroyed evidence.  When you destroy evidence, especially criminally like that — they did it criminally.\nAnd the reason they destroyed the evidence is because it proved that I was right.  They didn’t destroy evidence for no reason.  They destroyed it because they found many documents saying that I offered 10,000 soldiers.  If they had 500 soldiers or National Guard, there would have been no problem.  If they had 200, that would have been — I offered 10,000, if they needed them — there would have been no problem.\nThat’s been now totally disproven.  And it’s also been disproven by Nancy Pelosi’s daughter, who has her on tape saying it was her fault, that she has full responsibility for this.\nBut — and they have all that stuff.  They destroyed everything, and they go through a year and a half, two years of nonsense, they come up with tremendous evidence, and they destroyed evidence.\nAnd Schiff knew about it.  That’s why he’s on there.  He knew all about the destruction of evidence.  A lot of people said he’s the one that got them to do it.  And he’s a crooked guy — you know? — totally crooked politician.  And so, he’s pardoned, and some other people are pardoned.\nAnd these are crooked politicians, every one of them.  Bennie Johnson [Thompson], what he did is incredible.  I mean, he was the leader of the committee, and he did it.  Cheney, Crying Adam Kinzinger, all of them — they destroyed evidence and deleted everything.\nThere’s nothing with — there’s no evidence now.  They’re crooked politicians, and they should be punished.  You know, that’s — even in a civil trial, you go to jail for a thing like that.  They destroyed every document, from what I understand — every document — because it proved that I was totally innocent.\nQ    Do you plan to send up to 10,000 troops to the southern border, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Oh, southern border?\nQ    Yes, the border.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  When you say “southern border” — when I said “10,000 troops,” I was referring to the Capitol.\nQ    Oh, I see.  A- — and when does that —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no, you got it wrong.  I was referring —\nQ    When do you plan —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — to the Cap- —\nQ    When do you plan to do that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I offered 10,000 troops to the Capitol before January 6th.\nQ    And as for the 1,500 at the southern border, sir, to clarify, what exactly do you want them to be doing right now?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Making sure that the border is safe and secure and that criminals don’t come into our country.\nQ    Mr. President, do you think that sanctions on Russia will force President Putin to negotiate?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know, but I think he should make a deal.\nQ    Mr. President, does it bother you that Elon Musk criticized a deal that you made publicly, that he said — that he tweeted that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, it doesn’t.  He hates one of the people in the deal.  So —\nQ    Have you spoken to him since then?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  I’ve — well, I’ve spoken Elon but —\nQ    Not about that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’ve spoken to all of them, actually.\nNo, no.  The people in the deal are very, very smart people.  But Elon, one of the people he happens to hate.  But I have certain hatreds of people too —\nQ    Sir —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — you know?\nQ    Sir, on China.  What do you think Xi Jinping can do on the Ukraine-Russia war?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Which one?\nQ    Ukraine-Rus- — -Russia war.  What can Xi Jinping do about that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  China?\nQ    Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They have a lot of power over Russia.  They supply energy to Russia, and Russia supplies energy to them.  They supply other things to — you know, it — it’s really a very big trade.  It’s a very big trading partner.  But Russia supplies a lot of energy to China, China pays them a lot of money for that, and I think they have a lot of power over Russia.  So, I think Russia should want to make a deal.\nMaybe they want to make a deal.  I think, from what I hear, Putin would like to see me, and we’ll meet as soon as we can.  I’d — I’d meet immediately.  Every day we don’t meet, soldiers are being killed in a battlefield, and that battl- — battlefield is like no battlefield since World War II.  That’s a —\nQ    You said that U- — Ukraine wants to —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And I have — I have pictures that you don’t want to see.  Soldiers are being killed on a daily basis at numbers that we haven’t seen in decades.  And it would be nice to end that war.  It’s a ridiculous war.\nQ    You said that Ukraine is ready to make a deal.  Did President Zelenskyy tell you that at — personally?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, sure.  He’s ready to negotiate a deal.  He’d like to stop.  He’s a — he’s somebody that lost a lot of soldiers, and so did Russia — lost a lot.  I mean, Russia lost more soldiers.  They lost 800,000 soldiers.  Would you say that’s a lot?  I’d say it’s a lot.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Mr. President, you said that you wanted to make Dr. King’s dream a reality.  What’s your response to his children and civil rights leaders who say that your DEI orders are a contradiction of his dream and could further drive racial disparities?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I haven’t heard that.\nQ    Mr. President, you put the Houthis back on the terror list.  How do you see the war in Yemen end now?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’ll see what happens, but they can’t shoot down our ships — the Houthis.\nQ    Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And that — you can’t shoot down our ships or any ships, and that’s what they’ve been doing.  So, they’re on the terror list, and —\nQ    Mr. President —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — that’s not good for them.\nQ    Mr. President —\nQ    Sir, why did you revoke security protections for former Secretary of State Mi- — Mike Pompeo and — and Brian Hook?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, the same reason I do — when you, you know, have protection, you can’t have it for the rest of your life.  Do you want to have a large detail of people guarding people for the rest of their lives?  I mean, there’s risks to everything.\nQ    Do you think a former presidents should (inaudible) —\nQ    Sir, would you support striking Iran’s nuclear facilities?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Say it?\nQ    Would you support Israel, for example, striking Iran’s nuclear facilities?  Or do you —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m not going to answer that.\nQ    — believe in diplomacy?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Obviously, I’m not going to answer that question.  We’ll have to see.  I — I’m going to be meeting with various people over the next couple of days, and we’ll see.  But hopefully that can be worked out without having to worry about it.  It would be nice — it would really be nice if that could be worked out without having to go that further step.\nQ    And who are you going to meet with, if I — if I may ask?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’d rather not say that, but very high-level people.  But hopefully that could be worked out.\nYou know, look, Iran, hopefully, will be — make a deal.  And if they don’t make a deal, I guess that’s okay too.\nQ    And, Mr. President, just to follow up, you said you think the Fed should listen to you.  Can you elaborate on why you think it should?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  With regard to interest rates?\nQ    Correct, yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Because I think I know interest rates much better than they do, and I think I know it certainly much better than the one who’s primarily in charge of making that decision.\nBut, no, I’m guided by them very much, but if I disagree, I will let it be known.\nQ    Mr. President —\nQ    Sir, your tariffs planned for China and Mexico are much tougher — or the ones for Canada and Mexico are much tougher than the one for China.  Why is it softer for China?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, China is already paying a lot of tariffs because of me, and when you add them up, I would say, you know, they’re paying a lot.  They paid hundreds of billions of dollars.  They never paid 10 cents until I came along.  When I came along, they pay hundreds of — they’ve paid hundreds of billions of dollars.  Never paid anything.  And so, they’ve already started at a higher base.\nQ    Is February 1st —\nQ    Sir, about the border —\nQ    — the date for Chinese tariffs as well, sir?  February 1?  Or was that just Mexico and Canada?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s Mexico and Canada.  But we’ll — we’re talking about China too.  Look, China is sending us tremendous amounts of bad drugs: fentanyl — really bad stuff.  Most of it comes through Mexico.  And we’re losing, I s- — I think, 300,000 lives a year because of that.  People say 150, 100, 120.  I think 300,000 lives a year.  Those are old numbers.  The other — the lower number is a low number.  And we can’t have that.  They’ve got to stop sending it.\nI had a deal with President Xi, but it was a deal that wasn’t followed up by Biden, of course, where they were going to issue the death penalty to people that make fentanyl, and that would have stopped it.  But we’ll have to stop it with tariffs.\nOkay?  Thank you very much, everybody.\nQ    So, is China (inaudible) —\n(Cross-talk.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nEND                    3:30 P.M.

Today, across science, medicine, and technology, ideological dogmas have surfaced that elevate group identity above individual achievement, enforce conformity at the expense of innovative ideas, and inject politics into the heart of the scientific method.  These agendas have not only distorted truth but have eroded public trust, undermined the integrity of research, stifled innovation, and weakened America’s competitive edge.\nThis order establishes the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to unite the brightest minds from academia, industry, and government to guide our Nation through this critical moment by charting a path forward for American leadership in science and technology.\nSec. 2.  Establishment.  (a)  There is hereby established the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).(b)  The PCAST shall be composed of not more than 24 members.  The Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST) and the Special Advisor for AI & Crypto shall be members of the PCAST.  If also serving as the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the APST may designate the U.S. Chief Technology Officer as a member.  The remaining members shall be distinguished individuals and representatives from sectors outside of the Federal Government appointed by the President.  These non-Federal members shall have diverse perspectives and expertise in science, technology, education, and innovation.(c)  The APST and the Special Advisor for AI & Crypto shall serve as Co-Chairs of the PCAST.  The Co-Chairs may designate up to two Vice Chairs of the PCAST from among the non-Federal members of the PCAST, to support the Co-Chairs in the leadership and organization of the PCAST.\nSec. 3.  Functions.  (a)  The PCAST shall advise the President on matters involving science, technology, education, and innovation policy.  The Council shall also provide the President with scientific and technical information that is needed to inform public policy relating to the American economy, the American worker, national and homeland security, and other topics.(b)  The PCAST shall meet regularly and shall:(i)    respond to requests from the President or the Co-Chairs for information, analysis, evaluation, or advice;(ii)   solicit information and ideas from a broad range of stakeholders, including the research community; the private sector; universities; national laboratories; State, local, and Tribal governments; foundations; and nonprofit organizations;(iii)  serve as the advisory committee identified in section 101(b) of the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-194), as amended (15 U.S.C. 5511(b)), in which capacity the PCAST shall be known as the President’s Innovation and Technology Advisory Committee; and(iv)    serve as the advisory panel identified in section 4 of the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act (Public Law 108-153), as amended (15 U.S.C. 7503), in which capacity the PCAST shall be known as the National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel.(c)  The PCAST shall provide advice from the non-Federal sector to the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) in response to requests from the NSTC.\nSec. 4.  Administration.  (a)  The heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the PCAST with information concerning scientific and technological matters when requested by the PCAST Co-Chairs and as required for the purpose of carrying out the PCAST’s functions.(b)  In consultation with the Co-Chairs, the PCAST is authorized to create standing subcommittees and ad hoc groups, including technical advisory groups, to assist the PCAST and provide preliminary information directly to the PCAST.(c)  In order to allow the PCAST to provide advice and analysis regarding classified matters, the Co-Chairs may request that members of the PCAST, its standing subcommittees, or ad hoc groups who do not hold a current clearance for access to classified information receive security clearance and access determinations pursuant to Executive Order 12968 of August 2, 1995 (Access to Classified Information), as amended, or any successor order.(d)  The Department of Energy shall provide such funding and administrative and technical support as the PCAST may require, to the extent permitted by law and as authorized by existing appropriations.(e)  Members of the PCAST shall serve without any compensation for their work on the PCAST, but may receive travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in the government service (5 U.S.C. 5701–5707).(f)  Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), may apply to the PCAST, any functions of the President under that Act, except that of reporting to the Congress, shall be performed by the Secretary of Energy, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures established by the Administrator of General Services.\nSec. 5.  Termination.  The PCAST shall terminate 2 years from the date of this order unless extended by the President.\nSec. 6.  Revocation.  Executive Order 14007 of January 27, 2021 (President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology), as amended by Executive Order 14109 of September 29, 2023 (Continuance of Certain Federal Advisory Committees and Amendments to Other Executive Orders), is hereby revoked.\nSec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.THE WHITE HOUSE    January 23, 2025."

Ann Wagner, R-MO-2, and 151 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly supports H.R. 21 the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and applauds the House for its efforts to protect the most vulnerable and prevent infanticide.\nCurrent law fails to provide adequate protections, including adequate requirements for the provision of medical care, for vulnerable newborns who survive an abortion attempt. If enacted, H.R. 21 would require any healthcare practitioner who is present at the time that such a child is born to exercise care to preserve the child’s life and health, and to ensure the child is immediately transported and admitted to a hospital. The bill would also require a healthcare practitioner, or hospital employee, to immediately report a violation of these requirements. H.R. 21 would establish a civil right of action for, and prevent criminal prosecution and penalties from being brought against, the mothers of such children.\nAs President Trump established through Executive Order 13952 of September 25, 2020, it is the policy of the United States to recognize the human dignity and inherent worth of every newborn or other infant child, regardless of prematurity or disability, and to ensure for each child due protection under the law.\nA baby that survives an abortion and is born alive into this world should be treated just like any other baby born alive. H.R. 21 would properly amend current law to ensure that the life of one baby is not treated as being more or less valuable than another.\nIf H.R. 21 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend he sign it into law."

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1.  Policy and Purpose.  More than 50 years after the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Federal Government has not released to the public all of its records related to those events.  Their families and the American people deserve transparency and truth.  It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay.\nThe President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 required all records related to the assassination of President Kennedy to be publicly disclosed in full by October 26, 2017, unless the President certifies that:  (i) continued postponement is made necessary by an identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations; and (ii) the identifiable harm is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure.  President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, section 5(g)(2)(D), Public Law 102-526, 106 Stat. 3443, 3448–49, codified at 44 U.S.C. 2107 note.\nI previously accepted proposed redactions from executive departments and agencies (agencies) in 2017 and 2018, but ordered the continued re-evaluation of those remaining redactions.  See Temporary Certification for Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 82 Fed. Reg. 50,307–08 (Oct. 31, 2017); Certification for Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 83 Fed. Reg. 19, 157–58 (Apr. 26, 2018).  In the Presidential Memorandum of April 26, 2018, I also ordered agencies to re-review each of those redactions over the next 3 years and disclose information that no longer warrants continued withholding under the standard set forth in section 5(g)(2)(D) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.\nPresident Biden issued subsequent certifications with respect to these records in 2021, 2022, and 2023, which gave agencies additional time to review the records and withhold information from public disclosure.  See Temporary Certification Regarding Disclosure of Information in Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 86 Fed. Reg. 59,599 (Oct. 22, 2021); Certifications Regarding Disclosure of Information in Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 87 Fed. Reg. 77,967 (Dec. 15, 2022); Certification Regarding Disclosure of Information in Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 88 Fed. Reg. 43,247 (June 30, 2023).\nI have now determined that the continued redaction and withholding of information from records pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is not consistent with the public interest and the release of these records is long overdue.  And although no Act of Congress directs the release of information pertaining to the assassinations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I have determined that the release of all records in the Federal Government’s possession pertaining to each of those assassinations is also in the public interest.\nSec. 2.  Declassification and Disclosure.  (a)  Within 15 days of the date of this order, the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General shall, in coordination with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Counsel to the President, present a plan to the President for the full and complete release of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n(b)  Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General shall, in coordination with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Counsel to the President, review records related to the assassinations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and present a plan to the President for the full and complete release of these records.\nSec. 3.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 23, 2025."

    "content": "REMARKS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM\nVia Teleconference\n11:06 A.M. EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much, Klaus.  And hello to everyone in beautiful Davos.      This has been a truly historic week in the United States.  Three days ago, I took the oath of office, and we began the golden age of America.  The recent presidential election was won by millions of votes and all seven — every one of them — all seven swing states.  It was a massive mandate from the American people like hasn’t been seen in many years.  And some of the political pundits, even some of my so-called enemies, said it was the most consequential election victory in 129 years.  That’s quite nice.      What the world has witnessed in the past 72 hours is nothing less than a revolution of common sense.  Our country will soon be stronger, wealthier, and more united than ever before, and the entire planet will be more peaceful and prosperous as a result of this incredible momentum and what we’re doing and going to do.     My administration is acting with unprecedented speed to fix the disasters we’ve inherited from a totally inept group of people and to solve every single crisis facing our country.      This begins with confronting the economic chaos caused by the failed policies of the last administration.  Over the past four years, our government racked up $8 trillion in wasteful deficit spending and inflicted nation-wrecking energy restrictions, crippling regulations, and hidden taxes like never before.  The result is the worst inflation crisis in modern history and sky-high interest rates for our citizens and even throughout the world.  Food prices and the price of almost every other thing known to mankind went through the roof.      President Biden totally lost control of what was going on in our country but, in particular, with our high-inflation economy and at our border.  Because of these ruinous policies, total government spending this year is $1.5 trillion higher than was projected to occur when I left office just four years ago.  Likewise, the cost of servicing the debt is more than 230 percent higher than was projected in 2020.\nThe inflation rate we are inheriting remains 50 percent higher than the historic target.  It was the highest inflation probably in the history of our country.  That’s why, from the moment I took office, I’ve taken rapid action to reverse each and every one of these radical left policies that created this calamity — in particular, with immigration, crime, and inflation.      On day one, I signed an executive order directing every member of my Cabinet to marshal all powers at their disposal to defeat inflation and reduce the cost of daily life.  I imposed a federal hiring freeze, a federal regulation freeze, a foreign aid freeze, and I created the new Department of Government Efficiency.      I terminated the ridiculous and incredibly wasteful Green New Deal — I call it the “Green New Scam”; withdrew from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord; and ended the insane and costly electric vehicle mandate.  We’re going to let people buy the car they want to buy.      I declared a national em- — energy emergency — and it’s so important — national energy emergency to unlock the liquid gold under our feet and pave the way for rapid approvals of new energy infrastructure.  The United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we’re going to use it.      Not only will this reduce the cost of virtually all goods and services, it will make the United States a manufacturing superpower and the world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto.     My administration has also begun the largest deregulation campaign in history, far exceeding even the record-setting efforts of my last term.      In total, the Biden administration imposed $50,000 in additional regulatory costs on the average American household over the last four years.  I have promised to eliminate 10 old regulations for every new regulation, which will soon put many thousands of dollars back in the pockets of American families.     To further unleash our economy, our majorities in the House and Senate — which we also took, along with the presidency — are going to pass the largest tax cut in American history, including massive tax cuts for workers and family and big tax cuts for domestic producers and manufacturers.  And we’re working with the Democrats on getting an extension of the original Trump tax cuts, as you probably know by just reading any paper.     My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth.  We’re bringing them down very substantially, even from the original Trump tax cuts.  But if you don’t make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff — which will direct hundreds of billions of dollars and even trillions of dollars into our Treasury to strengthen our economy and pay down debt.      Under the Trump administration, there will be no better place on Earth to create jobs, build factories, or grow a company than right here in the good old USA.      Already, American’s economic — and you can see this, I think, maybe even in your — in your wonderful, wonderful room that you’re all gathered together — so many of my friends — but, Americans, the economic confidence is soaring like we haven’t seen in many, many decades, maybe not at all.      Upon my election, it was just announced that small-business optimism skyrocketed by 41 points in a single month.  That’s the highest ever.  There’s never been anything like that.      SoftBank has announced between a $100 and $200 billion investment in the U.S. economy because of the election result.  And just two days ago, Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI announced a $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure.  Other companies, likewise, have announced billions and billions and billions — adding up to trillions — of investment in America, in the United States.      And it’s also reported today in the papers that Saudi Arabia will be investing at least $600 billion in America.  But I’ll be asking the crown prince, who’s a fantastic guy, to round it out to around $1 trillion.  I think they’ll do that because we’ve been very good to them.  And I’m also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil.  You got to bring it down, which, frankly, I’m surprised they didn’t do before the election.  That didn’t show a lot of love by them not doing it.  I was a little surprised by that.      If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately.  Right now, the price is high enough that that war will continue.  You got to bring down the oil price; you’re going to end that war.  They should have done it long ago.  They’re very responsible, actually, to a certain extent, for what’s taking place — millions of lives are being lost.      With oil prices going down, I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately.  And, likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.  Interest rates should follow us.      All over, the progress that you’re seeing is happening because of our historic victory in a recent presidential election, one that has become quite well known throughout the world.\nI think a lot of things are happening to a lot of countries.  They say that there’s light shining all over the world since the election.  And even countries that we aren’t particularly friendly with are happy because they understand what — there is a future and th- — how great the future will be.\nUnder our leadership, America is back and open for business.  And this week, I’m also taking swift action to stop the invasion at our southern border.  They allowed people to come in at levels that nobody has ever seen before.  It was ridiculous.  I decided a — and declared to dec- — to — to do — and very, very importantly — a national emergency on our border; immediately halted all entry of illegal border crossers, of which there were many; and began properly returning the illegal trespassers back to the place from which they came.\nThat action, as you’ve probably seen, has already started very strongly.  I have deployed active-duty U.S. military and National Guard troops to the border to assist in repelling the invasion.  It was really an invasion.  We will not allow our territory to be violated.\nAfter four long years, the United States is strong and sovereign and a beautiful nation once again. It’s a strong, sovereign nation.\nIn addition, I’m pleased to report that America is also a free nation once again.  On day one, I signed an executive order to stop all government censorship.  No longer will our government label the speech of our own citizens as misinformation or disinformation, which are the favorite words of censors and those who wish to stop the free exchange of ideas and, frankly, progress.  We have saved free speech in America, and we’ve saved it strongly.\nWith another historic executive order this week, I also ended the weaponization of law enforcement against the American people — and, frankly, against politicians — and restored the fair, equal, and impartial rule of law.\nMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense — and these are policies that were absolute nonsense — throughout the government and the private sector.  With the recent, yet somewhat unexpected, great Supreme Court decision just made, America will once again become a merit-based country.  You have to hear that word: merit-based country.\nAnd I’ve made it official — an official policy of the United States that there are only two genders, male and female, and we will have no men participating in women’s sports, and transgender operations, which became the rage, will occur very rarely.\nFinally, as we restore common sense in America, we’re moving quickly to bring back strength and peace and stability abroad.  I’m also going to ask all NATO nations to increase defense spending to 5 percent of GDP, which is what it should have been years ago — it was only at 2 percent, and most nations didn’t pay until I came along; I insisted that they pay, and they did — because the United States was really paying the difference at that time, and it’s — it was unfair to the United States.  But many, many things have been unfair for many years to the United States.\nBefore even taking office, my team negotiated a ceasefire agreement in the Middle East, which wouldn’t have happened without us, as I think most of the people in the room know.  Earlier this week, the hostages began to return to their families.  They are returning, and it’s a beautiful sight.  And they’ll be coming in more and more.  They started coming back on Sunday.\nOur efforts to secure a peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine are now, hopefully, underway.  It’s so important to get that done.  That is an absolute killing field.\nMillions of soldiers are being killed.  Nobody has seen anything like it since World War II.  They’re laying dead all over the flat fields.  It’s a flat field — farmland, and there’s millions of Russians and millions of Ukrainians.  Nobody’s seen anything like it since World War II.  It’s time to end it.\nAnd here in America, we have big events coming up.  Next year we have the 250th anniversary of America’s founding.  I’m so honored to be president during that.  That’s been a big event.  They’ve been talking about it for 10 years.  We also have the World Cup, and I understand Gianni — Gianni is in the room — Infantino.  He was very instrumental in helping us get it — he’s there with you someplace, I think — and I want to thank him for that.\nAnd then we have the Olympics coming up, which I was instrumental in getting, also, in my first term.  And who would have known that by skipping a term, I would get the Olympics?  I was upset.  I said, “You know, I got the Olympics to come and I won’t be president.”  But it turned out, through a stroke of luck or whatever you might call it, that I’m going to be president during the World Cup and the Olympics and the 250th\nanniversary.  So, that’s going to be three big events.\nAnd we’ve accomplished more in less than four days — we have really been working — four days — than other administrations have accomplished in four years, and we’re just getting started.  It’s really an amazing thing to see, and the spirit and the light over our country has been incredible.\nUnder the last administration, our nation has suffered greatly, but we are going to bring it back and make it greater, bigger, stronger, better than ever before.\nI want to thank everybody for being with you.  I would have been there myself, except the inauguration was two days ago.  I thought it might be a little bit quick to make it the first stop, but we’ll get there one day.  We hope to get there.\nBut I — I do appreciate — I heard the audience is fantastic, and many of my friends are in the audience.  And I will be taking questions now from some very distinguished people.\nThank you all very much.  (Applause.)\nMR. BRENDE:  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Mr.  President, for that very powerful speech, and I think you could hear the applause all the way from Davos to the White House.  But next year, it will be even better, because then you can get the applause here in Davos.  So, we wish you welcome to our village next year.  We hope to see you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.\nMR. BRENDE:  So, we also know, Mr. President, that you open up for interaction here.  We have a great panel with some of the most distinguished businesspeople in the world.\nLet me start with someone that you know really well, that I think is almost a neighbor of you in Mal-a- — in — in Florida, Mr. Steve Schwarzman, chairman, CEO, and cofounder of Blackstone Group.\nSo, Steve, floor is yours.\nMR. SCHWARZMAN:  Well, Mr. President —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Steve.\nMR. SCHWARZMAN:  — I’m sure the crown prince of Saudi Arabia will be really glad you gave this speech today.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I hope so.\nMR. SCHWARZMAN:  You’ve had the busiest four days that anybody can imagine, and congratulations for that.\nAnd my question is — is about some of the things I’ve observed here at Davos.  It’s a terrific forum.  I’ve met lots of people, as usual.  I think I’ve been here 30 years.  And a lot of the European businesspeople have expressed enormous frustration with the regulatory regime in the EU, and they attribute slower growth rates here because of numerous factors, but especially because of regulations.\nAnd you’ve taken a completely different approach in this area.  And if you could explain the theory of what you’re doing, how you’re going to do it, and what you expect the outcome to be, I’d appreciate it.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  And congratulations, Steve — you’re a friend of mine — but on a great career.  You have had an amazing career and continues.  So, I just want to congratulate you.  Very inspirational to a lot of people.\nI want to talk about the EU, because you mentioned specifically that I’ve also had a lot of friends and leaders of countries.  I’ve gotten to know them all my first term and a little bit during this period of four years and know them well, like them a lot, but they’re very frustrated because of the time everything seems to take to get approved — environmental impact statements for things that you shouldn’t even have to do that, and many, many other ways that it takes.\nAnd I’m going to give you a quick little example.  I w- — in the private life, my beautiful private life — before I had all these things happening — the world is a little different — I had a nice, simple life.  You knew that.\nBut when I had that simple life, I did projects, and I had a big project in Ireland, and it had to get approval on something that would have made it even better.  And I got the approval from Ireland in a period of a week, and it was a very, very, very efficient, good approval.\nAnd they informed me, though, “The problem is you’re going to have to get it from the EU, and we think that’ll take five to six years.”  And I said, “You have to be kidding.”  And this was before politics.  And I said, “Wait a minute.  It’s not that important.  I don’t want to go five or six years.”  But it would have been a big investment.  It would have been nice, and it would have been good for the project.\nAnd I sent the people to the EU to see if they could speed it up, and basically it was a five- or six-year wait just to get a simple approval that Ireland gave me in a period of, literally, not much more than a week.\nAnd I realized right then — that was the first time I really was involved with the EU, but I realized right then, that’s a problem, and I didn’t even bother applying to do it, and — or if I did, I pulled it very quickly.  I don’t wa- — I have to be very accurate, because I don’t want to be criticized.  “He did apply, actually.”  No, I want to be very accurate.  So, I don’t think I did, but if I did, I pulled it very quickly.  It was just something you — you couldn’t wait five years or six years to get an approval.\nSo, a lot of — in a very big business sense, a lot of people are — are claiming that’s the problem.      From the standpoint of America, the EU treats us very, very unfairly, very badly.  They have a large tax that we know about and — a VAT tax — and it’s a very substantial one.  They don’t take our far- — essentially, don’t take our farm products and they don’t take our cars.  Yet, they send cars to us by the millions.\nThey put tariffs on things that we want to do, like, for instance, I think they actually — in terms of these are noneconomic or nonmonetary tariffs, and — and those are very bad, and they make it very difficult to bring products into Europe, and yet they expect to be selling and they do sell their products in the United States.\nSo, we have, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars of deficits with the EU, and nobody is happy with it.  And we’re going to do something about it, but nobody is happy with it.  So, I think the EU has to speed up their process.\nFriends of mine that are in some of the nations within the EU, great people, they — they want to be able to compete better, and you can’t compete when you can’t get — go through the approval process fast.  There’s no reason why it can’t go faster.\nSo, you know, I’m — I’m trying to be constructive, because I love Europe.  I love the countries of Europe.  But the process is a very cumbersome one, and th- — and they do treat the United States of America very, very unfairly with the VAT taxes and all of the other taxes they impose.\nOne other — just to finish up, I got a call from the head of a major airline, one of the biggest airlines in the world.  And he said, “Sir, could you help us?”  “What?” “Landing in Europe is brutal.  They charge us fees for everything, and it’s so unfair.”  I said, “How does it compare to China?”  He said, “It’s — it’s much worse.”\nAnd the other thing, as you know, they took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn’t think was much of a case.  They won $15 or $16 billion from Apple.  They won billions from Google.  I think they’re after Facebook for billions and billions.\nThese are American companies.  Whether you like them or not, they’re — they’re American companies, and they shouldn’t be doing that.  And that’s — as far as I’m concerned, it’s a form of taxation.\nSo, we have some very big complaints with the EU.      Thank you.\nMR. BRENDE:  Tha- — thank you very much, Mr. President.  We’ll now go to one of your friends in the EU, Patrick Pouyanné.  He’s the chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies.      I guess you have a question ready, Patrick, for the president.\nMR. POUYANNÉ:  Mr. President, as we understand, energy is at the top of your agenda, and it’s an honor for me to represent the energy industry tonight in this panel.  TotalEnergies is indeed the fourth largest oil and gas and electricity company in the world.\nI will not ask you a question about the oil price.  It’s quite clear what you expect from us.  I will more go to gas more.  And we, our company, is the largest, number one exporter LNG from the U.S. company.  We are a strong contributor to and we invest in mammoth LNG projects in Texas, $20 billion.  It’s far from $200, but it’s $20 billion.  And we contribute with that to security of supply to Europe as we export this LNG to Europe.\nSome experts fear that if there are too many projects developed in the U.S. on LNG, this could have an inflat- — inflationary impact on the U.S. domestic gas price, and they recommend a pause on these projects.\nI would ask you the following question: What are your views on — about such a pause on investments on LNG in the U.S.?  What would happen if you would observe an increased domestic gas price because of these exports?  And final question, which is important for Europe: Would you agree to guarantee security of supplies of U.S. LNG to Europe?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, on the last part of your question, yes, I would.  I would make sure that you get it.  If we make a deal, we make a deal; you’ll get it.  Because a lot of people do have that problem.  They make a deal, and then it can’t get supplied because of war-type problems and other problems.  So, we would absolutely do that.\nLNG is very interesting, because when I took office for the first term, one of the first things I looked at was two — there were two very massive plants in Louisiana, a state that has been very good to me.  I won it by many, many points, and\nI felt strongly indebted to it, actually.\nAnd they said there are two plants that have been under environmental consideration for more than 10 years, and they were costing — as you say, you know how expensive those plants are — but they were costing like $12 billion and, I think, $14 or $15 billion.  But they couldn’t get their permits.  It was — they were in review for years — many, many years — like a decade or more.\nAnd I said, “So ridiculous.”  I know so much about that, because in the construction industry, I had to go through it too, but I got good at it after a while.\nBut I — I went — I saw the projects, and you’re talking about a total investment of $25 to $30 billion, and it looked like it was going to end.  They couldn’t get their permits, and I got them done in less than a week.  It was done, completed.\nIn fact, when they called them to announce that it was done, the countries — largely countries — Japan was involved and — and another country and some very big investors — they couldn’t believe it.  They actually couldn’t believe it.\nAnd I said, “Just do yourself one favor.  Don’t pay any consultants, because the only one that got it done was me.”  I got it done because it was the right thing to do for the U.S. and for the world, but the consultants had nothing to do with it, you know?  The consultants go in and they say, “Give us millions of dollars because Trump did it.”  Nobody called me about it.  I just heard it was a problem for years, and I got it done because it was the right thing to do for the U.S. and the right thing to do for beyond.  It had to do with energy — very important.\nSo, I think it’s very important.  I think the — the — you know, I disagree with one.  I think the more that you do, the lower the price is going to go.  And what I’d like to see is rapid approvals.\nWe’re going to give very rapid approvals in the United States, like with the AI plants, talking to — many people want to build them.  That’s going to be a very big thing.\nWe’re going to build electric generating facilities — they are going to build.  I’m going to get them the approval.  Under emergency declaration, I can get the approvals done myself without having to go through years of waiting.\nAnd the big problem is we need double the energy we currently have in the United States — can you imagine? — for AI to really be as big as we want to have it.  Because it’s a very competitive — it will be very competitive with China and others.\nSo, I’m going to give emergency declarations so that they can start building them almost immediately.\nAnd I’m — I’m — I think it was largely my idea, because nobody thought this was possible.  It wasn’t that they were not smart, because they’re the smartest, but I told them that what I want you to do is build your electric generating plant right next to your plant as a separate building, connected.  And they said, “Wow, you’re kidding.”  And I said, “No, no.  I’m not kidding.”  You don’t have to hook into the grid, which is old and, you know, could be taken out.  If it’s taken out, they wouldn’t have any way to get any electricity.\nSo, we are going to allow them to go on a very rapid bas- — basis to build their plant — build the electric generating plant.  They can fuel it with anything they want, and they may have coal as a backup.  Good, clean coal.\nYou know, if there were a problem with a — with a pipe coming in — as an example, you’re going with gas — oil or gas — and a pipe gets blown up or, for some reason, doesn’t work, there are some companies in the U.S. that have coal sitting right by the plant so that if there’s an emergency, they can go to that short-term basis and use our very clean coal.\nSo, that’s something else that a lot of people didn’t even know about.  But nothing can destroy coal — not the weather, not a bomb — nothing.  It might make it a little smaller, might make it a little different shape.  But coal is very strong as a backup.  It’s a great backup to have that facility, and it wouldn’t cost much more — more money.\nAnd we have more coal than anybody.  We also have more oil and gas than anybody.\nSo, we’re going to make it so that the plants will have their own electric generating facilities attached right to their plant.  They don’t have to worry about a utility.  They don’t have to worry about anything.  And we’re going to get very rapid approvals.\nMR. BRENDE:  Thank you.  Thank you so much, Mr. President.  We’ll now go to another CEO that you know very well: Brian Moynihan, the CEO and chair of Bank of America.\nMR. MOYNIHAN:  Good afternoon, Mr. President, and congratulations — an obviously eventful week for you and your family.\nIf you remember, five years ago, you came here and we walked among 150 CEOs from all over the world, and you engaged with them about your policies and your procedures.\nThis year, you’re not here.  And yet this week was eventful, from the orders that you mentioned earlier — literally a wave of orders coming out on immigration, on trade, and many other matters.\nAnd so, as a representative of the United States here,\nwe got a lot of questions about what does all this mean and how would the president square this with his clear focus on growth, prosperity, market gro- — stock market growth, a good bond market, and bringing down prices.\nSo, how do you think about the impact of all these orders and how fast they come out and how you’re going to balance them with that scorecard of being successful on both contan- — continuing GDP growth, bringing down inflation, and also having a good stock price appreciation for the American citizen?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it’s going to actually bring down inflation.  It’s going to bring up jobs.  We’re going to have a lot of jobs.  We’re going to have a lot of companies moving in.\nYou know, Brian, we’re at 21 percent.  It was at 40 percent, and I got it down to 21 percent — the corporate tax.  And it was — actually, if you look at state and city, it was, in many cases, much higher than 40 percent.  I got it down to 21 percent.  And now we’re going to bring it down from 21 to 15 percent if — this is a big “if” — if you make your product in the U.S.\nSo, we’re going to have the lowest — just about the lowest rate.  It will be — the 21 is on the low side worldwide; the 15 is about as low as it gets, and by far the lowest of a large country — a large, you know, rich, powerful country — by far, not even a contest.\nSo, we’re going to bring it down to 15 percent if you make your product in the USA.  So, that’s going to create a — a tremendous buzz.\nWe’re also probably going back to the one-year deduction, where we deduct — you know, we — we did that originally, and that was amazing what — the impact that that had, the one-year deduction, which built up over a period of time and then it expires.  But we’re going to go back to that when we do the renewal of the Trump tax plan.\nWe have to get Democrats to approve it.  But, you know, if the Democrats didn’t approve it, I don’t know how they can survive with about a 45 percent tax increase, because that’s what it would be.  And so, I think they’re going to b- — w- — we’ve been working along with them pretty well.\nI think it’s very hard for a political group to say, “Let’s charge people 45 percent more.”  So, I think we’re in good shape.\nBut we’re actually doing a reduction for business and small businesses, where you’re going to b- — bring it down to 15 percent, which is really something.\nAnd, by the way, speaking of you — and you’ve done a fantastic job — but I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives, because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America.  This conserve- — they don’t take conservative business.  And I don’t know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what, but you and Jamie and everybody, I hope you’re going to open your banks to conservatives, because what you’re doing is wrong.\nMR. MOYNIHAN:  Mr. President —     MR. BRENDE:  (Inaudible.)\nMR. MOYNIHAN:  — I’ll say that your friend Gianni was — said hello — told me tell you hello, and we look forward to sponsoring the World Cup when it comes, both this summer for the club and next year.  So, thank you for getting that for the United States.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Brian.\nMR. BRENDE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  We’ll now go to Ana Botín.  She’s the executive chairman of Banco Santander, one of the big European banks and also in the U.S.\nSo, Ana.\nMS. BOTÍN:  Mr. President, congratulations on a historic victory.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nMS. BOTÍN:  I believe you don’t know me as well as my fellow panelists, so a few words.  Santander is one of the largest banks in the world by number of customers, 170 million.  That’s more than my friend Brian or my friend Jamie have.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Wow.\nMS. BOTÍN:  And those — (applause) —\nMR. MOYNIHAN:  If they fix the regulation (inaudible).\nMS. BOTÍN:  That’s coming.  That’s coming.\nMR. BRENDE:  That was cheeky.  (Laughter.)\nMS. BOTÍN:  We are — we are a big investor in the United States.  We have many million customer, 12,000 employees.  We’re one of the largest auto lenders, and we recently launched a fully digital bank called Openbank.\nWe strongly believe banks have a pivotal role in the economy, and we can accelerate growth and help many more customers.  That’s what we do in the United States.  So, as Brian pointed out, we very much welcome your focus on deregulation and reducing bureaucracy.\nSo, my question is: What are your priorities in this regard, and how fast is this going to happen?  Thank you very much.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think it’s going to — thank you and congratulations.  I know very much about your bank, and you’ve done a fantastic job.  Congratulations.\nWe are going to move very quickly.  We’ve moved very quickly.  We’ve done things in the last three days that nobody thought were possible to do in years.  And it’s all taken — it’s all taken effect.  It’s going to have a huge impact on the economy, a huge positive impact.  Money was being wasted on crazy things.\nI mean, the Green New Deal was such a total disgrace — what — what — how that was perpetrated.  And it was conceived of by people that were average students — less than average students, I might add — and never even took a course in energy or the environment.  It was just a game.  Remember, the world was going to end in 12 years?  Remember that?  Well, the 12 years has come and gone.  It was going to end.  It was going to all foam into earth.  But, you know, the time has come.\nThe — these people — and they — they really — they really scared the Democrats large- — I can’t say the Republicans.  Republicans maybe could have fought harder to stop it, but it’s been a tremendous waste of — a tremendous waste of money.\nYou know, during my four years, we had the cleanest air, we had the cleanest water, and yet we had the most productive economy in the history of our country.  We had the most productive economy.  Until COVID came, we had the most productive in the history of our country, by far.\nAnd — and actually, you could look worldwide, we — we’re — we were beating everybody from China to everybody else.  So — and we think we really — now, with what we have learned and all of the other things that have taken place, we think we can even far surpass that — a- — actually, far, far surpass it.  But we do — one thing we’re going to be demanding is we’re going to — be demanding respect from other nations.\nCanada.  We have a tremendous deficit with Canada.  We’re not going to have that anymore.  We can’t do it.  It’s — it’s — I don’t know if it’s good for them.  As you probably know, I say, “You can always become a state, and if you’re a state, we won’t have a deficit.  We won’t have to tariff you, et cetera, et cetera.”\nBut Canada has been very tough to deal with over the years, and it’s not fair that we should have a $200 billion or $250 billion deficit.  We don’t need them to make our cars, and they make a lot of them.  We don’t need their lumber because we have our own forests, et cetera, et cetera.  We don’t need their oil and gas.  We have our — we have more than anybody.\nSo, you know, just as an example, with Mexico — we’re dealing with Mexico, I think, very well.  And we’re just — you know, w- — we just want to be treated fairly with other nations, because there’s hardly a nation in the world — and I blame this on us, and I blame it on politicians that for some reason — and probably mostly it’s stupidity, but you could also say other reasons, but mostly stupidity — they’ve allowed other nations to take advantage of the U.S.  And w- — we can’t allow that to happen anymore.\nYou know, we have debt.  It’s a very small debt when you compare it to value — the value of the assets that we have, but we don’t want to do that.  We want to just have debt be obliterated, and we’ll be able to do that fairly rapidly.  And a lot of good things are going to happen.\nAnd — and honestly, good things are going to happen for the world, and good things are going to happen for the people that are dealing with us — allies and beyond allies.\nOne thing — very important — I really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon and get that war end — ended, and — and that’s not from the standpoint of economy or anything else.  It’s from the standpoint of millions of lives are being wasted.  Beautiful, young people are being shot in the battlefield.  You know, the bullet — a very flat land, as I said, and the bullet goes — there’s no — there’s no hiding.  And a bullet — the only thing going to stop the bullet is a human body.  And you have to see — I’ve seen pictures of what’s taken place.  It’s a carnage.\nAnd we really have to stop that war.  That war is horrible.  And I’m not talking economy, I’m not talking economics, I’m not talking about natural resource.  I’m just talking about: There’s so many young people being killed in this war, and that’s not including the people that have been killed as the cities are being, you know, knocked down building by building.  So, we really should get that stopped.\nLikewise, in the Middle East, I think we’ve made a lot of progress in the Middle East, and I think that’s going to — that’s going to come along pretty well.\nThank you very much.\nMR. BRENDE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  We know that most consequential relationship in the world is between the U.S. and China.  U.S., 28 percent of the global economy; China close to 20.  That’s almost half of the global GDP.\nAnd we know that you called President Xi Jinping last Friday.  We heard that you had a good discussion.\nHow do you see the relationship between the U.S. and China in the next four years under your leadership?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He called me.  But I see it very good.  I think that we’re going to have a very good relationship.  All we want is fairness.  We just want a level playing field.  We don’t want to take advantage.  We’ve been having massive deficits with China.  Biden allowed it to get out of hand.  He’s — $1.1 trillion deficit.  It’s ridiculous, and it’s just an unfair relationship.\nAnd we have to make it just fair.  We don’t have to make it phenomenal.  We have to make it a fair relationship.  Right now, it’s not a fair relationship.  The deficit is massive, as it is with other countries — a lot of Asian countries, actually.  But we have deficits that are very big, and we can’t keep doing that, so we’re not going to keep doing that.\nBut I like President Xi very much.  I’ve always liked him.  We always had a very good relationship.  It was very strained with COVID coming out of Wuhan.  Obviously, that strained it.  I’m sure it strained it with a lot of people, but that strained our relationship.  But we always had a great relationship, I would say, and we look forward to doing very well with China and getting along with China.\nHopefully, China can help us stop the war with, in particular, Russia-Ukraine.  And they have a great deal of power over that situation, and we’ll work with them.\nAnd I mentioned that with — during our phone conversation with President Xi, and hopefully we could work together and get that stopped.\nWe’d like to see denuclearization.  In fact, with President Putin, prior to a — an election result, which was, frankly, ridiculous, we were talking about denuclearization of our two countries, and China would have come along.  China has a — a much smaller, right now, nuclear armament than us or field than us, but they’re — they’re going to be catching it at some point over the next four or five years.\nAnd I will tell you that President Putin really liked the idea of — of cutting way back on nuclear.  And I think the rest of the world, we would have gotten them to follow.  And China would have come along too.  China also liked it.\nTremendous amounts of money are being spent on nuclear, and the destructive capability is something that we don’t even want to talk about today, because you don’t want to hear it.  It’s too depressing.\nSo, we want to see if we can denuclearize, and I think that’s very possible.  And I can tell you that President Putin wanted to do it.  He and I wanted to do it.  We had a good conversation with China.  They would have been involved, and that would have been an unbelievable thing for the planet.\nAnd I hope —\nMR. BRENDE:  Mr. President, when you’re —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — it can be started up again.\nMR. BRENDE:  — back here in Davos next year, will — will there be then a peace agreement with — with Ukraine and Russia by then?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, you’re going to have to ask Russia.  Ukraine is ready to — to make a deal.\nJust so you understand, this is a war that should have never started.  If I were president, it would never have started.  This is a war that should have never, ever been started.  And — and it wasn’t started during my — there was never even talk about it.  I knew that it was the apple of President Putin’s eye, but I also knew that there was no way he was going in, and he wasn’t going to go in.\nAnd then, when I was out, bad things happened, bad things were said, a lot of stupidity all around, and you end up with what you have.  Now you have all these bombed-out cities — they look like demolition sites — with many people killed.\nI think the — the thing that you’ll see about Ukraine is that far — far more people have died than is being reported.  And I’ve seen that.  But far, far more people have died.\nWhen you look at a city that’s become a demolition site, where big buildings have been collapsed by missiles hitting them and everything else, and they say, “One person was slightly injured.”  No, no, many people were killed.  Those are big buildings.  I was surprised at how — that was my business.  These are buildings that go two and three blocks long.  They’re 20 stories high.  They’re big, powerful buildings.  Then they were knocked down, and there were a lot of people in those buildings.  They had announced that two people were injured.  That’s not true.  So, I think you’re going to find that there were many more people killed in Ukraine and the Ukraine war than anybody has any idea.\nBut if you look now, so many of the — the people being killed are soldiers just facing each other with guns, rifles, and drones — the new form of warfare — drones.  And it’s a very sad thing to see.\nAnd when you see pictures of the fields that I see, nobody wants to see it.  You’ll never be the same.\nMR. BRENDE:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  On behalf of all the 3,000 participants here in Davos, we really, really underline that joining us, the third day in your presidency, live, taking questions here, it’s so appreciated.  And we are already ready for receiving you next year in person.\nSo, thank you very much, and all the best from Davos.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND                11:49 A.M.

American households are paying an average of $1,200 more per year in energy costs under President Biden’s policies. Since he took office, total energy costs rose by 36%, gasoline rose 41%, home energy costs rose 30%, electricity bills rose 29%, and gas bills rose 34%.\n\nAfter averaging just $2.77 per gallon under President Trump, and a price of $2.33 upon leaving office, the price of gasoline skyrocketed under President Biden, reaching $3.33 a year later.

Trump.  (Applause.)So, do we want to hear from the 45th and 47th president of the United States?  (Applause.)Take it away, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, JD. This is a hell of a day we’re having, right?  (Applause.)It began very early, and then we decided — you know, we made a good decision, by the way, doing it in the rotunda, as opposed to in about four degrees with the windchill factor.  That would not have been pretty. And, you know, if I made us — did you ever speak in really cold weather?  You can’t.  They would say — the fake news over there, they’d say, “He’s cognitively impaired.  There’s something wrong with him.”  (Laughter.)  So, we didn’t want to give them the chance to do that, did we?We had a — a great time.  We had 72-degree temperature in the rotunda.  We had the people that we needed.  And we had the people that we need tonight, because you guys are unbelievable.  We love you all.  (Applause.)And we said a lot of things today.  I think we got tremendous reviews on the speech.  And, you know, I wanted to put in some really rough stuff, and all of my people, including JD, they said, “You know, let’s not put that paragraph in.”  Oh, I loved that paragraph.  (Laughter.)  There was a paragraph on “Biden shouldn’t be pardoning his family.”  (Applause.)  And we had a couple of others that were far worse than that. But they said, “You know, the speech is so nice and it’s so unifying.”  I said, “All right, we won’t do it.  I’ll do it about two hours later.”  So, we’ve done — (laughter) — we’ve been doing it all night long.But, you know, we’re going to turn this country around and fast.  (Applause.)  We have — we have assets like nobody else.  Number one, we have our people.  That’s our greatest asset, the people of our country.  (Applause.)And I just — and I have a great family.  I really do.  I — I just look around.  My son Eric has been so incredible, married to a woman who became the head of the Republican Party.  I wonder, how the hell did that happen?  (Applause.)  And she’s — she really — her and Michael Whatley, from North Carolina, did a great job.  (Applause.)And then you have — where is my Ivanka?  Have you ever heard of Ivanka and Jared?  (Applause.)And we have — Tiffany is here someplace.  There’s Tiffany.  Have — with — with child, I have to say.  (Applause.)  And Michael.  Thank you very much. And what — look at that group back there.  That’s Kai, our great golfer.  She — a great golfer, that one.  (Applause.)And Don and Don and Chloe.  Chloe — I don’t know, Ivanka, she might be as good as this one.  You have to see her athletic ability.  You wouldn’t believe it.  You look at her, she looks so innocent.  She’s a killer.  (Laughter.)  Chloe is a killer. And we have a great vice president, I want to tell you, and a fantastic — (applause) — and he’s got a fantastic wife and helper, and she’s done — she’s done just incredible things for the party and for him.  And I want to thank you.  Great job.  Great job.  JD Vance, great job.  (Applause.)So — so, we’re going to keep it going.  We’re going to have it turned around quickly.  This big ship, we got to turn it a little bit slower than I’d like, but we’re going to turn it around. We have things that nobody else has.  You know, we — we also have something that — it’s not politically correct to say, but it’s becoming very politically correct: We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation in the world.  (Applause.)  And if you don’t mind, we’re going to use it, right?  (Applause.)And we just left the Commander in Chief Ball, which is, like, a similar size.  Everyone — and we’re going to another one in a little while.  We needed three because we have such support.  There’s a longing for competence in this country.  There’s a longing for common sense in this country. And I was saying before, with a party of common sense, you know, we — we don’t want to have men playing in women’s sports.  (Applause.)  We don’t want to have transgender operations for everyone.  (Applause.)  And we just want to have a great country. Wan- — we want education.  We want houses that don’t cost a fortune.  We want low interest rates.  We want low taxes.  We want a strong, powerful military, and we’re going to have that. We did it once.  We did it in 2017.  We rebuilt our entire military.  It was given away, a lot of it.  Can you believe it? Given away — so foolishly given away, but we’ll have it back again very, very soon.And we’ll be making some announcements.  You’re going to be so thrilled. But we love you all.  We’re going to be — you know, I’d like to say we are a great nation.  We will soon be the greatest we’ve ever been, and that won’t take long. So, I want to thank you all for being here tonight, special people, and we’ll see you soon.  Just watch what happens.  Going to be big progress.  (Applause.)Thank you, everybody.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)(The Village People perform “Y.M.C.A.”)MR.

    "content": "PROTECTING CIVIL RIGHTS AND EXPANDING INDIVIDUAL OPPORTUNITY: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an historic Executive Order that protects the civil rights of all Americans and expands individual opportunity by terminating radical DEI preferencing in federal contracting and directing federal agencies to relentlessly combat private sector discrimination. It enforces long-standing federal statutes and faithfully advances the Constitution’s promise of colorblind equality before the law. This comprehensive order is the most important federal civil rights measure in decades:\n- It terminates “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) discrimination in the federal workforce, and in federal contracting and spending.\n\nFederal hiring, promotions, and performance reviews will reward individual initiative, skills, performance, and hard work and not, under any circumstances, DEI-related factors, goals, policies, mandates, or requirements.\n- Federal hiring, promotions, and performance reviews will reward individual initiative, skills, performance, and hard work and not, under any circumstances, DEI-related factors, goals, policies, mandates, or requirements.\n- The order requires OMB to streamline the federal contracting process to enhance speed and efficiency, reduce costs, and require Federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with our civil rights laws.\n\nIt revokes Executive Order 11246 contracting criteria mandating affirmative action\n\n\n\nIt bars the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs from pushing contractors to balance their workforce based on race, sex, gender identity, sexual preference, or religion.\n\n\n\nIt requires simple and unmistakable affirmation that contractors will not engage in illegal discrimination, including illegal DEI.\n- It revokes Executive Order 11246 contracting criteria mandating affirmative action\n- It bars the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs from pushing contractors to balance their workforce based on race, sex, gender identity, sexual preference, or religion.\n- It requires simple and unmistakable affirmation that contractors will not engage in illegal discrimination, including illegal DEI.\n- It directs all departments and agencies to take strong action to end private sector DEI discrimination, including civil compliance investigations.\n- It mandates the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education issue joint guidance regarding the measures and practices required to comply with the Supreme Court’s decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard.\nRESTORING THE VALUES OF INDIVIDUAL DIGNITY, HARD WORK, AND EXCELLENCE: Individual dignity, hard work, and excellence are fundamental to American greatness. This Executive Order reaffirms these values by ending the Biden-Harris Administration’s anti-constitutional and deeply demeaning “equity” mandates, terminating DEI, and protecting civil rights:\n- Reversing the progress made in the decades since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 toward a colorblind and competence-based workplace, radical DEI has dangerously tainted many of our critical businesses and influential institutions, including the federal government.\n- In the private sector, many corporations and universities use DEI as an excuse for biased and unlawful employment practices and illegal admissions preferences, ignoring the fact that DEI’s foundational rhetoric and ideas foster intergroup hostility and authoritarianism.\n\nBillions of dollars are spent annually on DEI, but rather than reducing bias and promoting inclusion, DEI creates and then amplifies prejudicial hostility and exacerbates interpersonal conflict.\n- Billions of dollars are spent annually on DEI, but rather than reducing bias and promoting inclusion, DEI creates and then amplifies prejudicial hostility and exacerbates interpersonal conflict.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED AND DELIVERED: President Trump promised to terminate DEI in the federal government, protect equal opportunity, and force schools to end discriminatory admissions policies, and he delivered. Every man and woman should have the opportunity to go as far as their hard work, individual initiative, and competence can take them. In America, excellence, grit, and determination is our strength."

Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum terminating a Biden Administration Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) hiring policy that prioritized diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) over safety and efficiency.\n- This Presidential Memorandum orders the Secretary of Transportation and FAA Administrator to immediately stop Biden DEI hiring programs and return to non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring.\n- It also requires the FAA Administrator to review the past performance and performance standards of all FAA employees in critical safety positions and make clear that any individual who fails to demonstrate adequate capability is replaced by someone who will ensure Americans’ flight safety and efficiency.\nMILLIONS OF AMERICANS RELY ON SAFE, TIMELY AIR TRAVEL EVERY DAY: Safety and competence should be the only job criteria for FAA employees, yet the Biden Administration violated the public trust—as well as the law—by prioritizing illegal DEI hiring.\n- Every day, more than 45,000 flights and 2.9 million airline passengers traveling for work or fun or to visit friends and family entrust their lives to the FAA.\n- Almost unbelievably, as a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiative, the Biden FAA specifically recruited and hired individuals with “severe intellectual” disabilities, psychiatric issues, and complete paralysis over other individuals who sought to work for the FAA.\n- President Trump is immediately terminating this illegal and dangerous program and requiring that all FAA hiring be based solely on ensuring the safety of airline passengers and overall job excellence.\n\nOn January 11, 2023, two weeks after a major holiday airline crisis, an FAA system outage caused by employees missteps grounded all flights for the first time since 9/11, an illustration of the importance of FAA competence.\n- On January 11, 2023, two weeks after a major holiday airline crisis, an FAA system outage caused by employees missteps grounded all flights for the first time since 9/11, an illustration of the importance of FAA competence.\nFULFILLING PROMISE TO END ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION AND BRING BACK COMMON SENSE: This Presidential Memorandum builds on President Trump’s day-one Executive Order ending the Biden Administration’s illegal and immoral DEI discrimination programs.\n- In his inaugural address, President Trump promised: ““We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.”\nPresident Trump stated in his January 20, 2025 Executive Order on Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing: “Americans deserve a government committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious taxpayer resources only on making America great.”"

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:Section 1.  Purpose.  Longstanding Federal civil-rights laws protect individual Americans from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  These civil-rights protections serve as a bedrock supporting equality of opportunity for all Americans.  As President, I have a solemn duty to ensure that these laws are enforced for the benefit of all Americans. Yet today, roughly 60 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, critical and influential institutions of American society, including the Federal Government, major corporations, financial institutions, the medical industry, large commercial airlines, law enforcement agencies, and institutions of higher education have adopted and actively use dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) or “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility” (DEIA) that can violate the civil-rights laws of this Nation.Illegal DEI and DEIA policies not only violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system.  Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex.These illegal DEI and DEIA policies also threaten the safety of American men, women, and children across the Nation by diminishing the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination when selecting people for jobs and services in key sectors of American society, including all levels of government, and the medical, aviation, and law-enforcement communities.  Yet in case after tragic case, the American people have witnessed first-hand the disastrous consequences of illegal, pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing.The Federal Government is charged with enforcing our civil-rights laws.  The purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination.Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to protect the civil rights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence, and hard work.  I therefore order all executive departments and agencies (agencies) to terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs, activities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and requirements.  I further order all agencies to enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.Sec. 3.  Terminating Illegal Discrimination in the Federal Government.  (a)  The following executive actions are hereby revoked:(i)    Executive Order 12898 of February 11, 1994 (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations);(ii)   Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011 (Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce);(iii)  Executive Order 13672 of July 21, 2014 (Further Amendments to Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity); and(iv)   The Presidential Memorandum of October 5, 2016 (Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce).(b)  The Federal contracting process shall be streamlined to enhance speed and efficiency, reduce costs, and require Federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with our civil-rights laws.  Accordingly:(i)    Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965 (Equal Employment Opportunity), is hereby revoked.  For 90 days from the date of this order, Federal contractors may continue to comply with the regulatory scheme in effect on January 20, 2025.(ii)   The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs within the Department of Labor shall immediately cease:(A)  Promoting “diversity”;(B)  Holding Federal contractors and subcontractors responsible for taking “affirmative action”; and(C)  Allowing or encouraging Federal contractors and subcontractors to engage in workforce balancing based on race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin.(iii)  In accordance with Executive Order 13279 of December 12, 2002 (Equal Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and Community Organizations), the employment, procurement, and contracting practices of Federal contractors and subcontractors shall not consider race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin in ways that violate the Nation’s civil rights laws.(iv)   The head of each agency shall include in every contract or grant award:(A)  A term requiring the contractual counterparty or grant recipient to agree that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the government’s payment decisions for purposes of section 3729(b)(4) of title 31, United States Code; and(B)  A term requiring such counterparty or recipient to certify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.(c)  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), with the assistance of the Attorney General as requested, shall:(i)    Review and revise, as appropriate, all Government-wide processes, directives, and guidance;(ii)   Excise references to DEI and DEIA principles, under whatever name they may appear, from Federal acquisition, contracting, grants, and financial assistance procedures to streamline those procedures, improve speed and efficiency, lower costs, and comply with civil-rights laws; and(iii)  Terminate all “diversity,” “equity,” “equitable decision-making,” “equitable deployment of financial and technical assistance,” “advancing equity,” and like mandates, requirements, programs, or activities, as appropriate.Sec. 4.  Encouraging the Private Sector to End Illegal DEI Discrimination and Preferences.  (a)  The heads of all agencies, with the assistance of the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action with respect to the operations of their agencies to advance in the private sector the policy of individual initiative, excellence, and hard work identified in section 2 of this order.(b)  To further inform and advise me so that my Administration may formulate appropriate and effective civil-rights policy, the Attorney General, within 120 days of this order, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies and in coordination with the Director of OMB, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy containing recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.  The report shall contain a proposed strategic enforcement plan identifying:(i)    Key sectors of concern within each agency’s jurisdiction;(ii)   The most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners in each sector of concern;(iii)  A plan of specific steps or measures to deter DEI programs or principles (whether specifically denominated “DEI” or otherwise) that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.  As a part of this plan, each agency shall identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars;(iv)   Other strategies to encourage the private sector to end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences and comply with all Federal civil-rights laws;(v)    Litigation that would be potentially appropriate for Federal lawsuits, intervention, or statements of interest; and(vi)   Potential regulatory action and sub-regulatory guidance.Sec. 5.  Other Actions.  Within 120 days of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education shall jointly issue guidance to all State and local educational agencies that receive Federal funds, as well as all institutions of higher education that receive Federal grants or participate in the Federal student loan assistance program under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq., regarding the measures and practices required to comply with Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023).Sec. 6.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.Sec. 7.  Scope.  (a)  This order does not apply to lawful Federal or private-sector employment and contracting preferences for veterans of the U.S. armed forces or persons protected by the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107 et seq.(b)  This order does not prevent State or local governments, Federal contractors, or Federally-funded State and local educational agencies or institutions of higher education from engaging in First Amendment-protected speech.(c)  This order does not prohibit persons teaching at a Federally funded institution of higher education as part of a larger course of academic instruction from advocating for, endorsing, or promoting the unlawful employment or contracting practices prohibited by this order.Sec. 8.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c)  This order is not intended to and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. THE WHITE HOUSE, January 21, 2025.\n"

    "content": "SUBJECT:       Keeping Americans Safe in Aviation\nEvery day, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), within the U.S. Department of Transportation, oversees safety for more than 45,000 flights and 2.9 million airline passengers.  These Americans trust the FAA’s public servants with their lives, and it is therefore imperative that they maintain a commitment to excellence and efficiency. During the prior administration, however, the FAA betrayed its mission by elevating dangerous discrimination over excellence.  For example, prior to my Inauguration, the FAA Diversity and Inclusion website revealed that the prior administration sought to specifically recruit and hire individuals with serious infirmities that could impact the execution of their essential life-saving duties. Illegal and discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) hiring, including on the basis of race, sex, disability, or any other criteria other than the safety of airline passengers and overall job excellence, competency, and qualification, harms all Americans, who deserve to fly with confidence.  It also penalizes hard-working Americans who want to serve in the FAA but are unable to do so, as they lack a requisite disability or skin color.  FAA employees must hold the qualifications and have the ability to perform their jobs to the highest possible standard of excellence. I hereby order the Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administrator to immediately return to non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring, as required by law.  All so-called DEI initiatives, including all dangerous preferencing policies or practices, shall immediately be rescinded in favor of hiring, promoting, and otherwise treating employees on the basis of individual capability, competence, achievement, and dedication.  The Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administrator shall review the past performance and performance standards of all individuals in critical safety positions and take all appropriate action to ensure that any individual who fails or has failed to demonstrate requisite capability is replaced by a high-capability individual that will ensure top-notch air safety and efficiency."

EST      THE VICE PRESIDENT:  How we doing?  (Applause.)  Isn’t it a great day to make the 45th president of the United States the 47th president of the United States?  (Applause.) Just say, first of all, thank you to all of you for your support, for your kindness, for your friendship, for believing enough in this country to fight for it and make Donald J. Trump the president America needs at this moment in time.  (Applause.) We love you, and we’re grateful to you.  And, second, I want to thank the president for his trust that he’s placed in me but, most importantly, for the willingness to sacrifice, to serve, to fight through all — let’s be honest and call it what it is — fight through all of the lies and the bullshit to serve the American people.  (Applause.) So, I want to introduce the 45th and 47th president of the United States.  And we are lucky to have him. God bless you all.  (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much, JD.  And it’s great to have you all.  And, by the way, JD is doing a great job.  You know that.  We picked — we picked the right person.  (Applause.) But I especially want to thank the people in this room.  You know, many of you are donors.  Some of you are large donors.  You believed in us very early.  Some of you believed in us from 2015.  (Applause.)  But you believed in us — there’s a lot of people out there.  And — and 2016 was a great year.  And then we did much better in 2020, much — we got 10 or 12 million more votes.  And I don’t know what happened, but I knew — I said, “We’re doing this again.  We’re going to make it too big to rig.”  And that’s what happened. We had the best numbers anyone has ever seen in the history of the Republican Party, actually.  Got the biggest vote in the history of the Republican Party and I guess in most of the history of the Democrat Party too, because we won in a landslide.  We won the seven swing states, and we won the popular vote.  It’s nice to be popular.  It’s very nice to be popular.  (Applause.)  And we won it — we won it by millions of votes. So, I just want to thank everybody, because this really is a very special room.  And this is the one we chose to come to last.  That’s supposed to be a good thing, and it is a good thing, because we have so many friends in the crowd but, really, friends that supported us. We had a — an incredible day today at the inauguration, and I’ve gotten good reviews on the speech.  You know, they made me take some of the rather difficult things — Melania said to me, “You know, you could do without a couple of those paragraphs.”  (Laughter.)  And we listened, and we listened to some others. We have some tremendous professionals.  Susie Wiles is doing a fantastic job.  (Applause.)  (Inaudible.) And we had great people — great people on the campaign.  The campaign was so beautiful.  That last 120 days, I didn’t sleep one night.  I mean, literally, we just kept going, going, going — no days off, no vacation days.  And we kept hearing the other side was going to take a couple of days off during the week.  I remember there were 14 days, then 17 days, and I heard that our opponent was going to take about 5 days off.  I said, “How do you do that when you’re going for the big one?”  (Laughter.)  But we worked very hard.  And I really think we outworked them, but we also out-thought them.  Work is wonderful, but you have to be able to think.  And now we have the job of bringing our country back because we have the embarrassment of having other countries dumping prisoners and mental institution patients into our country with a stupid open border.  As you know, the border was closed at exactly 1:05 in the afternoon today.  (Applause.)  And I don’t mean closed; I mean really closed.  It’s closed. And we’re going to — we have no choice.  It’s not that I want to do this.  Dwight Eisenhower, a very moderate president, has the record.  He just couldn’t stand when people poured into the country.  He has the record for getting people out that shouldn’t be here.  And, you know, we’re going to far exceed that — not that I want to brag about it, because I hate having to do it.  They should have never done this to our country.  They should have never let this happen.  You know that this is happening with countries all over the world, and you know their crime rates are going down by 10 and 15 and 20 percent every six months?  Venezuela, their crime rate is down by 74.2 percent because they took their street criminals, their prisoners, and their mental patients, and they brought them into the United States of America.  Who the hell can think that’s a good thing?  But we’re getting them out, and we’re strengthening everything we have.  We have something that nobody else has.  We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country in the world.  (Applause.)  And if you don’t mind — now, if you do mind, I will not do it — if you don’t mind, we’re going to use it.  We’re going to use it. And — and through a system of good deals and renegotiating all of these terrible deals — we made some good — really good ones in 2016, but some of the best ones we made were terminated by this Biden administration and gave them back everything they wanted, these other countries, even if they’re allies.  And we have some allies from countries right in this room — big, big people in countries.  So, I hate to embarrass them, but some of our allies are really — they treat us worse than the enemies on trade.  We’re not going to let that happen.  So, we’re going to do things that really started three months ago.  We won the election, and that was a big, big — November 5th, that was a big day.  And I want to make that the most consequential election in the history of our country.  It’s going to be the most consequential. We’re going to turn it around very fast.  It’s a big, big ship, but we’re turning it as fast as a big ship can be turned.  And we’re going to make America great again.  (Applause.) And I just want to thank everybody in — in this large room, because it’s packed.  And the beautiful thing is we have two other rooms that are massive, and you couldn’t get in.  No matter what you did, you couldn’t get in.  And it’s just a great tribute to everybody here and to the people on stage. My family has been so great.  Everyone in this — on this floor. Did — has anybody ever heard of Eric Trump?  (Applause.)  He’s got more subpoenas than anybody in the history of the United States.  (Laughter.)  They were after their political opponent.  How did that work out?  Not so good. They got us a lot of votes.  Can you believe it?  That’s the first time that’s ever happened, actually.  But I just want to thank everybody very much, and I want to thank our first lady.  People love our first lady.  (Applause.)  And she’s done a fantastic job. And we’re going to have a tremendous four years, and hopefully it’s going to go long beyond four years.  We have some tremendous talent, including this guy right here.  Hopefully, it’s going to go long beyond four years.  So, again, I want to thank you for your confidence.  I want to especially thank those people — JD — that were here in 2015 before I really started.  And there’s a lot of them in the room, and they just stuck.  And they said, “We got to do it again, sir.  We got to do it again.”  And we did it again, and we won in record fashion.  So, it was a landslide.  It was a mandate like nobody has had before.  So, thank you all very much.  We love you all.  And we’re going to do a real job for you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, everybody.  (Applause.)                          END                    12:24 A.M.

    "content": "BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\nA PROCLAMATION\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby proclaim:\nAn essential feature of any sovereign nation is the existence of territorial boundaries and the inherent authority to decide who and what may cross those boundaries.  The Supreme Court of the United States has described this power as a “fundamental act of sovereignty,” which “stems not alone from legislative power but is inherent in the executive power to control the foreign affairs of the nation.”  U.S. ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 542 (1950).  The Supreme Court has recognized the inherent right and duty of the Executive Branch to defend our national sovereignty, stating that “[w]hen Congress prescribes a procedure concerning the admissibility of aliens, it is not dealing alone with a legislative power.  It is implementing an inherent executive power.”  Id.\nThe Congress has, in establishing “an uniform Rule of Naturalization,” created a complex and comprehensive Federal scheme in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., to control the entry and exit of people and goods across the borders of the United States.  In routine circumstances, this complex and comprehensive scheme can protect the national sovereignty of the United States by facilitating the admission of individuals whose presence serves the national interest and preventing the admission of those who do not, such as those aliens who pose threats to public health, section 212(a)(1) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(1); safety, section 212(a)(2) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)); and national security, section 212(a)(3) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)).  Prospective immigrants who use the visa system are screened for such health, safety, and security concerns while outside of the United States, and are not permitted to enter the United States until they establish that they are eligible to be admitted as a matter of law and should be admitted as a matter of discretion.\nBut screening under those provisions of the INA can be wholly ineffective in the border environment, where access to necessary information is limited for aliens who have traveled from countries around the world to enter the United States illegally, or when the system is overwhelmed, leading to the unauthorized entry of innumerable illegal aliens into the United States.\nDue to significant information gaps — particularly in the border environment — and processing times, Federal officials do not have the ability to verify with certainty the criminal record or national-security risks associated with the illegal entry of every alien at the southern border, as required by section 212(a)(2)-(3) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)-(3).  Nor do aliens who illegally cross the southern border readily provide comprehensive background information from their home countries to Federal law enforcement officials.\nThe public safety and national security risks in such an environment are heightened by the presence of, and control of territory by, international cartels and other transnational criminal organizations on the other side of the southern border, as well as terrorists and other malign actors who intend to harm the United States and the American people.  And the risks associated with these issues are greatly exacerbated when the number of aliens illegally crossing the southern border increases to levels that prevent actual operational control of the border.\nThe same is true for public health, where the Federal Government currently lacks an effective operational capability to screen all illegal aliens crossing the southern border for communicable diseases of public-health concern, as required by section 212(a)(1) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(1).  Effectively no aliens who illegally enter the United States provide Federal officials at the southern border with their comprehensive health information, as a lawful immigrant would.  As a result, innumerable aliens potentially carrying communicable diseases of public health significance illegally cross the southern border and enter communities across the United States.\nOver the last 4 years, at least 8 million illegal aliens were encountered along the southern border of the United States, and countless millions more evaded detection and illegally entered the United States.  The sheer number of aliens entering the United States has overwhelmed the system and rendered many of the INA’s provisions ineffective, including those previously described that are intended to prevent aliens posing threats to public health, safety, and national security from entering the United States.  As a result, millions of aliens who potentially pose significant threats to health, safety, and national security have moved into communities nationwide.\nThis ongoing influx of illegal aliens across the southern border of the United States has placed significant costs and constraints upon the States, which have collectively spent billions of dollars in providing medical care and related human services, and have spent considerable amounts on increased law enforcement costs associated with the presence of these illegal aliens within their boundaries.\nIn joining the Union, the States agreed to surrender much of their sovereignty and join the Union in exchange for the Federal Government’s promise in Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, to “protect each of [the States] against Invasion.”  I have determined that the current state of the southern border reveals that the Federal Government has failed in fulfilling this obligation to the States and hereby declare that an invasion is ongoing at the southern border, which requires the Federal Government to take measures to fulfill its obligation to the States.\nThe INA provides the President with certain emergency tools.  For example, it states that “[w]henever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.”  8 U.S.C. 1182(f).  This statute “exudes deference to the President in every clause.”  Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 684 (2018).  Further, the INA renders it unlawful for “any alien to depart from or enter or attempt to depart from or enter the United States except under such reasonable rules, regulations, and orders, and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may prescribe.”  8 U.S.C. 1185(a)(1).\nHistorically, Presidents have used these statutory authorities to deny entry of designated classes and categories of aliens into the United States through ports of entry.  But if the President has the power to deny entry of any alien into the United States, and to impose any restrictions as he may deem appropriate, this authority necessarily includes the right to deny the physical entry of aliens into the United States and impose restrictions on access to portions of the immigration system, particularly when the number of aliens illegally crossing the southern border prevents the Federal Government from obtaining operational control of the border.\nThe INA does not, however, occupy the Federal Government’s field of authority to protect the sovereignty of the United States, particularly in times of emergency when entire provisions of the INA are rendered ineffective by operational constraints, such as when there is an ongoing invasion into the States.  The President’s inherent powers to control the borders of the United States, including those deriving from his authority to control the foreign affairs of the United States, necessarily include the ability to prevent the physical entry of aliens involved in an invasion into the United States, and to rapidly repatriate them to an alternative location.  Only through such measures can the President guarantee the right of each State to be protected against invasion.\nBy the power vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, I have determined that the current situation at the southern border qualifies as an invasion under Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution of the United States.  Accordingly, I am issuing this Proclamation based on my express and inherent powers in Article II of the Constitution of the United States, and in faithful execution of the immigration laws passed by the Congress, and suspending the physical entry of aliens involved in an invasion into the United States across the southern border until I determine that the invasion has concluded.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby direct as follows:\nSection 1.  Suspension of Entry.  I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that the entry into the United States on or after the date of this order of aliens engaged in the invasion across the southern border is detrimental to the interests of the United States.  I therefore direct that entry into the United States of such aliens be suspended until I issue a finding that the invasion at the southern border has ceased.\nSec. 2.  Imposition of Restrictions on Entry for Aliens Invading the United States.  I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that aliens engaged in the invasion across the southern border of the United States on or after the date of this proclamation are restricted from invoking provisions of the INA that would permit their continued presence in the United States, including, but not limited to, section 208 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1158, until I issue a finding that the invasion at the southern border has ceased.\nSec. 3.  Suspension of and Restriction on Entry for Aliens Posing Public Health, Safety, or National Security Risks.  I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that the entry into the United States, on or after the date of this order, of any alien who fails, before entering the United States, to provide Federal officials with sufficient medical information and reliable criminal history and background information as to enable fulfillment of the requirements of sections 212(a)(1)-(3) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(1)-(3), is detrimental to the interests of the United States.  I therefore direct that entry into the United States of such aliens be suspended and restrict their access to provisions of the INA that would permit their continued presence in the United States, including, but not limited to, section 208 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1158.\nSec. 4.  Constitutional Suspension of Physical Entry.  Under the authorities provided to me under Article II of the Constitution of the United States, including my control over foreign affairs, and to effectuate the guarantee of protection against invasion required by Article IV, Section 4, I hereby suspend the physical entry of any alien engaged in the invasion across the southern border of the United States, and direct the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, to take appropriate actions as may be necessary to achieve the objectives of this proclamation, until I issue a finding that the invasion at the southern border has ceased.\nSec. 5.  Operational Actions to Repel the Invasion.  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action to repel, repatriate, or remove any alien engaged in the invasion across the southern border of the United States on or after the date of this order, whether as an exercise of the suspension power in section 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), or as an exercise of my delegated authority under the Constitution of the United States, until I issue a finding that the invasion at the southern border has ceased.\nSec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This proclamation shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth."

national interest to promote the extraordinary heritage of our Nation and ensure future generations of American citizens celebrate the legacy of our American heroes.  The naming of our national treasures, including breathtaking natural wonders and historic works of art, should honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic Americans in our Nation’s rich past.\nSec. 2.  Appointments to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.  (a)  Within seven days of the date of this order, each agency head with authority to appoint members to the Board on Geographic Names (Board) pursuant to 43 U.S.C. 364a, shall review their respective appointees and consider replacing those appointees in accordance with applicable law.\n(b)  The Secretary of the Interior shall review and consider additional appointments to the Board to assist in fulfilling all aspects of this order, subject to all applicable laws.\n(c)  With respect to all applications for naming and renaming submitted to the newly constituted Board, the Board shall advance the policy established in section 1 of this order to honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic Americans and may update its principles, policies, and procedures as needed to achieve this policy.\n(d)  Where Congressional action is required to establish a renaming in public law, following Board approval on renaming, the Board shall provide guidance to all relevant Federal agencies to use the Board-approved name in the interim in federal documents and achieve consistency across the federal government.\nSec. 3.  Renaming of Mount McKinley.  (a)  President William McKinley, the 25th President of the United States, heroically led our Nation to victory in the Spanish-American War.  Under his leadership, the United States enjoyed rapid economic growth and prosperity, including an expansion of territorial gains for the Nation.  President McKinley championed tariffs to protect U.S. manufacturing, boost domestic production, and drive U.S. industrialization and global reach to new heights.  He was tragically assassinated in an attack on our Nation’s values and our success, and he should be honored for his steadfast commitment to American greatness.\nIn 1917, the country officially honored President McKinley through the naming of North America’s highest peak.  Yet after nearly a century, President Obama’s administration, in 2015, stripped the McKinley name from federal nomenclature, an affront to President McKinley’s life, his achievements, and his sacrifice.\nThis order honors President McKinley for giving his life for our great Nation and dutifully recognizes his historic legacy of protecting America’s interests and generating enormous wealth for all Americans.\n(b)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, reinstate the name “Mount McKinley.”  The Secretary shall subsequently update the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) to reflect the renaming and reinstatement of Mount McKinley.  The national park area surrounding Mount McKinley shall retain the name Denali National Park and Preserve.\n(c)  The Secretary of the Interior shall work with Alaska Native entities and state and local organizations to adopt names for landmarks to honor the history and culture of the Alaskan people.\nSec. 4.  Gulf of America.  (a)  The area formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico has long been an integral asset to our once burgeoning Nation and has remained an indelible part of America.  The Gulf was a crucial artery for America’s early trade and global commerce.  It is the largest gulf in the world, and the United States coastline along this remarkable body of water spans over 1,700 miles and contains nearly 160 million acres.  Its natural resources and wildlife remain central to America’s economy today.  The bountiful geology of this basin has made it one of the most prodigious oil and gas regions in the world, providing roughly 14% of our Nation’s crude-oil production and an abundance of natural gas, and consistently driving new and innovative technologies that have allowed us to tap into some of the deepest and richest oil reservoirs in the world.  The Gulf is also home to vibrant American fisheries teeming with snapper, shrimp, grouper, stone crab, and other species, and it is recognized as one of the most productive fisheries in the world, with the second largest volume of commercial fishing landings by region in the Nation, contributing millions of dollars to local American economies.  The Gulf is also a favorite destination for American tourism and recreation activities.  Further, the Gulf is a vital region for the multi-billion-dollar U.S. maritime industry, providing some of the largest and most impressive ports in the world.  The Gulf will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping America’s future and the global economy, and in recognition of this flourishing economic resource and its critical importance to our Nation’s economy and its people, I am directing that it officially be renamed the Gulf of America.\n(b)  As such, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, take all appropriate actions to rename as the “Gulf of America” the U.S. Continental Shelf area bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and extending to the seaward boundary with Mexico and Cuba in the area formerly named as the Gulf of Mexico.  The Secretary shall subsequently update the GNIS to reflect the renaming of the Gulf and remove all references to the Gulf of Mexico from the GNIS, consistent with applicable law.  The Board shall provide guidance to ensure all federal references to the Gulf of America, including on agency maps, contracts, and other documents and communications shall reflect its renaming.\nSec. 5.  Additional Action.  The Secretary of Interior may solicit public and intergovernmental input regarding additional patriots to honor, particularly in light of America’s semiquincentennial celebration, and shall recommend action to me, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy.\nSec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025."

and\n(iii)  infiltration into foreign governments across the Western Hemisphere.\nThe Cartels have engaged in a campaign of violence and terror throughout the Western Hemisphere that has not only destabilized countries with significant importance for our national interests but also flooded the United States with deadly drugs, violent criminals, and vicious gangs.\nThe Cartels functionally control, through a campaign of assassination, terror, rape, and brute force nearly all illegal traffic across the southern border of the United States.  In certain portions of Mexico, they function as quasi-governmental entities, controlling nearly all aspects of society.  The Cartels’ activities threaten the safety of the American people, the security of the United States, and the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere.  Their activities, proximity to, and incursions into the physical territory of the United States pose an unacceptable national security risk to the United States.\n(b)  Other transnational organizations, such as Tren de Aragua (TdA) and La Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) pose similar threats to the United States.  Their campaigns of violence and terror in the United States and internationally are extraordinarily violent, vicious, and similarly threaten the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere.\n(c)  The Cartels and other transnational organizations, such as TdA and MS-13, operate both within and outside the United States.  They present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  I hereby declare a national emergency, under IEEPA, to deal with those threats.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to ensure the total elimination of these organizations’ presence in the United States and their ability to threaten the territory, safety, and security of the United States through their extraterritorial command-and-control structures, thereby protecting the American people and the territorial integrity of the United States.\nSec. 3.  Implementation.  (a)  Within 14 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall take all appropriate action, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, to make a recommendation regarding the designation of any cartel or other organization described in section 1 of this order as a Foreign Terrorist Organization consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1189 and/or a Specially Designated Global Terrorist consistent with 50 U.S.C. 1702 and Executive Order 13224.\n(b)  Within 14 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to make operational preparations regarding the implementation of any decision I make to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. 21 et seq., in relation to the existence of any qualifying invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States by a qualifying actor, and to prepare such facilities as necessary to expedite the removal of those who may be designated under this order.\nSec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof;

and\n(vii)  ensure Department and Agency leadership, or their designees, are active participants in implementing the new processes and throughout the full hiring process.\n(c)  This Federal Hiring Plan shall include specific agency plans to improve the allocation of Senior Executive Service positions in the Cabinet agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of Management and Budget, the Small Business Administration, the Social Security Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Office of Personnel Management, and the General Services Administration, to best facilitate democratic leadership, as required by law, within each agency.\n(d)  The Federal Hiring Plan shall provide specific best practices for the human resources function in each agency, which each agency head shall implement, with advice and recommendations as appropriate from DOGE.\nSec. 3.  Accountability and Reporting.  (a)  The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall establish clear performance metrics to evaluate the success of these reforms, and request agency analysis on a regular basis.\n(b)  The Office of Personnel Management shall consult with Federal agencies, labor organizations, and other stakeholders to monitor progress and ensure that the reforms are meeting the needs of both candidates and agencies.\nSec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)    the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof;\n(ii)   the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals;

all “equity action plans,” “equity” actions, initiatives, or programs, “equity-related” grants or contracts; and all DEI or DEIA performance requirements for employees, contractors, or grantees.\n(ii)   provide the Director of the OMB with a list of all:\n(A)  agency or department DEI, DEIA, or “environmental justice” positions, committees, programs, services, activities, budgets, and expenditures in existence on November 4, 2024, and an assessment of whether these positions, committees, programs, services, activities, budgets, and expenditures have been misleadingly relabeled in an attempt to preserve their pre-November 4, 2024 function;\n(B)  Federal contractors who have provided DEI training or DEI training materials to agency or department employees; and\n(C)  Federal grantees who received Federal funding to provide or advance DEI, DEIA, or “environmental justice” programs, services, or activities since January 20, 2021.\n(iii)  direct the deputy agency or department head to:\n(A) assess the operational impact (e.g., the number of new DEI hires) and cost of the prior administration’s DEI, DEIA, and “environmental justice” programs and policies;

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 7301 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women’s domestic abuse shelters to women’s workplace showers.  This is wrong.  Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being.  The erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire American system.  Basing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself.\nThis unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against the ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and scientific terms, replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts.  Invalidating the true and biological category of “woman” improperly transforms laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities into laws and policies that undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept.\nAccordingly, my Administration will defend women’s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male.\nSec. 2.  Policy and Definitions.  It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.  These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.  Under my direction, the Executive Branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality, and the following definitions shall govern all Executive interpretation of and application of Federal law and administration policy:\n(a)  “Sex” shall refer to an individual’s immutable biological classification as either male or female.  “Sex” is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of “gender identity.”\n(b)  “Women” or “woman” and “girls” or “girl” shall mean adult and juvenile human females, respectively.\n(c)  “Men” or “man” and “boys” or “boy” shall mean adult and juvenile human males, respectively.\n(d)  “Female” means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell.\n(e)  “Male” means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.\n(f)  “Gender ideology” replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true.  Gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex.  Gender ideology is internally inconsistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body.\n(g)  “Gender identity” reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an infinite continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex.\nSec. 3.  Recognizing Women Are Biologically Distinct From Men.  (a)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order.\n(b)  Each agency and all Federal employees shall enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes.  Each agency should therefore give the terms “sex”, “male”, “female”, “men”, “women”, “boys” and “girls” the meanings set forth in section 2 of this order when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance and in all other official agency business, documents, and communications.\n(c)  When administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions, every agency and all Federal employees acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall use the term “sex” and not “gender” in all applicable Federal policies and documents.\n(d)  The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, shall implement changes to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder’s sex, as defined under section 2 of this order; and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall ensure that applicable personnel records accurately report Federal employees’ sex, as defined by section 2 of this order.\n(e)  Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages.  Agency forms that require an individual’s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity.  Agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology.\n(f)  The prior Administration argued that the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which addressed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, requires gender identity-based access to single-sex spaces under, for example, Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act.  This position is legally untenable and has harmed women.  The Attorney General shall therefore immediately issue guidance to agencies to correct the misapplication of the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) to sex-based distinctions in agency activities.  In addition, the Attorney General shall issue guidance and assist agencies in protecting sex-based distinctions, which are explicitly permitted under Constitutional and statutory precedent.\n(g)  Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology.  Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.\nSec. 4.  Privacy in Intimate Spaces.  (a)  The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that males are not detained in women’s prisons or housed in women’s detention centers, including through amendment, as necessary, of Part 115.41 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations and interpretation guidance regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n(b)  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall prepare and submit for notice and comment rulemaking a policy to rescind the final rule entitled “Equal Access in Accordance with an Individual’s Gender Identity in Community Planning and Development Programs” of September 21, 2016, 81 FR 64763, and shall submit for public comment a policy protecting women seeking single-sex rape shelters.\n(c)  The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons revises its policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order, and shall ensure that no Federal funds are expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\n(d)  Agencies shall effectuate this policy by taking appropriate action to ensure that intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are designated by sex and not identity.\nSec. 5.  Protecting Rights.  The Attorney General shall issue guidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  In accordance with that guidance, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the General Counsel and Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and each other agency head with enforcement responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act shall prioritize investigations and litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms identified.\nSec. 6.  Bill Text.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs shall present to the President proposed bill text to codify the definitions in this order.\nSec. 7.  Agency Implementation and Reporting.  (a)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, each agency head shall submit an update on implementation of this order to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.  That update shall address:\n(i)   changes to agency documents, including regulations, guidance, forms, and communications, made to comply with this order; and\n(ii)  agency-imposed requirements on federally funded entities, including contractors, to achieve the policy of this order.\n(b)  The requirements of this order supersede conflicting provisions in any previous Executive Orders or Presidential Memoranda, including but not limited to Executive Orders 13988 of January 20, 2021, 14004 of January 25, 2021, 14020 and 14021 of March 8, 2021, and 14075 of June 15, 2022.  These Executive Orders are hereby rescinded, and the White House Gender Policy Council established by Executive Order 14020 is dissolved.\n(c)  Each agency head shall promptly rescind all guidance documents inconsistent with the requirements of this order or the Attorney General’s guidance issued pursuant to this order, or rescind such parts of such documents that are inconsistent in such manner.  Such documents include, but are not limited to:\n(i)    “The White House Toolkit on Transgender Equality”;\n(ii)   the Department of Education’s guidance documents including:\n(A)  “2024 Title IX Regulations: Pointers for Implementation” (July 2024);\n(B)  “U.S. Department of Education Toolkit: Creating Inclusive and Nondiscriminatory School Environments for LGBTQI+ Students”;\n(C)  “U.S. Department of Education Supporting LGBTQI+ Youth and Families in School” (June 21, 2023);\n(D)  “Departamento de Educación de EE.UU.  Apoyar a los jóvenes y familias LGBTQI+ en la escuela” (June 21, 2023);\n(E)  “Supporting Intersex Students: A Resource for Students, Families, and Educators” (October 2021);\n(F)  “Supporting Transgender Youth in School” (June 2021);\n(G)  “Letter to Educators on Title IX’s 49th Anniversary” (June 23, 2021);\n(H)  “Confronting Anti-LGBTQI+ Harassment in Schools: A Resource for Students and Families” (June 2021);\n(I)  “Enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 With Respect to Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of Bostock v.

Clayton County to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972″; and\n(iv)  the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s “Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace” (April 29, 2024).\nSec. 8.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)    the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)   the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(d)  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025."

and\n(ii)  identifying how many nationals from those countries have entered or have been admitted into the United States on or since January 20, 2021, and any other information the Secretaries and Attorney General deem relevant to the actions or activities of such nationals since their admission or entry to the United States.\n(c)  Whenever information is identified that would support the exclusion or removal of any alien described in subsection 2(b), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take immediate steps to exclude or remove that alien unless she determines that doing so would inhibit a significant pending investigation or prosecution of the alien for a serious criminal offense or would be contrary to the national security interests of the United States.\nSec. 3.  Additional Measures to Protect the Nation.  As soon as possible, but no later than 30 days from the date of this order, the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall also:\n(a)  Evaluate and adjust all existing regulations, policies, procedures, and provisions of the Foreign Service Manual, or guidance of any kind pertaining to each of the grounds of inadmissibility listed in sections 212(a)(2)-(3) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)-(3)), to ensure the continued safety and security of the American people and our constitutional republic;\n(b)  Ensure that sufficient safeguards are in place to prevent any refugee or stateless individual from being admitted to the United States without undergoing stringent identification verification beyond that required of any other alien seeking admission or entry to the United States;\n(c)  Evaluate all visa programs to ensure that they are not used by foreign nation-states or other hostile actors to harm the security, economic, political, cultural, or other national interests of the United States;\n(d)  Recommend any actions necessary to protect the American people from the actions of foreign nationals who have undermined or seek to undermine the fundamental constitutional rights of the American people, including, but not limited to, our Citizens’ rights to freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion protected by the First Amendment, who preach or call for sectarian violence, the overthrow or replacement of the culture on which our constitutional Republic stands, or who provide aid, advocacy, or support for foreign terrorists;\n(e)  Ensure the devotion of adequate resources to identify and take appropriate action for offenses described in 8 U.S.C. 1451;\n(f)  Evaluate the adequacy of programs designed to ensure the proper assimilation of lawful immigrants into the United States, and recommend any additional measures to be taken that promote a unified American identity and attachment to the Constitution, laws, and founding principles of the United States;

    "content": "PROTECTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGAINST INVASION\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  Over the last 4 years, the prior administration invited, administered, and oversaw an unprecedented flood of illegal immigration into the United States.  Millions of illegal aliens crossed our borders or were permitted to fly directly into the United States on commercial flights and allowed to settle in American communities, in violation of longstanding Federal laws.\nMany of these aliens unlawfully within the United States present significant threats to national security and public safety, committing vile and heinous acts against innocent Americans.  Others are engaged in hostile activities, including espionage, economic espionage, and preparations for terror-related activities.  Many have abused the generosity of the American people, and their presence in the United States has cost taxpayers billions of dollars at the Federal, State, and local levels.\nEnforcing our Nation’s immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States.  The American people deserve a Federal Government that puts their interests first and a Government that understands its sacred obligation to prioritize the safety, security, and financial and economic well-being of Americans.\nThis order ensures that the Federal Government protects the American people by faithfully executing the immigration laws of the United States.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to faithfully execute the immigration laws against all inadmissible and removable aliens, particularly those aliens who threaten the safety or security of the American people.  Further, it is the policy of the United States to achieve the total and efficient enforcement of those laws, including through lawful incentives and detention capabilities.\nSec. 3.  Faithful Execution of the Immigration Laws.  In furtherance of the policies described in section 2 of this order:\n(a)  Executive Order 13993 of January 20, 2021 (Revision of Civil Immigration Enforcement Policies and Priorities), Executive Order 14010 of February 2, 2021 (Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework To Address the Causes of Migration, To Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, and To Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border), Executive Order 14011 of February 2, 2021 (Establishment of Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families), and Executive Order 14012 of February 2, 2021 (Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans) are hereby revoked;

    "content": "January 20, 2025\nNational Security Presidential Memorandum/NSPM-1\nSUBJECT:       Organization of the National Security Council\nand Subcommittees\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:\nAs President, my highest priority and responsibility is to ensure the safety and security of the United States and its people.  The national and homeland security threats facing the United States are complex and rapidly evolving.  These issues often do not fit neatly into the categories that single departments and agencies are designed to optimally address, a fact recognized and exploited by our strategic competitors and adversaries in their adoption of whole-of-government and even whole-of-society approaches.\nThe United States Government’s decision-making structures and processes to address national security challenges must therefore be equally adaptive and comprehensive.  They must be able to competently design and execute cooperative and integrated interagency solutions to address these problems, and protect and advance the national interests of the United States.  Therefore, to advise and assist me in this endeavor, I hereby direct that my system for national security policy development, decision-making, implementation, and monitoring shall be organized as set forth in this Memorandum.  This Memorandum prevails over any prior orders, directives, memoranda, or other Presidential guidance related to the organization of the National Security Council (NSC or Council).\nA.  The National Security Council and Supporting Staff\n1.  Functions, Responsibilities, and Chairs.\n(a)  Functions and Responsibilities.  The National Security Act of 1947, as amended (the Act), established the NSC to advise the President with respect to the integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to national security.  The Homeland Security Council (HSC) has the distinct purpose of advising the President on matters pertaining to homeland security.  The NSC shall convene as the HSC on topic areas agreed to in advance by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (National Security Advisor) and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security (Homeland Security Advisor).  Along with its subordinate committees and staff, the NSC shall be the President’s principal means for coordinating Executive departments and agencies in the development and implementation of national and homeland security policies, strategies, activities, and functions, their integration across departments and agencies within their purview, and for long-term strategic planning.\n(b)  Chairs.  The President will chair the NSC.  When the President is absent from a meeting of the Council, he may appoint a Cabinet-level official to chair.\n2.  NSC Staffing Responsibilities of the National Security Advisor.\n(a)  Role of the National Security Advisor.  The National Security Advisor shall be responsible, as appropriate and at the President’s direction, for determining the agenda for the NSC, ensuring that the necessary papers are prepared, and recording and communicating Council actions and Presidential decisions in a timely manner.\n(b)  Role of the Homeland Security Advisor.  When convened as the HSC, the duties referenced in subsection (2)(a) shall be the responsibility of the Homeland Security Advisor.\n3.  Designating NSC Members, Attendees, and Invitees.\n(a)  Membership.  The NSC membership consists of the statutory members set forth in section 101(c)(1) of the Act (50 U.S.C. 3021(c)(1)):\n- The Vice President;\n- The Secretary of State;\n- The Secretary of the Treasury;\n- The Secretary of Defense;\n- The Secretary of Energy;\n- The Director of the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy;\nand additional members hereby designated by the President pursuant to section 101(c)(1) of the Act:\n- The Attorney General;\n- The Secretary of the Interior;\nWhen the NSC convenes as the HSC, members shall also include:\n13) The Homeland Security Advisor.\n(b)  NSC Meeting Attendees.  The National Security Advisor retains the discretion to determine the attendee list for all meetings of the NSC, including by requesting the attendance of any senior official of the Executive Branch.  The Homeland Security Advisor retains this same discretion when the NSC convenes as the HSC.  This discretion shall be exercised based on the policy relevance of attendees to the issues being considered, the need for secrecy on sensitive matters, staffing requirements, and other considerations.\nAs regular practice, the National Security Advisor and Homeland Security Advisor shall include as additional non-voting attendees:\n- The Assistant to the President and Principal Deputy National Security Advisor (non-voting advisor and principal notetaker) or, when convening as the HSC, the Deputy Homeland Security Advisor (non-voting advisor and principal notetaker);\n- The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (non-voting advisor); and\n- The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (non-voting advisor).\n(c)  NSC Regular Invitees.  Unless specifically restricted, these officials are invited to attend any NSC and HSC meeting as non-voting advisors:\n- The Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy;\n- The Assistant to the President for Policy; and\n- The Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs and Legal Counsel to the National Security Advisor.\n4.  Right to Propose Agenda Items.\nAny NSC member attending a meeting in a voting capacity may propose, in advance and in accordance with a timeline set by the National Security Advisor or his designee, agenda items for their consideration.[1]  The National Security Advisor will determine whether to include these items on the agenda.  The Homeland Security Advisor shall have this same discretion when the Council is convened as the HSC.\n5.  The National Security Council Staff.\n(a)  Staff Fusion.  There is a single NSC staff within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) that serves both the NSC on national security matters and the HSC when the Council is considering homeland security matters.  The staff is headed by a single Executive Secretary, in accordance with section 101(e)(1) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3021(e)(1)) and section 905 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 495).\n(b)  Purpose.  The purposes of the National Security Advisor and subordinate staff are to\n(i)    advise and assist the President in the course of conducting activities that relate to or affect the carrying out of the President’s constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties pertaining to national or homeland security, pursuant to the Presidential Records Act of 1978, as amended;[2]\n(ii)   advise and assist the other members of the NSC (and the NSC when convening as the HSC), and others in the White House;\n(iii)  help the President plan and set priorities, in accordance with section II of the Message of the President in the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977;\n(iv)   advise and make recommendations to the President with respect to, and establish, integrated domestic, foreign, and military policies and procedures for the departments, agencies, and functions of the Government relating to national and homeland security, pursuant to sections 2 and 101(b)(1) of the Act (50 U.S.C. 3002, 3021(b)(1));\n(v)    coordinate, facilitate, monitor, oversee, and review Administration policies and their implementation with respect to national security, and make resulting recommendations to the President;\n(vi)   help the President resolve major conflicts among departments and agencies with regard to national security, in accordance with section II of the Message of the President in the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977.\n(c)  Fair, Balanced, and Thorough Processes.  In accordance with sections I and II of the Message of the President in the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977, the NSC staff shall ensure that the processes it organizes, coordinates, and manages fairly and thoroughly gather the facts, intelligence, and other relevant information necessary to NSC decisions; fully analyze the issues; consider a full range of views and options; assess the prospects, risks, costs, and implications of each option; and distill these options for the President, other NSC principals, and senior officials participating in the subsidiary committees of the NSC or HSC, in a fair, balanced, and organized way.  The National Security Advisor and subordinate NSC staff shall represent the views and differences of NSC principals and other senior officials to the President with accuracy and fidelity.\n(d)  Policy Development.  In accordance with sections I and II of the Message of the President in the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977,[8] the NSC staff shall facilitate the development and refinement of interagency policy options, and develop additional options besides those proposed by departments and agencies as necessary, both to complement, supplement, and enhance their work, and to offer the President and other NSC principals and other senior officials a sufficiently broad menu of operationally feasible options for consideration, deliberation, and decision.\nB.  The Principals Committee\n1.  Principals Committee Establishment.\n(a)  (i)  Functions and Responsibilities.  The Principals Committee (PC) shall continue to serve as the Cabinet-level senior interagency forum for considering policy issues that affect the national security interests of the United States.  The PC shall develop options and recommendations for the President on national security and homeland security matters requiring the President’s attention, and with the Committee’s full consensus shall set priorities, issue policy guidance, and facilitate coordination and integration on national security policy and implementation issues as appropriate that do not require Presidential attention.[9]  Issues involving matters that are statutorily authorized for decision by a principal, or delegated to a principal by the President, can be coordinated and decided by the principals without requiring Presidential attention.\n(ii)  Voting and NSC Referral.  Consensus is reached when all voting (i.e., non-advisory) attendees present either vote affirmatively for the same decisional option or formally abstain, and all such votes shall be recorded and minuted.  Issues for which the Committee fails to reach consensus shall be referred to the NSC for decision, with a formal nonconcurrence required by at least one non-advisory attendee present for such a referral.  Whether an issue requires Presidential attention, and the Committee attendees’ positions on the issue itself, shall be separately polled.  If a voting attendee does not concur with the determination that Presidential consideration is not required, the issue shall be referred, along with the results of the PC’s deliberation on the issue itself and its recommendations, to deliberation by the NSC.\n(b)  Role of the National Security Advisor.  The PC shall be convened and chaired by the National Security Advisor.  The Chair shall determine the agenda, location, and meeting materials, in consultation with the appropriate attendees.\n(c)  Substitute Chairs.  At his sole discretion, the National Security Advisor may delegate authority to convene and chair or co-chair the PC to an appropriate attendee of the NSC or EOP policy council senior official.  The Homeland Security Advisor, who is Chair when the PC considers matters that would be raised to the NSC convening as the HSC, may similarly delegate such duties.\n(d)  Right to Propose Agenda Items.  Any PC member attending in a voting capacity may propose, in advance and in accordance with a timeline set by the Chair, agenda items for consideration by the PC.  The Chair will determine which, if any, shall be included.\n2.

in these tasks by the senior directors and other NSC staff by the senior directors and other NSC staff.\n(b)  Dispute Resolution Process.  If a PC voting attendee disputes that the conclusions or decisions of the PC were correctly minuted, this must be communicated in writing to the Executive Secretary and the National Security Advisor (and any substitute Chair if appropriate) within three business days, although those officials may allow additional time if exigent or extenuating circumstances require it.  If resolution of the dispute cannot be achieved, and any necessary amended report of the PC proceedings was issued within a week of the dispute being communicated, the disputing attendee may appeal the matter to the White House Chief of Staff or, should that official so designate, to the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, whose decision shall be final.\n3.  Principals Committee Attendees and Invitees.\n(a)  Principals Committee Attendees.\n(i)    The National

regular practice, the National Security Advisor and Homeland Security Advisor shall include as additional non-voting attendees:\n1)  The Director of National Intelligence;\n2)  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff;\n3)  The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency;\n4)  The Principal Deputy National Security Advisor;\n5)  the National Security Advisor to the Vice President; and\n6)  The

to assist the Executive Secretary in the performance of their executive secretary duties.\nC.  The Deputies Committee\n1.  Deputies Committee Establishment.\n(a)  Functions and Responsibilities.  The Deputies Committee (DC) shall continue to serve as the senior sub-Cabinet interagency forum for consideration of and, where appropriate, decision making on, policy issues that affect the national security interests of the United States.  The DC shall review and monitor the work of the interagency national security process, including the interagency groups established pursuant to section D below.  The DC shall work to ensure that issues brought before the NSC, the NSC when convening as the HSC, and the PC have been properly analyzed and prepared for decision.  The DC shall also focus significant attention on monitoring the implementation of these policies and decisions and shall conduct periodic reviews of the Administration’s major national security and foreign policy initiatives.\n(b)  Role of the Principal Deputy National Security Advisor.  The DC shall be convened and chaired by the Principal Deputy National Security Advisor.  The Chair shall determine the

communicated in writing to the Executive Secretary and the Principal Deputy National Security Advisor or the Deputy Homeland Security Advisor, as relevant, within three business days, although those officials may allow additional time if exigent or extenuating circumstances require it.  If resolution of the dispute cannot be achieved, and any necessary amended report of the PC proceedings issued within a week of the dispute being communicated, the disputing attendee may appeal the matter to the White House Chief of Staff, or should that official so designate, the White House Deputy Chief of

ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\nAGENCY\nSUBJECT:                  Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer\nContinental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and\nReview of the Federal Government’s Leasing and\nPermitting Practices for Wind Projects\nSection 1.  Temporary Withdrawal of Areas.  Consistent with the principles of responsible public stewardship that are entrusted to this office, with due consideration for a variety of relevant factors, including the need to foster an energy economy capable of meeting the country’s growing demand for reliable energy, the importance of marine life, impacts on ocean currents and wind patterns, effects on energy costs for Americans –- especially those who can least afford it –- and to ensure that the United States is able to maintain a robust fishing industry for future generations and provide low cost energy to its citizens, I hereby direct as follows:\nUnder the authority granted to me in section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1341(a), I hereby withdraw from disposition for wind energy leasing all areas within the Offshore Continental Shelf (OCS) as defined in section 2 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1331.  This withdrawal shall go into effect beginning on January 21, 2025, and shall remain in effect until this Presidential Memorandum is revoked.\nTo the extent that an area is already withdrawn from disposition for wind energy leasing, the area’s withdrawal is extended for a time period beginning on January 21, 2025, until this Presidential Memorandum is revoked.\nThis withdrawal temporarily prevents consideration of any area in the OCS for any new or renewed wind energy leasing for the purposes of generation of electricity or any other such use derived from the use of wind.  This withdrawal does not apply to leasing related to any other purposes such as, but not limited to, oil, gas, minerals, and environmental conservation.\nNothing in this withdrawal affects rights under existing leases in the withdrawn areas.  With respect to such existing leases, the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Attorney General as needed, shall conduct a comprehensive review of the ecological, economic, and environmental necessity of terminating or amending any existing wind energy leases, identifying any legal bases for such removal, and submit a report with recommendations to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.\nSec. 2.  Temporary Cessation and Immediate Review of Federal Wind Leasing and Permitting Practices.  (a)  In light of various alleged legal deficiencies underlying the Federal Government’s leasing and permitting of onshore and offshore wind projects, the consequences of which may lead to grave harm — including negative impacts on navigational safety interests, transportation interests, national security interests, commercial interests, and marine mammals — and in light of potential inadequacies in various environmental reviews required by the National Environmental Policy Act to lease or permit wind projects, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the heads of all other relevant agencies, shall not issue new or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind projects pending the completion of a comprehensive assessment and review of Federal wind leasing and permitting practices.  The Secretary of the Interior shall lead that assessment and review in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The assessment shall consider the environmental impact of onshore and offshore wind projects upon wildlife, including, but not limited to, birds and marine mammals.  The assessment shall also consider the economic costs associated with the intermittent generation of electricity and the effect of subsidies on the viability of the wind industry.\n(b)  In light of criticism that the Record of Decision (ROD) issued by the Bureau of Land Management on December 5, 2024, with respect to the Lava Ridge Wind Project Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), as approved by the Department of the Interior, is allegedly contrary to the public interest and suffers from legal deficiencies, the Secretary of the Interior shall, as appropriate, place a temporary moratorium on all activities and rights of Magic Valley Energy, LLC, or any other party under the ROD, including, but not limited to, any rights-of-way or rights of development or operation of any projects contemplated in the ROD.  The Secretary of the Interior shall review the ROD and, as appropriate, conduct a new, comprehensive analysis of the various interests implicated by the Lava Ridge Wind Project and the potential environmental impacts.\n(c)  The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall assess the environmental impact and cost to surrounding communities of defunct and idle windmills and deliver a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, with their findings and recommended authorities to require the removal of such windmills.\n(d)  The Attorney General may, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, provide notice of this order to any court with jurisdiction over pending litigation related to any aspect of the Federal leasing or permitting of onshore or offshore wind projects or the Lava Ridge Wind Project, and may, in the Attorney General’s discretion, request that the court stay the litigation or otherwise delay further litigation, or seek other appropriate relief consistent with this order, pending the completion of the actions described in subsection (a) or subsection (b) of this section, as applicable.\nThis memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\nThis memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\n"

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (“NEA”), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  The energy and critical minerals (“energy”) identification, leasing, development, production, transportation, refining, and generation capacity of the United States are all far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs.  We need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation’s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.  Caused by the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration, our Nation’s inadequate energy supply and infrastructure causes and makes worse the high energy prices that devastate Americans, particularly those living on low- and fixed-incomes.\nThis active threat to the American people from high energy prices is exacerbated by our Nation’s diminished capacity to insulate itself from hostile foreign actors.  Energy security is an increasingly crucial theater of global competition.  In an effort to harm the American people, hostile state and non-state foreign actors have targeted our domestic energy infrastructure, weaponized our reliance on foreign energy, and abused their ability to cause dramatic swings within international commodity markets.  An affordable and reliable domestic supply of energy is a fundamental requirement for the national and economic security of any nation.\nThe integrity and expansion of our Nation’s energy infrastructure —- from coast to coast -— is an immediate and pressing priority for the protection of the United States’ national and economic security.  It is imperative that the Federal government puts the physical and economic wellbeing of the American people first.\nMoreover, the United States has the potential to use its unrealized energy resources domestically, and to sell to international allies and partners a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy.  This would create jobs and economic prosperity for Americans forgotten in the present economy, improve the United States’ trade balance, help our country compete with hostile foreign powers, strengthen relations with allies and partners, and support international peace and security.  Accordingly, our Nation’s dangerous energy situation inflicts unnecessary and perilous constraints on our foreign policy.\nThe policies of the previous administration have driven our Nation into a national emergency, where a precariously inadequate and intermittent energy supply, and an increasingly unreliable grid, require swift and decisive action.  Without immediate remedy, this situation will dramatically deteriorate in the near future due to a high demand for energy and natural resources to power the next generation of technology.  The United States’ ability to remain at the forefront of technological innovation depends on a reliable supply of energy and the integrity of our Nation’s electrical grid.  Our Nation’s current inadequate development of domestic energy resources leaves us vulnerable to hostile foreign actors and poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States’ prosperity and national security.\nThese numerous problems are most pronounced in our Nation’s Northeast and West Coast, where dangerous State and local policies jeopardize our Nation’s core national defense and security needs, and devastate the prosperity of not only local residents but the entire United States population.  The United States’ insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation’s economy, national security, and foreign policy.  In light of these findings, I hereby declare a national emergency.\nSec. 2. Emergency Approvals.  (a)  The heads of executive departments and agencies (“agencies”) shall identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them, as well as all other lawful authorities they may possess, to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources, including, but not limited to, on Federal lands.  If an agency assesses that use of either Federal eminent domain authorities or authorities afforded under the Defense Production Act (Public Law 81-774, 50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) are necessary to achieve this objective, the agency shall submit recommendations for a course of action to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.\n(b)  Consistent with 42 U.S.C. 7545(c)(4)(C)(ii)(III), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, after consultation with, and concurrence by, the Secretary of Energy, shall consider issuing emergency fuel waivers to allow the year-round sale of E15 gasoline to meet any projected temporary shortfalls in the supply of gasoline across the Nation.\nSec. 3. Expediting the Delivery of Energy Infrastructure.  (a)   To facilitate the Nation’s energy supply, agencies shall identify and use all relevant lawful emergency and other authorities available to them to expedite the completion of all authorized and appropriated infrastructure, energy, environmental, and natural resources projects that are within the identified authority of each of the Secretaries to perform or to advance.\n(b)  To protect the collective national and economic security of the United States, agencies shall identify and use all lawful emergency or other authorities available to them to facilitate the supply, refining, and transportation of energy in and through the West Coast of the United States, Northeast of the United States, and Alaska.\n(c)  The Secretaries shall provide such reports regarding activities under this section as may be requested by the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.\nSec. 4.  Emergency Regulations and Nationwide Permits Under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Other Statutes Administered by the Army Corps of Engineers.  (a)  Within 30 days from the date of this order, the heads of all agencies, as well as the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works shall:\n(i)   identify planned or potential actions to facilitate the Nation’s energy supply that may be subject to emergency treatment pursuant to the regulations and nationwide permits promulgated by the Corps, or jointly by the Corps and EPA, pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344, section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899, 33 U.S.C. 403, and section 103 of the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1413 (collectively, the “emergency Army Corps permitting provisions”); and\n(ii)  shall provide a summary report, listing such actions, to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”); the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works; the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy; and the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).  Such report may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.\n(b)  Agencies are directed to use, to the fullest extent possible and consistent with applicable law, the emergency Army Corps permitting provisions to facilitate the Nation’s energy supply.\n(c)  Within 30 days following the submission of the initial summary report described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section, each department and agency shall provide a status report to the OMB Director; the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works; the Director of the National Economic Council; and the Chairman of the CEQ. Each such report shall list actions taken within subsection (a)(i) of this section, shall list the status of any previously reported planned or potential actions, and shall list any new planned or potential actions that fall within subsection (a)(i).  Such status reports shall thereafter be provided to these officials at least every 30 days for the duration of the national emergency and may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.\n(d)  The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, shall be available to consult promptly with agencies and to take other prompt and appropriate action concerning the application of the emergency Army Corps permitting provisions.  The Administrator of the EPA shall provide prompt cooperation to the Secretary of the Army and to agencies in connection with the discharge of the responsibilities described in this section.\nSec. 5. Endangered Species Act (ESA) Emergency Consultation Regulations.  (a)  No later than 30 days from the date of this order, the heads of all agencies tasked in this order shall:\n(i)   identify planned or potential actions to facilitate the Nation’s energy supply that may be subject to the regulation on consultations in emergencies, 50 C.F.R. 402.05, promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.; and\n(ii)  provide a summary report, listing such actions, to the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, the OMB Director, the Director of the National Economic Council, and the Chairman of CEQ.  Such report may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.\n(b)  Agencies are directed to use, to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, the ESA regulation on consultations in emergencies, to facilitate the Nation’s energy supply.\n(c)  Within 30 days following the submission of the initial summary report described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section, the head of each agency shall provide a status report to the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, the OMB Director, the Director of the National Economic Council, and the Chairman of CEQ. Each such report shall list actions taken within the categories described in subsection (a)(i) of this section, the status of any previously reported planned or potential actions, and any new planned or potential actions within these categories.  Such status reports shall thereafter be provided to these officials at least every 30 days for the duration of the national emergency and may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.  The OMB Director may grant discretionary exemptions from this reporting requirement.\n(d)  The Secretary of the Interior shall ensure that the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, or the Director’s authorized representative, is available to consult promptly with agencies and to take other prompt and appropriate action concerning the application of the ESA’s emergency regulations.  The Secretary of Commerce shall ensure that the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries for the National Marine Fisheries Service, or the Assistant Administrator’s authorized representative, is available for such consultation and to take such other action.\nSec. 6. Convening the Endangered Species Act Committee.  (a)  In acting as Chairman of the Endangered Species Act Committee, the Secretary of the Interior shall convene the Endangered Species Act Committee not less than quarterly, unless otherwise required by law, to review and consider any lawful applications submitted by an agency, the Governor of a State, or any applicant for a permit or license who submits for exemption from obligations imposed by Section 7 of the ESA.\n(b)  To the extent practicable under the law, the Secretary of the Interior shall ensure a prompt and efficient review of all submissions described in subsection (a) of this section, to include identification of any legal deficiencies, in order to ensure an initial determination within 20 days of receipt and the ability to convene the Endangered Species Act Committee to resolve the submission within 140 days of such initial determination of eligibility.\n(c)  In the event that the committee has no pending applications for review, the committee or its designees shall nonetheless convene to identify obstacles to domestic energy infrastructure specifically deriving from implementation of the ESA or the Marine Mammal Protection Act, to include regulatory reform efforts, species listings, and other related matters with the aim of developing procedural, regulatory, and interagency improvements.\nSec. 7. Coordinated Infrastructure Assistance.  (a)  In collaboration with the Secretaries of Interior and Energy, the Secretary of Defense shall conduct an assessment of the Department of Defense’s ability to acquire and transport the energy, electricity, or fuels needed to protect the homeland and to conduct operations abroad, and, within 60 days, shall submit this assessment to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.  This assessment shall identify specific vulnerabilities, including, but not limited to, potentially insufficient transportation and refining infrastructure across the Nation, with a focus on such vulnerabilities within the Northeast and West Coast regions of the United States.  The assessment shall also identify and recommend the requisite authorities and resources to remedy such vulnerabilities, consistent with applicable law.\n(b)  In accordance with section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), the construction authority provided in section 2808 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, to address any vulnerabilities identified in the assessment mandated by subsection (a).  Any such recommended actions shall be submitted to the President for review, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.\nSec. 8.  Definitions.  For purposes of this order, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)  The term “energy” or “energy resources” means crude oil, natural gas, lease condensates, natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products, uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal heat, the kinetic movement of flowing water, and critical minerals, as defined by 30 U.S.C. 1606 (a)(3).\n(b)  The term “production” means the extraction or creation of energy.\n(c)  The term “transportation” means the physical movement of energy, including through, but not limited to, pipelines.\n(d)  The term “refining” means the physical or chemical change of energy into a form that can be used by consumers or users, including, but not limited to, the creation of gasoline, diesel, ethanol, aviation fuel, or the beneficiation, enrichment, or purification of minerals.\n(e)  The term “generation” means the use of energy to produce electricity or thermal power and the transmission of electricity from its site of generation.\n(f)  The term “energy supply” means the production, transportation, refining, and generation of energy.\nSec. 9.

    "content": "January 20, 2025\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES\nSUBJECT:       Restoring Accountability for Career Senior\nExecutives\nCareer Senior Executive Service (SES) officials are charged to “ensure that the executive management of the Government of the United States is responsive to the needs, policies, and goals of the Nation and otherwise is of the highest quality,” as required by section 3131 of title 5, United States Code.  SES officials have enormous influence over the functioning of the Federal Government, and thus the well-being of hundreds of millions of Americans.\nAs the Constitution makes clear, and as the Supreme Court of the United States has reaffirmed, “the ‘executive Power’ — all of it — is ‘vested in a President,’ who must ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’”  Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 203 (2020).  “Because no single person could fulfill that responsibility alone, the Framers expected that the President would rely on subordinate officers for assistance.”  Id. at 203–04.\nThe President’s power to remove subordinates is a core part of the Executive power vested by Article II of the Constitution and is necessary for the President to perform his duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  Because SES officials wield significant governmental authority, they must serve at the pleasure of the President.\nOnly that chain of responsibility ensures that SES officials are properly accountable to the President and the American people.  If career SES officials fail to faithfully fulfill their duties to advance the needs, policies, and goals of the United States, the President must be able to rectify the situation and ensure that the entire Executive Branch faithfully executes the law.  For instance, SES officials who engage in unauthorized disclosure of Executive Branch deliberations, violate the constitutional rights of Americans, refuse to implement policy priorities, or perform their duties inefficiently or negligently should be held accountable.\nThe President must be able to trust that the Executive Branch will work together in service of the Nation.  My Administration will restore a “government of the people, by the people, for the people.”  Therefore:\n(a)  Within 30 days of the signing of this memorandum, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), shall issue SES Performance Plans that agencies must adopt;\n(b)  Agency heads, who along with their senior staff manage career SES officials as one of their core functions, shall use all available authorities to reinvigorate the SES system and prioritize accountability;\n(c)  Each agency head shall, as necessary and appropriate and consistent with the procedural requirements of section 3395 of title 5, United States Code, reassign agency SES members to ensure their knowledge, skills, abilities, and mission assignments are optimally aligned to implement my agenda;\n(d)  Each agency head should terminate its existing Executive Resources Board (ERB), institute a new or interim ERB, and assign senior noncareer officials to chair and serve on the board as a majority alongside career members;\n(e)  Each agency head should terminate its existing Performance Review Board membership and re-constitute membership with individuals committed to full enforcement of SES performance evaluations that promote and assure an SES of the highest caliber; and\n(f)  Any agency head who becomes aware of an SES official whose performance or continued occupancy of the position is inconsistent with either the principles reaffirmed in this Order or their duties to the Nation under section 3131 of title 5, United States Code, shall immediately take all appropriate actions, up to and including removal of that official, with the support of OPM and OMB.  Restoring an accountable government workforce is a top priority of my Administration."

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  Capital punishment is an essential tool for deterring and punishing those who would commit the most heinous crimes and acts of lethal violence against American citizens.  Before, during, and after the founding of the United States, our cities, States, and country have continuously relied upon capital punishment as the ultimate deterrent and only proper punishment for the vilest crimes.  Our Founders knew well that only capital punishment can bring justice and restore order in response to such evil.  For this and other reasons, capital punishment continues to enjoy broad popular support.\nYet for too long, politicians and judges who oppose capital punishment have defied and subverted the laws of our country.  At every turn, they seek to thwart the execution of lawfully imposed capital sentences and choose to enforce their personal beliefs rather than the law.  When President Biden took office in 2021, he allowed his Department of Justice to issue a moratorium on Federal executions, in defiance of his duty to faithfully execute the laws of the United States that provide for capital punishment.  And on December 23, 2024, President Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 most vile and sadistic rapists, child molesters, and murderers on Federal death row:  remorseless criminals who brutalized young children, strangled and drowned their victims, and hunted strangers for sport.  He commuted their sentences even though the laws of our Nation have always protected victims by applying capital punishment to barbaric acts like theirs.  Judges who oppose capital punishment have likewise disregarded the law by falsely claiming that capital punishment is unconstitutional, even though the Constitution explicitly acknowledges the legality of capital punishment.\nThese efforts to subvert and undermine capital punishment defy the laws of our nation, make a mockery of justice, and insult the victims of these horrible crimes.  The Government’s most solemn responsibility is to protect its citizens from abhorrent acts, and my Administration will not tolerate efforts to stymie and eviscerate the laws that authorize capital punishment against those who commit horrible acts of violence against American citizens.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to ensure that the laws that authorize capital punishment are respected and faithfully implemented, and to counteract the politicians and judges who subvert the law by obstructing and preventing the execution of capital sentences.\nSec. 3.  Federal Capital Punishment.  (a)  The Attorney General shall pursue the death penalty for all crimes of a severity demanding its use.\n(b) In addition to pursuing the death penalty where possible, the Attorney General shall, where consistent with applicable law, pursue Federal jurisdiction and seek the death penalty regardless of other factors for every federal capital crime involving:\n(i)   The murder of a law-enforcement officer; or\n(ii)  A capital crime committed by an alien illegally present in this country.\nThe Attorney General shall encourage State attorneys general and district attorneys to bring State capital charges for all capital crimes with special attention to the crimes described in Subsections (i) and (ii), regardless of whether the federal trial results in a capital sentence.\n(d)  The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to modify the Justice Manual based on the policy and purpose set forth in this Executive Order.\n(e)  The Attorney General shall evaluate the places of imprisonment and conditions of confinement for each of the 37 murderers whose Federal death sentences were commuted by President Biden, and the Attorney General shall take all lawful and appropriate action to ensure that these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose.  The Attorney General shall further evaluate whether these offenders can be charged with State capital crimes and shall recommend appropriate action to state and local authorities.\nSec. 4.  Preserving Capital Punishment in the States.  (a)  The Attorney General shall take all necessary and lawful action to ensure that each state that allows capital punishment has a sufficient supply of drugs needed to carry out lethal injection.\n(b) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to approve or deny any pending request for certification made by any State under 28 U.S.C. 2265.\nSec. 5.  Seeking The Overruling of Supreme Court Precedents That Hinder Capital Punishment.  The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to seek the overruling of Supreme Court precedents that limit the authority of State and Federal governments to impose capital punishment.\nSec. 6.  Prosecuting Crime to Protect Communities.  (a)  The Attorney General shall appropriately prioritize public safety and the prosecution of violent crime, and take all appropriate action necessary to dismantle transnational criminal activity in the United States.\n(b)  To ensure the fullest protection of American communities from violence, the Attorney General shall encourage state attorneys general and district attorneys to adopt policies and practices aligned with subsection (a).  Federal law enforcement should coordinate with State and local law enforcement where possible to facilitate these objectives.\nSec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025."

and\n(g)  Obtaining complete operational control of the borders of the United States.\nSec. 3.  Physical Barriers.  The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to deploy and construct temporary and permanent physical barriers to ensure complete operational control of the southern border of the United States.\nSec. 4.  Deployment of Personnel.  (a)  The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate and lawful action to deploy sufficient personnel along the southern border of the United States to ensure complete operational control; and\n(b)  The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to supplement available personnel to secure the southern border and enforce the immigration laws of the United States through the use of sections 1103(a)(2) and (4)-(6) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(2) and (4)-(6)).\nSec. 5.  Detention.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate actions to detain, to the fullest extent permitted by law, aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law until their successful removal from the United States.  The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, issue new policy guidance or propose regulations regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as “catch-and-release,” whereby illegal aliens are routinely released into the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law.\nSec. 6.  Resumption of Migrant Protection Protocols.  As soon as practicable, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action to resume the Migrant Protection Protocols in all sectors along the southern border of the United States and ensure that, pending removal proceedings, aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came.\nSec. 7.  Adjusting Parole Policies.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law, take all appropriate action to:\n(a)  Cease using the “CBP One” application as a method of paroling or facilitating the entry of otherwise inadmissible aliens into the United States;\n(b)  Terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States established in my Executive Orders, including the program known as the “Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans.”\n(c)  Align all policies and operations at the southern border of the United States to be consistent with the policy of Section 2 of this order and ensure that all future parole determinations fully comply with this order and with applicable law.\nSec. 8.  Additional International Cooperation.  The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall take all appropriate action to facilitate additional international cooperation and agreements, consistent with the policy of Section 2, including entering into agreements based upon the provisions of section 208(a)(2)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1158(a)(2)(A)) or any other applicable provision of law.\nSec. 9.  DNA and Identification Requirements.  (a)  The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to fulfill the requirements of the DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005, title X of Public Law 109-162, for all aliens detained under the authority of the United States; and\n(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to use any available technologies and procedures to determine the validity of any claimed familial relationship between aliens encountered or apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security.\nSec. 10.  Prosecution of Offenses.  The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to prioritize the prosecution of offenses that relate to the borders of the United States, including the investigation and prosecution of offenses that involve human smuggling, human trafficking, child trafficking, and sex trafficking in the United States.\nSec. 11.  Additional Measures.  Within 14 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide recommendations to the President regarding the use of any other authority to protect the United States from foreign threats and secure the southern border.\nSec. 12.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof;

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  The privilege of United States citizenship is a priceless and profound gift.  The Fourteenth Amendment states:  “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”  That provision rightly repudiated the Supreme Court of the United States’s shameful decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857), which misinterpreted the Constitution as permanently excluding people of African descent from eligibility for United States citizenship solely based on their race.\nBut the Fourteenth Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States.  The Fourteenth Amendment has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the United States but not “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.”  Consistent with this understanding, the Congress has further specified through legislation that “a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” is a national and citizen of the United States at birth, 8 U.S.C. 1401, generally mirroring the Fourteenth Amendment’s text.\nAmong the categories of individuals born in the United States and not subject to the jurisdiction thereof, the privilege of United States citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the United States:  (1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited to, visiting the United States under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  (a)  It is the policy of the United States that no department or agency of the United States government shall issue documents recognizing United States citizenship, or accept documents issued by State, local, or other governments or authorities purporting to recognize United States citizenship, to persons:  (1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the person’s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person’s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.\n(b)  Subsection (a) of this section shall apply only to persons who are born within the United States after 30 days from the date of this order.\n(c)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to affect the entitlement of other individuals, including children of lawful permanent residents, to obtain documentation of their United States citizenship.\nSec. 3.  Enforcement.  (a)  The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Commissioner of Social Security shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the regulations and policies of their respective departments and agencies are consistent with this order, and that no officers, employees, or agents of their respective departments and agencies act, or forbear from acting, in any manner inconsistent with this order.\n(b)  The heads of all executive departments and agencies shall issue public guidance within 30 days of the date of this order regarding this order’s implementation with respect to their operations and activities.\nSec. 4.  Definitions.  As used in this order:\n(a)  “Mother” means the immediate female biological progenitor.\n(b)  “Father” means the immediate male biological progenitor.\nSec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025."

Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  Over the last 4 years, the United States has been inundated with record levels of migration, including through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).  Cities and small towns alike, from Charleroi, Pennsylvania, and Springfield, Ohio, to Whitewater, Wisconsin, have seen significant influxes of migrants.  Even major urban centers such as New York City, Chicago, and Denver have sought Federal aid to manage the burden of new arrivals.  Some jurisdictions, like New York and Massachusetts, have even recently declared states of emergency because of increased migration.\nThe United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.  This order suspends the USRAP until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to ensure that public safety and national security are paramount considerations in the administration of the USRAP, and to admit only those refugees who can fully and appropriately assimilate into the United States and to ensure that the United States preserves taxpayer resources for its citizens.  It is also the policy of the United States that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees.\nSec. 3.  Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.  (a)  I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that entry into the United States of refugees under the USRAP would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  I therefore direct that entry into the United States of refugees under the USRAP be suspended — subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (c) of this section — until a finding is made in accordance with section 4 of this order.  This suspension shall take effect at 12:01 am eastern standard time on January 27, 2025.\n(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall suspend decisions on applications for refugee status, until a finding is made in accordance with section 4 of this order.\n(c)  Notwithstanding the suspension of the USRAP imposed pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit aliens to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the entry of such aliens as refugees is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States.\n(d)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.  In all cases, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure that the State and local consultation requirements in 8 U.S.C. 1522(a)(2) are carried out with respect to all refugees admitted to the United States.\nSec. 4.  Resumption of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.  Within 90 days of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit a report to the President through the Homeland Security Advisor regarding whether resumption of entry of refugees into the United States under the USRAP would be in the interests of the United States, in light of the policies outlined in section 2 of this order.  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit further reports every 90 days thereafter until I determine that resumption of the USRAP is in the interests of the United States.\nSec. 5.  Revocation.  Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs To Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration), is hereby revoked.\nSec. 6.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nSec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its

by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles; by terminating, where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable;\n(f)  to safeguard the American people’s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances, including but not limited to lightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, water heaters, toilets, and shower heads, and to promote market competition and innovation within the manufacturing and appliance industries;\n(g)  to ensure that the global effects of a rule, regulation, or action shall, whenever evaluated, be reported separately from its domestic costs and benefits, in order to promote sound regulatory decision making and prioritize the interests of the American people;\n(h)  to guarantee that all executive departments and agencies (agencies) provide opportunity for public comment and rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific analysis; and\n(i)  to ensure that no Federal funding be employed in a manner contrary to the principles outlined in this section, unless required by law.\nSec. 3.  Immediate Review of All Agency Actions that Potentially Burden the Development of Domestic Energy Resources.  (a)  The heads of all agencies shall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and any other agency actions (collectively, agency actions) to identify those agency actions that impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources — with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources — or that are otherwise inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including restrictions on consumer choice of vehicles and appliances.\n(b)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall, in consultation with the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Economic Council (NEC), develop and begin implementing action plans to suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome under subsection (a) of this section, as expeditiously as possible and consistent with applicable law.  The head of any agency who determines that such agency does not have agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section shall submit to the Director of OMB a written statement to that effect and, absent a determination by the Director of OMB that such agency does have agency actions described in this subsection, shall have no further responsibilities under this section.\n(c)  Agencies shall promptly notify the Attorney General of any steps taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section so that the Attorney General may, as appropriate:\n(i)   provide notice of this Executive Order and any such actions to any court with jurisdiction over pending litigation in which such actions may be relevant; and\n(ii)  request that such court stay or otherwise delay further litigation, or seek other appropriate relief consistent with this order, pending the completion of the administrative actions described in this order.\n(d)  Pursuant to the policy outlined in section 2 of this order, the Attorney General shall consider whether pending litigation against illegal, dangerous, or harmful policies should be resolved through stays or other relief.\nSec. 4.  Revocation of and Revisions to Certain Presidential and Regulatory Actions.  (a)  The following are revoked and any offices established therein are abolished:\n(i)     Executive Order 13990 of January 20, 2021 (Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis);\n(ii)    Executive Order 13992 of January 20, 2021 (Revocation of Certain Executive Orders Concerning Federal Regulation);\n(iii)   Executive Order 14008 of January 27, 2021 (Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad);\n(iv)    Executive Order 14007 of January 27, 2021 (President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology);\n(v)     Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration);\n(vi)    Executive Order 14027 of May 7, 2021 (Establishment of the Climate Change Support Office);\n(vii)   Executive Order 14030 of May 20, 2021 (Climate-Related Financial Risk);\n(viii)  Executive Order 14037 of August 5, 2021 (Strengthening American Leadership in Clean Cars and Trucks);\n(ix)    Executive Order 14057 of December 8, 2021 (Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability);\n(x)     Executive Order 14072 of April 22, 2022 (Strengthening the Nation’s Forests, Communities, and Local Economies);\n(xi)    Executive Order 14082 of September 12, 2022 (Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022); and\n(xii)   Executive Order 14096 of April 21, 2023 (Revitalizing Our Nation’s Commitment to Environmental Justice for All).\n(b)  All activities, programs, and operations associated with the American Climate Corps, including actions taken by any agency shall be terminated immediately.  Within one day of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall submit a letter to all parties to the “American Climate Corps Memorandum of Understanding” dated December 2023 to terminate the memorandum, and the head of each party to the memorandum shall agree to the termination in writing.\n(c)  Any assets, funds, or resources allocated to an entity or program abolished by subsection (a) of this section shall be redirected or disposed of in accordance with applicable law.\n(d)  The head of any agency that has taken action respecting offices and programs in subsection (a) shall take all necessary steps to ensure that all such actions are terminated or, if necessary, appropriate, or required by law, that such activities are transitioned to other agencies or entities.\n(e)  Any contract or agreement between the United States and any third party on behalf of the entities or programs abolished in subsection (a) of this section, or in furtherance of them, shall be terminated for convenience, or otherwise, as quickly as permissible under the law.\nSec. 5.  Unleashing Energy Dominance through Efficient Permitting.  (a)  Executive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977 (Relating to protection and enhancement of environmental quality) is hereby revoked.\n(b)  To expedite and simplify the permitting process, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall provide guidance on implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., and propose rescinding CEQ’s NEPA regulations found at 40 CFR 1500 et seq.\n(c)  Following the provision of the guidance, the Chairman of CEQ shall convene a working group to coordinate the revision of agency-level implementing regulations for consistency. The guidance in subsection (b) and any resulting implementing regulations must expedite permitting approvals and meet deadlines established in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118-5).  Consistent with applicable law, all agencies must prioritize efficiency and certainty over any other objectives, including those of activist groups, that do not align with the policy goals set forth in section 2 of this order or that could otherwise add delays and ambiguity to the permitting process.\n(d)  The Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Homeland Security, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies shall undertake all available efforts to eliminate all delays within their respective permitting processes, including through, but not limited to, the use of general permitting and permit by rule.  For any project an agency head deems essential for the Nation’s economy or national security, agencies shall use all possible authorities, including emergency authorities, to expedite the adjudication of Federal permits.  Agencies shall work closely with project sponsors to realize the ultimate construction or development of permitted projects.\n(e)  The Director of the NEC and the Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs shall jointly prepare recommendations to Congress, which shall:\n(i)   facilitate the permitting and construction of interstate energy transportation and other critical energy infrastructure, including, but not limited to, pipelines, particularly in regions of the Nation that have lacked such development in recent years; and\n(ii)  provide greater certainty in the Federal permitting process, including, but not limited to, streamlining the judicial review of the application of NEPA.\nSec. 6.  Prioritizing Accuracy in Environmental Analyses.  (a)  In all Federal permitting adjudications or regulatory processes, all agencies shall adhere to only the relevant legislated requirements for environmental considerations and any considerations beyond these requirements are eliminated.  In fulfilling all such requirements, agencies shall strictly use the most robust methodologies of assessment at their disposal and shall not use methodologies that are arbitrary or ideologically motivated.\n(b) The Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (IWG), which was established pursuant to Executive Order 13990, is hereby disbanded, and any guidance, instruction, recommendation, or document issued by the IWG is withdrawn as no longer representative of governmental policy including:\n(i)    the Presidential Memorandum of January 27, 2021 (Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policymaking);\n(ii)   the Report of the Greenhouse Gas Monitoring and Measurement Interagency Working Group of November 2023 (National Strategy to Advance an Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Information System);\n(iii)  the Technical Support Document of February 2021 (Social Cost of Carbon, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates under Executive Order 13990); and\n(iv)   estimates of the social cost of greenhouse gases, including the estimates for the social cost of carbon, the social cost of methane, or the social cost of nitrous oxide based, in whole or in part, on the IWG’s work or guidance.\n(c)  The calculation of the “social cost of carbon” is marked by logical deficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence of a foundation in legislation.  Its abuse arbitrarily slows regulatory decisions and, by rendering the United States economy internationally uncompetitive, encourages a greater human impact on the environment by affording less efficient foreign energy producers a greater share of the global energy and natural resource market.  Consequently, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA shall issue guidance to address these harmful and detrimental inadequacies, including consideration of eliminating the “social cost of carbon” calculation from any Federal permitting or regulatory decision.\n(d)  Prior to the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, agencies shall ensure estimates to assess the value of changes in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from agency actions, including with respect to the consideration of domestic versus international effects and evaluating appropriate discount rates, are, to the extent permitted by law, consistent with the guidance contained in OMB Circular A-4 of September 17, 2003 (Regulatory Analysis).\n(e)  Furthermore, the head of each agency shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, initiate a process to make such changes to any rule, regulation, policy or action as may be necessary to ensure consistency with the Regulatory Analysis.\n(f)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA, in collaboration with the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit joint recommendations to the Director of OMB on the legality and continuing applicability of the Administrator’s findings, “Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,” Final Rule, 74 FR 66496 (December 15, 2009).\nSec. 7.  Terminating the Green New Deal.  (a)  All agencies shall immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58), including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program, and shall review their processes, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disbursements of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law and the policy outlined in section 2 of this order.  Within 90 days of the date of this order, all agency heads shall submit a report to the Director of the NEC and Director of OMB that details the findings of this review, including recommendations to enhance their alignment with the policy set forth in section 2.  No funds identified in this subsection (a) shall be disbursed by a given agency until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent with any review recommendations they have chosen to adopt.\n(b)  When procuring goods and services, making decisions about leases, and making other arrangements that result in disbursements of Federal funds, agencies shall prioritize cost-effectiveness, American workers and businesses, and the sensible use of taxpayer money, to the greatest extent.  The Director of OMB shall finalize and circulate guidelines to further implement this subsection.\n(c)  All agencies shall assess whether enforcement discretion of authorities and regulations can be utilized to advance the policy outlined in section 2 of this order.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall submit a report to the Director of OMB identifying any such instances.\nSec. 8.  Protecting America’s National Security.(a) The Secretary of Energy is directed restart reviews of applications for approvals of liquified natural gas export projects as expeditiously as possible, consistent with applicable law.  In assessing the “Public Interest” to be advanced by any particular application, the Secretary of Energy shall consider the economic and employment impacts to the United States and the impact to the security of allies and partners that would result from granting the application.\n(b)  With respect to any proposed deepwater port for the export of liquefied natural gas (project) for which a favorable record of decision (ROD) has previously been issued pursuant to the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (DWPA), 33 U.S.C. 1501 et seq., the Administrator of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) shall, within 30 days of the date of this order and consistent with applicable law, determine whether any refinements to the project proposed subsequent to the ROD are likely to result in adverse environmental consequences that substantially differ from those associated with the originally-evaluated project so as to present a seriously different picture of the foreseeable adverse environmental consequences (seriously different consequences).  In making this determination, MARAD shall qualitatively assess any difference in adverse environmental consequences between the project with and without the proposed refinements, including any potential consequences not addressed in the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which shall be considered adequate under NEPA notwithstanding any revisions to NEPA that may have been enacted following the final EIS.  MARAD shall submit this determination, together with a detailed justification, to the Secretary of Transportation and to the President.\n(c)  Pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, if MARAD determines that such refinements are not likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall include in that determination a description of the refinements to supplement and update the ROD, if necessary and then no later than 30 additional days, he shall issue a DWPA license.\n(d)  If MARAD determines, with concurrence from the Secretary of Transportation, that such proposed refinements are likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall, within 60 days after submitting such determination, issue an Environmental Assessment (EA) examining such consequences and, with respect to all other environmental consequences not changed due to project refinements, shall reaffirm the conclusions of the final EIS.  Within 30 days after issuing the EA, MARAD shall issue an addendum to the ROD, if necessary, and shall, within 30 additional days, issue a DWPA license consistent with the ROD.\nSec. 9.  Restoring America’s Mineral Dominance.  (a)  The Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Administrator of the EPA, Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, as appropriate, shall identify all agency actions that impose undue burdens on the domestic mining and processing of non-fuel minerals and undertake steps to revise or rescind such actions.\n(b)  The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture shall reassess any public lands withdrawals for potential revision.\n(c)  The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey’s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.\n(d)  The Secretary of the Interior shall prioritize efforts to accelerate the ongoing, detailed geologic mapping of the United States, with a focus on locating previously unknown deposits of critical minerals.\n(e)  The Secretary of Energy shall ensure that critical mineral projects, including the processing of critical minerals, receive consideration for Federal support, contingent on the availability of appropriated funds.\n(f)  The United States Trade Representative shall assess whether exploitative practices and state-assisted mineral projects abroad are unlawful or unduly burden or restrict United States commerce.\n(g)  The Secretary of Commerce shall assess the national security implications of the Nation’s mineral reliance and the potential for trade action.\n(h)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall assess the quantity and inflow of minerals that are likely the product of forced labor into the United States and whether such inflows pose a threat to national security and, within 90 days of the date of this order, shall provide this assessment to the Director of the NEC.\n(i)  The Secretary of Defense shall consider the needs of the United States in supplying and maintaining the National Defense Stockpile, review the legal authorities and obligations in managing the National Defense Stockpile, and take all appropriate steps to ensure that the National Defense Stockpile will provide a robust supply of critical minerals in event of future shortfall.\n(j)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.\n(k)  The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.\nSec. 10.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025."

DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND\nBUDGET\nTHE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE\nTHE ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR ECONOMIC\nPOLICY\nTHE SENIOR COUNSELOR FOR TRADE AND MANUFACTURING\nSUBJECT:                  America First Trade Policy\nSection 1.  Background.  In 2017, my Administration pursued trade and economic policies that put the American economy, the American worker, and our national security first.  This spurred an American revitalization marked by stable supply chains, massive economic growth, historically low inflation, a substantial increase in real wages and real median household wealth, and a path toward eliminating destructive trade deficits.\nMy Administration treated trade policy as a critical component to national security and reduced our Nation’s dependence on other countries to meet our key security needs.\nAmericans benefit from and deserve an America First trade policy.  Therefore, I am establishing a robust and reinvigorated trade policy that promotes investment and productivity, enhances our Nation’s industrial and technological advantages, defends our economic and national security, and — above all — benefits American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses.\nSec. 2.  Addressing Unfair and Unbalanced Trade.  (a)  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Trade Representative, shall investigate the causes of our country’s large and persistent annual trade deficits in goods, as well as the economic and national security implications and risks resulting from such deficits, and recommend appropriate measures, such as a global supplemental tariff or other policies, to remedy such deficits.\n(b)  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall investigate the feasibility of establishing and recommend the best methods for designing, building, and implementing an External Revenue Service (ERS) to collect tariffs, duties, and other foreign trade-related revenues.\n(c)  The United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, shall undertake a review of, and identify, any unfair trade practices by other countries and recommend appropriate actions to remedy such practices under applicable authorities, including, but not limited to, the Constitution of the United States; sections 71 through 75 of title 15, United States Code; sections 1337, 1338, 2252, 2253, and 2411 of title 19, United States Code; section 1701 of title 50, United States Code; and trade agreement implementing acts.\n(d)  The United States Trade Representative shall commence the public consultation process set out in section 4611(b) of title 19, United States Code, with respect to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in preparation for the July 2026 review of the USMCA.  Additionally, the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies, shall assess the impact of the USMCA on American workers, farmers, ranchers, service providers, and other businesses and make recommendations regarding the United States’ participation in the agreement.  The United States Trade Representative shall also report to appropriate congressional committees on the operation of the USMCA and related matters consistent with section 4611(b) of title 19, United States Code.\n(e)  The Secretary of the Treasury shall review and assess the policies and practices of major United States trading partners with respect to the rate of exchange between their currencies and the United States dollar pursuant to section 4421 of title 19, United States Code, and section 5305 of title 22, United States Code.  The Secretary of the Treasury shall recommend appropriate measures to counter currency manipulation or misalignment that prevents effective balance of payments adjustments or that provides trading partners with an unfair competitive advantage in international trade, and shall identify any countries that he believes should be designated as currency manipulators.\n(f)  The United States Trade Representative shall review existing United States trade agreements and sectoral trade agreements and recommend any revisions that may be necessary or appropriate to achieve or maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to free trade agreement partner countries.\n(g)  The United States Trade Representative shall identify countries with which the United States can negotiate agreements on a bilateral or sector-specific basis to obtain export market access for American workers, farmers, ranchers, service providers, and other businesses and shall make recommendations regarding such potential agreements.\n(h)  The Secretary of Commerce shall review policies and regulations regarding the application of antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws, including with regard to transnational subsidies, cost adjustments, affiliations, and “zeroing.”  Further, the Secretary of Commerce shall review procedures for conducting verifications pursuant to section 1677m of title 19, United States Code, and assess whether these procedures sufficiently induce compliance by foreign respondents and governments involved in AD/CVD proceedings.  The Secretary of Commerce shall consider modifications to these procedures, as appropriate.\n(i)  The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall assess the loss of tariff revenues and the risks from importing counterfeit products and contraband drugs, e.g., fentanyl, that each result from the current implementation of the $800 or less, duty-free de minimis exemption under section 1321 of title 19, United States Code, and shall recommend modifications as warranted to protect both the revenue of the United States and the public health by preventing unlawful importations.\n(j)  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, shall investigate whether any foreign country subjects United States citizens or corporations to discriminatory or extraterritorial taxes pursuant to section 891 of title 26, United States Code.\n(k)  The United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, shall review the impact of all trade agreements — including the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement — on the volume of Federal procurement covered by Executive Order 13788 of April 18, 2017 (Buy American and Hire American), and shall make recommendations to ensure that such agreements are being implemented in a manner that favors domestic workers and manufacturers, not foreign nations.\nSec. 3.  Economic and Trade Relations with the People’s Republic of China (PRC).  (a)  The United States Trade Representative shall review the Economic and Trade Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the People’s Republic of China to determine whether the PRC is acting in accordance with this agreement, and shall recommend appropriate actions to be taken based upon the findings of this review, up to and including the imposition of tariffs or other measures as needed.\n(b)  The United States Trade Representative shall assess the May 14, 2024, report entitled “Four-Year Review of Actions Taken in the Section 301 Investigation:  China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation” and consider potential additional tariff modifications as needed under section 2411 of title 19, United States Code — particularly with respect to industrial supply chains and circumvention through third countries, including an updated estimate of the costs imposed by any unfair trade practices identified in such review — and he shall recommend such actions as are necessary to remediate any issues identified in connection with this process.\n(c)  The United States Trade Representative shall investigate other acts, policies, and practices by the PRC that may be unreasonable or discriminatory and that may burden or restrict United States commerce, and shall make recommendations regarding appropriate responsive actions, including, but not limited to, actions authorized by section 2411 of title 19, United States Code.\n(d)  The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative shall assess legislative proposals regarding Permanent Normal Trade Relations with the PRC and make recommendations regarding any proposed changes to such legislative proposals.\n(e)  The Secretary of Commerce shall assess the status of United States intellectual property rights such as patents, copyrights, and trademarks conferred upon PRC persons, and shall make recommendations to ensure reciprocal and balanced treatment of intellectual property rights with the PRC.\nSec. 4.  Additional Economic Security Matters.  (a)  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall conduct a full economic and security review of the United States’ industrial and manufacturing base to assess whether it is necessary to initiate investigations to adjust imports that threaten the national security of the United States under section 1862 of title 19, United States Code.\n(b)  The Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, shall review and assess the effectiveness of the exclusions, exemptions, and other import adjustment measures on steel and aluminum under section 1862 of title 19, United States Code, in responding to threats to the national security of the United States, and shall make recommendations based upon the findings of this review.\n(c)  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce, in cooperation with the heads of other agencies with export control authorities, shall review the United States export control system and advise on modifications in light of developments involving strategic adversaries or geopolitical rivals as well as all other relevant national security and global considerations.  Specifically, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce shall assess and make recommendations regarding how to maintain, obtain, and enhance our Nation’s technological edge and how to identify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls -– especially those that enable the transfer of strategic goods, software, services, and technology to countries to strategic rivals and their proxies.  In addition, they shall assess and make recommendations regarding export control enforcement policies and practices, and enforcement mechanisms to incentivize compliance by foreign countries, including appropriate trade and national security measures.\n(d)  The Secretary of Commerce shall review and recommend appropriate action with respect to the rulemaking by the Office of Information and Communication Technology and Services (ICTS) on connected vehicles, and shall consider whether controls on ICTS transactions should be expanded to account for additional connected products.\n(e)  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and, as appropriate, the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall review whether Executive Order 14105 of August 9, 2023 (Addressing

Hundreds of thousands of Americans have tragically died from drug overdoses because of the illicit narcotics that have flowed across the southern border.\nThis assault on the American people and the integrity of America’s sovereign borders represents a grave threat to our Nation.\nBecause of the gravity and emergency of this present danger and imminent threat, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to take all appropriate action to assist the Department of Homeland Security in obtaining full operational control of the southern border.\nTo protect the security and safety of United States citizens, to protect each of the States against invasion, and to uphold my duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, it is my responsibility as President to ensure that the illegal entry of aliens into the United States via the southern border be immediately and entirely stopped.\nAs Commander in Chief, I have no more solemn duty than to protect the American people.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), hereby declare that a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States, and that section 12302 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretaries of the military departments concerned, subject to the direction of the Secretary of Defense.  To provide additional authority to the Department of Defense to support the Federal Government’s response to the emergency at the southern border, I hereby declare that this emergency requires use of the Armed Forces and, in accordance with section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), that the construction authority provided in section 2808 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretary of Defense and, at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, to the Secretaries of the military departments.  I hereby direct as follows:\nSection 1.  Deployment of Personnel and Resources.  The Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of each relevant military department, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall order as many units or members of the Armed Forces, including the Ready Reserve and the National Guard, as the Secretary of Defense determines to be appropriate to support the activities of the Secretary of Homeland Security in obtaining complete operational control of the southern border of the United States.  The Secretary of Defense shall further take all appropriate action to facilitate the operational needs of the Secretary of Homeland Security along the southern border, including through the provision of appropriate detention space, transportation (including aircraft), and other logistics services in support of civilian-controlled law enforcement operations.\nSec. 2.  Additional Physical Barriers.  The Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security shall immediately take all appropriate action, consistent with law, including 10 U.S.C. 2214, to construct additional physical barriers along the southern border.  To the extent possible, the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security shall coordinate with any Governor of a State that is willing to assist with the deployment of any physical infrastructure to improve operational security at the southern border.\nSec. 3.  Unmanned Aerial Systems.  The Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Communications Commission shall, consistent with applicable law, consider waiving all applicable Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Communications Commission regulations or policies, respectively, that restrict the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to counter unmanned aerial systems within 5 miles of the southern border.\nSec. 4.  Revision of Policies and Strategies.  The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action, consistent with law, to prioritize the impedance and denial of the unauthorized physical entry of aliens across the southern border of the United States, and to ensure that use of force policies prioritize the safety and security of Department of Homeland Security personnel and of members of the Armed Forces.\nSec. 5.  Revocation.  Proclamation 10142 of January 20, 2021 (Termination of Emergency With Respect to the Southern Border of the United States and Redirection of Funds Diverted to Border Wall Construction), is hereby revoked.\nSec. 6.  Reporting Requirement.  (a)  Within 30 days of the date of this proclamation, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the President, through the Homeland Security Advisor, a report outlining all actions taken to fulfill the requirements and objectives of this proclamation; and\n(b)  Within 90 days of the date of this proclamation, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a joint report to the President about the conditions at the southern border of the United States and any recommendations regarding additional actions that may be necessary to obtain complete operational control of the southern border, including whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807.\nSec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof;

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  In the closing weeks of the 2020 Presidential campaign, at least 51 former intelligence officials coordinated with the Biden campaign to issue a letter discrediting the reporting that President Joseph R. Biden’s son had abandoned his laptop at a computer repair business.  Signatories of the letter falsely suggested that the news story was part of a Russian disinformation campaign.\nBefore being issued, the letter was sent to the CIA Prepublication Classification Review Board, the body typically assigned to formally evaluate the sensitive nature of documents prior to publication.  Senior CIA officials were made aware of the contents of the letter, and multiple signatories held clearances at the time and maintained ongoing contractual relationships with the CIA.\nFederal policymakers must be able to rely on analysis conducted by the Intelligence Community and be confident that it is accurate, crafted with professionalism, and free from politically motivated engineering to affect political outcomes in the United States.  The signatories willfully weaponized the gravitas of the Intelligence Community to manipulate the political process and undermine our democratic institutions.  This fabrication of the imprimatur of the Intelligence Community to suppress information essential to the American people during a Presidential election is an egregious breach of trust reminiscent of a third world country.  And now the faith of Americans in all other patriotic intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect the Nation has been imperiled.\nNational security is also damaged by the publication of classified information.  Former National Security Advisor John R. Bolton published a memoir for monetary gain after he was terminated from his White House position in 2019.  The book was rife with sensitive information drawn from his time in government.  The memoir’s reckless treatment of sensitive information undermined the ability of future presidents to request and obtain candid advice on matters of national security from their staff.  Publication also created a grave risk that classified material was publicly exposed.\nTo remedy these abuses of the public trust, this Order directs the revocation of any active or current security clearances held by:  (i) the former intelligence officials who engaged in misleading and inappropriate political coordination with the 2020 Biden presidential campaign; and (ii) John R. Bolton.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  (a)  It is the policy of the United States to ensure that the Intelligence Community not be engaged in partisan politics or otherwise used by a U.S. political campaign for electioneering purposes.  The term “Intelligence Community” has the meaning given the term in section 3003 of title 50, United States Code.\n(b)  It is the policy of the United States that individuals who hold government-issued security clearances should not use their clearance status to influence U.S. elections.\n(c)  It is the policy of the United States that classified information not be publicly disclosed in memoirs, especially those published for personal monetary gain.\nSec. 3.  Implementation.  (a)  Effective immediately, the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, shall revoke any current or active clearances held by the following individuals:\n(1)  James R. Clapper Jr.\n(2)  Michael V. Hayden\n(3)  Leon E. Panetta\n(4)  John O. Brennan\n(5)  C. Thomas Fingar\n(6)  Richard H. Ledgett Jr.\n(7)  John E. McLaughlin\n(8)  Michael J. Morell\n(9)  Michael G.

Bolton\nTwo signatories, Patty Patricia A. Brandmaeir and Brett Davis, are deceased.\n(b)  Within 90 days of this order, the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, shall submit a report to the President through the National Security Advisor that details:\n(i)    any additional inappropriate activity that occurred within the Intelligence Community, by anyone contracted by the Intelligence Community or by anyone who held a security clearance, related to the letter signed by the 51 former intelligence officials;\n(ii)   recommendations to prevent the Intelligence Community or anyone who works for or within it from inappropriately influencing domestic elections; and\n(iii)  any disciplinary action—including the termination of security clearances—that should be taken against anyone who engaged in inappropriate conduct related to the letter signed by the 51 former intelligence officials.\nSec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,     January 20, 2025."

They are required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the President.  Failure to do so is grounds for dismissal.”\nSec. 4.  Conforming Regulatory Changes.  The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (Director) shall promptly amend the Civil Service Regulations to rescind all changes made by the final rule of April 9, 2024, “Upholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles,” 89 Fed. Reg. 24982, that impede the purposes of or would otherwise affect the implementation of Executive Order 13957.  Until such rescissions are effectuated (including the resolution of any judicial review), 5 CFR part 302, subpart F, 5 CFR 210.102(b)(3), and 5 CFR 210.102(b)(4) shall be held inoperative and without effect.\nSec. 5.  Additional Positions for Consideration.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director shall, after consultation with the Executive Office of the President, issue guidance about additional categories of positions that executive departments and agencies should consider recommending for Schedule Policy/Career.\nSec. 6.  Revocation.  Executive Order 14003 of January 22, 2021 (Protecting the Federal Workforce), is hereby revoked, and any rules, regulations, guidance, or other agency policies effectuated under Executive Order 14003 shall not be enforced.  The heads of each executive department and agency shall review and identify existing agency actions relating to or arising under section 3(e)(v) and 3(f) of Executive Order 14003 (relating to suspending, revising, or rescinding revisions to discipline and unacceptable performance policies) and, as soon as practicable, suspend, revise, or rescind such actions identified in the review.\nSec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025."

    "content": "APPLICATION OF PROTECTING AMERICANS FROM FOREIGN ADVERSARY CONTROLLED APPLICATIONS ACT TO TIKTOK\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Policy.  The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (the “Act”) (Pub. L. 118-50, div. H) regulates “foreign adversary controlled applications,” specifically those operated by TikTok and any other subsidiary of its China-based parent company, ByteDance Ltd., on national security grounds.\nSection 2(a) of the Act prohibits entities from distributing, maintaining, or updating certain defined foreign adversary controlled applications within the territory of the United States by providing (A) services for such distribution, maintenance, or updates by means of an online mobile application store or other marketplace; or (B) internet hosting services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of such applications.  Section 2(g) of the Act defines “Foreign Adversary Controlled Application” to include websites, desktop applications, mobile applications, and augmented or immersive technology applications operated directly or indirectly by ByteDance Ltd. or TikTok.  Under section 2(a) of the Act, the prohibitions of the Act with respect to these entities became effective on January 19, 2025.\nI have the unique constitutional responsibility for the national security of the United States, the conduct of foreign policy, and other vital executive functions.  To fulfill those responsibilities, I intend to consult with my advisors, including the heads of relevant departments and agencies on the national security concerns posed by TikTok, and to pursue a resolution that protects national security while saving a platform used by 170 million Americans.  My Administration must also review sensitive intelligence related to those concerns and evaluate the sufficiency of mitigation measures TikTok has taken to date.\nThe unfortunate timing of section 2(a) of the Act — one day before I took office as the 47th President of the United States — interferes with my ability to assess the national security and foreign policy implications of the Act’s prohibitions before they take effect.  This timing also interferes with my ability to negotiate a resolution to avoid an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform while addressing national security concerns.  Accordingly, I am instructing the Attorney General not to take any action to enforce the Act for a period of 75 days from today to allow my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans.\nSec. 2.  Action.  (a)  I hereby order the Attorney General not to take any action on behalf of the United States to enforce the Act for 75 days from the date of this order, to permit my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course of action with respect to TikTok.  During this period, the Department of Justice shall take no action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any noncompliance with the Act, including for distributing, maintaining, or updating (or enabling the distribution, maintenance, or updating) of any foreign adversary controlled application as defined in the Act.  In light of this direction, even after the expiration of the above-specified period, the Department of Justice shall not take any action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period or any period prior to the issuance of this order, including the period of time from January 19, 2025, to the signing of this order.\n(b)  The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to issue written guidance to implement the provisions of subsection (a).\n(c)  I further order the Attorney General to issue a letter to each provider stating that there has been no violation of the statute and that there is no liability for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period, as well as for any conduct from the effective date of the Act until the issuance of this Executive Order.\n(d)  Because of the national security interests at stake and because section 2(d) of the Act vests authority for investigations and enforcement of the Act only in the Attorney General, attempted enforcement by the States or private parties represents an encroachment on the powers of the Executive.  The Attorney General shall exercise all available authority to preserve and defend the Executive’s exclusive authority to enforce the Act.\nSec. 3.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025."

    "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  The United States must grow its economy and maintain jobs for its citizens while playing a leadership role in global efforts to protect the environment.  Over decades, with the help of sensible policies that do not encumber private-sector activity, the United States has simultaneously grown its economy, raised worker wages, increased energy production, reduced air and water pollution, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  The United States’ successful track record of advancing both economic and environmental objectives should be a model for other countries.\nIn recent years, the United States has purported to join international agreements and initiatives that do not reflect our country’s values or our contributions to the pursuit of economic and environmental objectives.  Moreover, these agreements steer American taxpayer dollars to countries that do not require, or merit, financial assistance in the interests of the American people.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of my Administration to put the interests of the United States and the American people first in the development and negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or stifle the American economy.  These agreements must not unduly or unfairly burden the United States.\nSec. 3.  Implementation.  (a)  The United States Ambassador to the United Nations shall immediately submit formal written notification of the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  The notice shall be submitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Depositary of the Agreement, attached as Appendix A.  The United States will consider its withdrawal from the Agreement and any attendant obligations to be effective immediately upon this provision of notification.\n(b)  The United States Ambassador to the United Nations shall immediately submit written formal notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, or any relevant party, of the United States’ withdrawal from any agreement, pact, accord, or similar commitment made under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n(c)  The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, in collaboration with the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury, shall immediately cease or revoke any purported financial commitment made by the United States under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n(d)  Immediately upon completion of the tasks listed in subsections (a), (b), and (c), the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, in collaboration with the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury shall certify a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs that describes in detail any further action required to achieve the policy objectives set forth in section 2 of this order.\n(e)  The U.S. International Climate Finance Plan is revoked and rescinded immediately.  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall, within 10 days of this order, issue guidance for the rescission of all frozen funds.\n(f)  Within 30 days of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Agriculture, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Chief Executive Officer of the International Development Finance Corporation, Chief Executive Officer of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, President of the Export-Import Bank, and head of any other relevant department or agency shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs that details their actions to revoke or rescind policies that were implemented to advance the International Climate Finance Plan.\n(g)  The Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, and the head of any department or agency that plans or coordinates international energy agreements shall henceforth prioritize economic efficiency, the promotion of American prosperity, consumer choice, and fiscal restraint in all foreign engagements that concern energy policy.\nSec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or any other persons.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, January 20, 2025.\n"

    "content": "U.S. CapitolWashington, D.C.12:10 P.M. EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much, everybody.  (Applause.)  Wow.  Thank you very, very much.Vice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens, the golden age of America begins right now.  (Applause.)   From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world.  We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer.  During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.  (Applause.)  Our sovereignty will be reclaimed.  Our safety will be restored.  The scales of justice will be rebalanced.  The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.  (Applause.)   And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free.  (Applause.)America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.  (Applause.)  I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success.  A tide of change is sweeping the country, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.   But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face.  While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America.  As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust.  For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.   We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while, at the same time, stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad.  It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.   We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people.  Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina — who have been treated so badly — (applause) — and other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago or, more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense.  They’re raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country — some of whom are sitting here right now.  They don’t have a home any longer.  That’s interesting.  But we can’t let this happen.  Everyone is unable to do anything about it.  That’s going to change.  We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.  And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves — in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them.  All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.  (Applause.) My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and, indeed, their freedom.  From this moment on, America’s decline is over.  (Applause.) Our liberties and our nation’s glorious destiny will no longer be denied.  And we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America’s government.  Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, and I’ve learned a lot along the way.  The journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one — that, I can tell you.  Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life.  Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin’s bullet ripped through my ear.  But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason.  I was saved by God to make America great again.  (Applause.) Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)Thank you very much.  (Applause.) That is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength.  We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.  For American citizens, January 20th, 2025, is Liberation Day.  (Applause.)  It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country.   As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural.  And very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states — (applause) — and the popular vote, we won by millions of people.  (Applause.) To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote.  We set records, and I will not forget it.  I’ve heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.  Today is Martin Luther King Day.  And his honor — this will be a great honor.  But in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality.  We will make his dream come true.  (Applause.) Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.) National unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before.  In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success.  We will not forget our country, we will not forget our Constitution, and we will not forget our God.  Can’t do that.  (Applause.) Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders.  With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.  It’s all about common sense.  (Applause.) First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border.  (Applause.) All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.  We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy.  (Applause.) I will end the practice of catch and release.  (Applause.) And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.  (Applause.) Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.  (Applause.) And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.  (Applause.)  As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do.  We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before. Next, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.  (Applause.)  The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency.  We will drill, baby, drill.  (Applause.) America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have — the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth — and we are going to use it.  We’ll use it.  (Applause.) We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world.  (Applause.)  We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.  With my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal, and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers.  (Applause.) In other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice. We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago.  And thank you to the autoworkers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence.  We did tremendously with their vote.  (Applause.)   I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families.  Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.  (Applause.) For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues.  It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources.  The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.  To restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency.  (Applause.) After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I also will sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America.  (Applause.) Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents — something I know something about.  (Laughter.)  We will not allow that to happen.  It will not happen again. Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.  (Applause.) And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.  (Applause.)  This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.  (Applause.)  We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.  (Applause.)   As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.  (Applause.) This week, I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full back pay.  (Applause.) And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty.  It’s going to end immediately.  (Applause.)  Our armed forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission: defeating America’s enemies.  (Applause.) Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen.  We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end — and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.  (Applause.)   My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.  That’s what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier. I’m pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.  (Applause.) Thank you. America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world.  A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America — (applause) — and we will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs.  (Applause.) President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent — he was a natural businessman — and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United Spates — the United States — I mean, think of this — spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.  We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panama’s promise to us has been broken.  The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated.  American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape, or form.  And that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal.  And we didn’t give it to China.  We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.  (Applause.) Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history’s greatest civilization.  So, as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success.  We will not be deterred.  Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.   The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation — one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons.   And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.  (Applause.) Ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and, right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other.  There’s no nation like our nation. Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers.  The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts.  The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls.  Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth.  No one comes close. Americans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness.  They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens, and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand.  If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.   Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback.  But as you see today, here I am.  The American people have spoken.  (Applause.) I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do.  In America, the impossible is what we do best.  (Applause.) From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, D.C., our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.   They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.   Together, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.  After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history.  With your help, we will restore America promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love — and we love it so much.   We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.  So, to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.  We’re going to win like never before.  (Applause.) Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)In recent years, our nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before.  We will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism.  Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.  America will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and goodwill.  We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we will be strong, and we will win like never before.  We will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken, and we will not fail.  From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign, and independent nation.  We will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans.  The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun.  Thank you.  God bless America.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND  12:40 P.M.

He will freeze bureaucrat hiring except in essential areas to end the onslaught of useless and overpaid DEI activists buried into the federal workforce. He will pause burdensome and radical regulations not yet in effect that Biden announced.\n- President Trump is announcing an unprecedented slate of executive orders for rescission.\n- President Trump is planning for improved accountability of government bureaucrats. The American people deserve the highest-quality service from people who love our country. The President will also return federal workers to work, as only 6% of employees currently work in person.\n- President Trump is taking swift action to end the weaponization of government against political rivals and ordering all document retention as required by law. President Trump is also ending the unconstitutional censorship by the federal government. No longer will government employees pick and require the erasure of entirely true speech.\n- On the President’s direction, the State Department will have an America-First foreign policy.\n- The President will establish male and female as biological reality and protect women from radical gender ideology.\n- American landmarks will be named to appropriately honor our Nation’s history."
